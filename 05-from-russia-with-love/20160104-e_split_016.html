<p class="pindent">The blubbery arms of the soft life had Bond round the
neck and they were slowly strangling him. He was a
man of war and when, for a long period, there was no
war, his spirit went into a decline.</p>

<p class="pindent">In his particular line of business, peace had reigned
for nearly a year. And peace was killing him.</p>

<p class="pindent">At 7.30 on the morning of Thursday, August 12th,
Bond awoke in his comfortable flat in the plane-tree’d
square off the King’s Road and was disgusted to find
that he was thoroughly bored with the prospect of the
day ahead. Just as, in at least one religion, <span class="it">accidie</span> is the
first of the cardinal sins, so boredom, and particularly
the incredible circumstance of waking up bored, was
the only vice Bond utterly condemned.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond reached out and gave two rings on the bell
to show May, his treasured Scottish housekeeper, that
he was ready for breakfast. Then he abruptly flung
the single sheet off his naked body and swung his feet
to the floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was only one way to deal with boredom—kick
oneself out of it. Bond went down on his hands and did
twenty slow press-ups, lingering over each one so that his
muscles had no rest. When his arms could stand the pain
no longer, he rolled over on his back and, with his hands
at his sides, did the straight leg-lift until his stomach
muscles screamed. He got to his feet and, after touching
his toes twenty times, went over to arm and chest exercises
combined with deep breathing until he was dizzy. Panting
with the exertion, he went into the big white-tiled bathroom
and stood in the glass shower cabinet under very
hot and then cold hissing water for five minutes.</p>

<p class="pindent">At last, after shaving and putting on a sleeveless dark
blue Sea Island cotton shirt and navy blue tropical
worsted trousers, he slipped his bare feet into black
leather sandals and went through the bedroom into the
long big-windowed sitting-room with the satisfaction
of having sweated his boredom, at any rate for the time
being, out of his body.</p>

<p class="pindent">May, an elderly Scotswoman with iron grey hair and
a handsome closed face, came in with the tray and put
it on the table in the bay window together with <span class="it">The
Times</span>, the only paper Bond ever read.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond wished her good morning and sat down to
breakfast.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good morning-s.’ (To Bond, one of May’s endearing
qualities was that she would call no man ‘sir’ except—Bond
had teased her about it years before—English
kings and Winston Churchill. As a mark of exceptional
regard, she accorded Bond an occasional hint of an ‘s’
at the end of a word.)</p>

<p class="pindent">She stood by the table while Bond folded his paper
to the centre news page.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yon man was here again last night about the
Televeesion.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What man was that?’ Bond looked along the headlines.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yon man that’s always coming. Six times he’s been
here pestering me since June. After what I said to him
the first time about the sinful thing, you’d think he’d
give up trying to sell us one. By hire-purchase, too, if
you please!’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Persistent chaps these salesmen.’ Bond put down his
paper and reached for the coffee pot.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I gave him a right piece of my mind last night.
Disturbing folk at their supper. Asked him if he’d got
any papers—anything to show who he was.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I expect that fixed him.’ Bond filled his large coffee
cup to the brim with black coffee.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not a bit of it. Flourished his union card. Said he
had every right to earn his living. Electricians Union it
was too. They’re the Communist one, aren’t they-s?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, that’s right,’ said Bond vaguely. His mind sharpened.
Was it possible <span class="it">They</span> could be keeping an eye on
him? He took a sip of the coffee and put the cup down.
‘Exactly what did this man say, May?’ he asked, keeping
his voice indifferent, but looking up at her.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He said he’s selling Televeesion sets on commission
in his spare time. And are we sure we don’t want one.
He says we’re one of the only folk in the square that
haven’t got one. Sees there isn’t one of those aerial
things on the house, I dare say. He’s always asking if
you’re at home so that he can have a word with you
about it. Fancy his cheek! I’m surprised he hasn’t
thought to catch you coming in or going out. He’s
always asking if I’m expecting you home. Naturally I
don’t tell him anything about your movements. Respectable,
quiet-spoken body, if he wasn’t so persistent.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Could be, thought Bond. There are many ways of
checking up whether the owner’s at home or away. A
servant’s appearance and reactions—a glance through
the open door. ‘Well, you’re wasting your time because
he’s away,’ would be the obvious reception if the flat
was empty. Should he tell the Security Section? Bond
shrugged his shoulders irritably. What the hell. There
was probably nothing in it. Why would <span class="it">They</span> be interested
in him? And, if there was something in it, Security was
quite capable of making him change his flat.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I expect you’ve frightened him away this time.’ Bond
smiled up at May. ‘I should think you’ve heard the last
of him.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes-s,’ said May doubtfully. At any rate she had
carried out her orders to tell him if she saw anyone
‘hanging about the place’. She bustled off with a whisper
of the old-fashioned black uniform she persisted in
wearing even in the heat of August.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond went back to his breakfast. Normally it was
little straws in the wind like this that would start a
persistent intuitive ticking in his mind, and, on other
days, he would not have been happy until he had solved
the problem of the man from the Communist union
who kept on coming to the house. Now, from months
of idleness and disuse, the sword was rusty in the scabbard
and Bond’s mental guard was down.</p>

<p class="pindent">Breakfast was Bond’s favourite meal of the day. When
he was stationed in London it was always the same. It
consisted of very strong coffee, from De Bry in New
Oxford Street, brewed in an American Chemex, of
which he drank two large cups, black and without sugar.
The single egg, in the dark blue egg cup with a gold
ring round the top, was boiled for three and a third
minutes.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a very fresh, speckled brown egg from French
Marans hens owned by some friend of May in the
country. (Bond disliked white eggs and, faddish as he
was in many small things, it amused him to maintain
that there was such a thing as the perfect boiled egg.)
Then there were two thick slices of whole-wheat toast,
a large pat of deep yellow Jersey butter and three squat
glass jars containing Tiptree ‘Little Scarlet’ strawberry
jam; Cooper’s Vintage Oxford marmalade and Norwegian
Heather Honey from Fortnum’s. The coffee pot
and the silver on the tray were Queen Anne, and the
china was Minton, of the same dark blue and gold and
white as the egg-cup.</p>

<p class="pindent">That morning, while Bond finished his breakfast
with honey, he pinpointed the immediate cause of his
lethargy and of his low spirits. To begin with. Tiffany
Case, his love for so many happy months, had left him
and, after final painful weeks during which she had
withdrawn to a hotel, had sailed for America at the
end of July. He missed her badly and his mind still
sheered away from the thought of her. And it was
August, and London was hot and stale. He was due
for leave, but he had not the energy or the desire to
go off alone, or to try and find some temporary replacement
for Tiffany to go with him. So he had stayed on
in the half-empty headquarters of the Secret Service,
grinding away at the old routines, snapping at his
secretary and rasping his colleagues.</p>

<p class="pindent">Even M had finally got impatient with the surly caged
tiger on the floor below, and, on Monday of this particular
week, he had sent Bond a sharp note appointing
him to a Committee of Inquiry under Paymaster Captain
Troop. The note said that it was time Bond, as a senior
officer in the Service, took a hand in major administrative
problems. Anyway, there was no one else available.
Headquarters were short-handed and the 00 Section
was quiescent. Bond would pray report that afternoon,
at 2.30, to Room 412.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was Troop, reflected Bond, as he lit his first cigarette
of the day, who was the most nagging and immediate
cause of his discontent.</p>

<p class="pindent">In every large business, there is one man who is the
office tyrant and bugbear and who is cordially disliked
by all the staff. This individual performs an unconsciously
important role by acting as a kind of lightning
conductor for the usual office hates and fears. In fact,
he reduces their disruptive influence by providing them
with a common target. The man is usually the general
manager, or the Head of Admin. He is that indispensable
man who is a watchdog over the small things—petty
cash, heat and light, towels and soap in the lavatories,
stationery supplies, the canteen, the holiday rota, the
punctuality of the staff. He is the one man who has
real impact on the office comforts and amenities and
whose authority extends into the privacy and personal
habits of the men and women of the organization. To
want such a job, and to have the necessary qualifications
for it, the man must have exactly those qualities which
irritate and abrade. He must be parsimonious, observant,
prying and meticulous. And he must be a strong disciplinarian
and indifferent to opinion. He must be a little
dictator. In all well-run businesses there is such a man.
In the Secret Service, it is Paymaster Captain Troop,
RN Retired, Head of Admin., whose job it is, in his
own words, ‘to keep the place shipshape and Bristol
fashion’.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was inevitable that Captain Troop’s duties would
bring him into conflict with most of the organization,
but it was particularly unfortunate that M could think
of no one but Troop to spare as Chairman for this
particular Committee.</p>

<p class="pindent">For this was yet one more of those Committees of
Inquiry dealing with the delicate intricacies of the
Burgess and Maclean case, and with the lessons that
could be learned from it. M had dreamed it up, five
years after he had closed his own particular file on
that case, purely as a sop to the Privy Council Inquiry
into the Security Services which the Prime Minister
had ordered in 1955.</p>

<p class="pindent">At once Bond had got into a hopeless wrangle with
Troop over the employment of ‘intellectuals’ in the
Secret Service.</p>

<p class="pindent">Perversely, and knowing it would annoy, Bond had
put forward the proposition that, if MI5 and the Secret
Service were to concern themselves seriously with the
atom age ‘intellectual spy’, they must employ a certain
number of intellectuals to counter them. ‘Retired
officers of the Indian Army,’ Bond had pronounced,
‘can’t possibly understand the thought processes of a
Burgess or a Maclean. They won’t even know such
people exist—let alone be in a position to frequent
their cliques and get to know their friends and their
secrets. Once Burgess and Maclean went to Russia, the
only way to make contact with them again and,
perhaps, when they got tired of Russia, turn them into
double agents against the Russians, would have been to
send their closest friends to Moscow and Prague and
Budapest with orders to wait until one of these chaps
crept out of the masonry and made contact. And one
of them, probably Burgess, would have been driven to
make contact by his loneliness and by his ache to tell
his story to someone.<a id="r1_1"></a><a href="#f1_1" class="calibre10"><sup class="calibre11"><span class="calibre12">[1]</span></sup></a> But they certainly wouldn’t take
the risk of revealing themselves to some man with a
trench-coat and a cavalry moustache and a beta minus
mind.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh really,’ Troop had said with icy calm. ‘So you suggest
we should staff the organization with long-haired perverts.
That’s quite an original notion. I thought we were all
agreed that homosexuals were about the worst security
risk there is. I can’t see the Americans handing over many
atom secrets to a lot of pansies soaked in scent.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All intellectuals aren’t homosexual. And many of them
are bald. I’m just saying that . . .’ and so the argument
had gone on intermittently through the hearings of the
past three days, and the other committee members had
ranged themselves more or less with Troop. Now, today,
they had to draw up their recommendations and Bond
was wondering whether to take the unpopular step of
entering a minority report.</p>

<p class="pindent">How seriously did he feel about the whole question.
Bond wondered as, at nine o’clock, he walked out of
his flat and down the steps to his car? Was he just being
petty and obstinate? Had he constituted himself into a
one-man opposition only to give his teeth something
to bite into? Was he so bored that he could find nothing
better to do than make a nuisance of himself inside his
own organization? Bond couldn’t make up his mind.
He felt restless and indecisive, and, behind it all, there
was a nagging disquiet he couldn’t put his finger on.</p>

<p class="pindent">As he pressed the self-starter and the twin exhausts
of the Bentley woke to their fluttering growl, a curious
bastard quotation slipped from nowhere into Bond’s
mind.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Those whom the Gods wish to destroy, they first
make bored.’</p>
