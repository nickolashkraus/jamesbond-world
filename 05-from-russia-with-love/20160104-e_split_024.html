<h2 id="calibre_toc_24" class="calibre8"><a id="Page_206" class="calibre9"></a>19. The Mouth of Marilyn Monroe</h2>

<p class="pindent">The car sped through the deserted streets, past shadowy
mosques from which dazzling minarets lanced up
towards the three-quarter moon, under the ruined
Aqueduct and across the Ataturk Boulevard and north
of the barred entrances to the Grand Bazaar. At the
Column of Constantine the car turned right, through
mean twisting streets that smelled of garbage, and
finally debouched into a long ornamental square in
which three stone columns fired themselves like a
battery of space-rockets into the spangled sky.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Slow,’ said Kerim softly. They crept round the square
under the shadow of the lime trees. Down a street on
the east side, the lighthouse below the Seraglio Palace
gave them a great yellow wink.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Stop.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The car pulled up in the darkness under the limes. Kerim
reached for the door handle. ‘We shan’t be long, James.
You sit up front in the driver’s seat and if a policeman
comes along just say “<span class="it">Ben Bey Kerim’in ortagiyim</span>”. Can you
remember that? It means “I am Kerim Bey’s partner”.
They’ll leave you alone.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond snorted. ‘Thanks very much. But you’ll be
surprised to hear I’m coming with you. You’re bound
to get into trouble without me. Anyway I’m damned if
I’m going to sit here trying to bluff policemen. The
worst of learning one good phrase is that it sounds as
if one knew the language. The policeman will come
back with a barrage of Turkish and when I can’t answer
he’ll smell a rat. Don’t argue, Darko.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, don’t blame me if you don’t like this.’ Kerim’s
voice was embarrassed. ‘It’s going to be a straight killing
in cold blood. In my country you let sleeping dogs lie,
but when they wake up and bite, you shoot them. You
don’t offer them a duel. All right?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Whatever you say,’ said Bond. ‘I’ve got one bullet
left in case you miss.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Come on then,’ said Kerim reluctantly. ‘We’ve got
quite a walk. The other two will be going another way.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim took a long walking-stick from the chauffeur,
and a leather case. He slung them over his shoulder and
they started off down the street into the yellow wink
of the lighthouse. Their footsteps echoed hollowly back
at them from the iron-shuttered shop frontages. There
was not a soul in sight, not a cat, and Bond was glad
he was not walking alone down this long street towards
the distant baleful eye.</p>

<p class="pindent">From the first, Istanbul had given him the impression
of a town where, with the night, horror creeps out of
the stones. It seemed to him a town the centuries had
so drenched in blood and violence that, when daylight
went out, the ghosts of its dead were its only population.
His instinct told him, as it has told other travellers,
that Istanbul was a town he would be glad to get out
of alive.</p>

<p class="pindent">They came to a narrow stinking alley that dived steeply
down the hill to their right. Kerim turned into it and
started gingerly down its cobbled surface. ‘Watch your
feet,’ he said softly. ‘Garbage is a polite word for what
my charming people throw into their streets.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The moon shone whitely down the moist river of
cobbles. Bond kept his mouth shut and breathed through
his nose. He put his feet down one after the other, flat-footedly,
and with his knees bent, as if he was walking
down a snow-slope. He thought of his bed in the hotel
and of the comfortable cushions of the car under the
sweetly smelling lime trees, and he wondered how many
more kinds of dreadful stench he was going to run into
during his present assignment.</p>

<p class="pindent">They stopped at the bottom of the alley. Kerim
turned to him with a broad white grin. He pointed
upwards at a towering block of black shadow. ‘Mosque
of Sultan Ahmet. Famous Byzantine frescoes. Sorry I
haven’t got time to show you more of the beauties of
my country.’ Without waiting for Bond’s reply, he cut
off to the right and along a dusty boulevard, lined with
cheap shops, that sloped down towards the distant glint
that was the Sea of Marmara. For ten minutes they
walked in silence. Then Kerim slowed and beckoned
Bond into the shadows.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘This will be a simple operation,’ he said softly.
‘Krilencu lives down there, beside the railway line.’ He
gestured vaguely towards a cluster of red and green
lights at the end of the boulevard. ‘He hides out in a
shack behind a bill-hoarding. There is a front door to
the shack. Also a trapdoor to the street through the
hoarding. He thinks no one knows of this. My two men
will go in at the front door. He will slip out through
the hoarding. Then I shoot him. All right?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If you say so.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They walked on down the boulevard, keeping close
to the wall. After ten minutes, they came in sight of
the twenty-foot-high hoarding that formed a facing
wall to the T intersection at the bottom of the street.
The moon was behind the hoarding and its face in the
shadow. Now Kerim walked even more carefully,
putting each foot softly in front of him. About a
hundred yards from the hoarding the shadows ended
and the moon blazed whitely down on the intersection.
Kerim stopped in the last dark doorway and stationed
Bond in front of him, up against his chest. ‘Now we
must wait,’ he whispered. Bond heard Kerim fiddling
behind him. There came a soft plop as the lid of the
leather case came off. A thin, heavy steel tube, about
two feet long, with a bulge at each end, was pressed
into Bond’s hand. ‘Sniperscope. German model,’ whispered
Kerim. ‘Infra-red lens. Sees in the dark. Have a
look at that big film advertisement over there. That
face. Just below the nose. You’ll see the outline of a
trapdoor. In direct line down from the signal box.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond rested his forearm against the door jamb and
raised the tube to his right eye. He focused it on the
patch of black shadow opposite. Slowly the black
dissolved into grey. The outline of a huge woman’s face
and some lettering appeared. Now Bond could read the
lettering. It said: <span class="sc">niyagara. marilyn monroe ve
joseph cotten</span> and underneath, the cartoon feature,
<span class="sc">bonzo futbolou</span>. Bond inched the glass down the
vast pile of Marilyn Monroe’s hair, and the cliff of
forehead, and down the two feet of nose to the cavernous
nostrils. A faint square showed in the poster. It ran
from below the nose into the great alluring curve of
the lips. It was about three feet deep. From it, there
would be a longish drop to the ground.</p>

<p class="pindent">Behind Bond there sounded a series of soft clicks.
Kerim held forward his walking-stick. As Bond had
supposed, it was a gun, a rifle, with a skeleton butt
which was also a twist breech. The squat bulge of a
silencer had taken the place of the rubber tip.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Barrel from the new 88 Winchester,’ whispered
Kerim proudly. ‘Put together for me by a man in Ankara.
Takes the .308 cartridge. The short one. Three of them.
Give me the glass. I want to get that trapdoor lined up
before my men go in at the front. Mind if I use your
shoulder as a rest?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right.’ Bond handed Kerim the Sniperscope.
Kerim clipped it to the top of the barrel and slid the
gun along Bond’s shoulder.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Got it,’ whispered Kerim. ‘Where Vavra said. He’s a
good man that.’ He lowered his gun just as two
policemen appeared at the right-hand corner of the
intersection. Bond stiffened.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s all right,’ whispered Kerim. ‘That’s my boy and
the chauffeur.’ He put two fingers in his mouth. A very
quick, very low-pitched whistle sounded for a fraction
of a second. One of the policemen lifted his hand to
the back of his neck. The two policemen turned and
walked away, their boots ringing loudly on the paving
stones.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Few minutes more,’ whispered Kerim. ‘They’ve got
to get round the back of that hoarding.’ Bond felt the
heavy barrel of the gun slip into place along his right
shoulder.</p>

<p class="pindent">The moonstruck silence was broken by a loud iron
clang from the signal box behind the hoarding. One
of the signal arms dropped. A green pinpoint of light
showed among the cluster of reds. There was a soft
slow rumble in the distance, away to the left by
Seraglio Point. It came closer and sorted itself into
the heavy pant of an engine and the grinding clangour
of a string of badly coupled goods trucks. A faint
yellow glimmer shone along the embankment to the
left. The engine came labouring into view above the
hoarding.</p>

<p class="pindent">The train slowly clanked by on its hundred-mile journey
to the Greek frontier, a broken black silhouette against
the silver sea, and the heavy cloud of smoke from its
cheap fuel drifted towards them on the still air. As the
red light on the brake van glimmered briefly and disappeared,
there came the deeper rumble as the engine entered a
cutting, and then two harsh, mournful whoops as it whistled
its approach to the little station of Buyuk, a mile
further down the line.</p>

<p class="pindent">The rumble of the train died away. Bond felt the gun
press deeper into his shoulder. He strained his eyes into
the target of shadow. In the centre of it, a deeper square
of blackness showed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond cautiously lifted his left hand to shade his eyes
from the moon. There came a hiss of breath from
behind his right ear. ‘He’s coming.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Out of the mouth of the huge, shadowed poster,
between the great violet lips, half open in ecstasy, the
dark shape of a man emerged and hung down like a
worm from the mouth of a corpse.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man dropped. A ship going up towards the
Bosphorus growled in the night like a sleepless animal
in a zoo. Bond felt a prickle of sweat on his forehead.
The barrel of the rifle depressed as the man stepped
softly off the pavement towards them.</p>

<p class="pindent">When he’s at the edge of the shadow, he’ll start to
run, thought Bond. You damn fool, get the sights further
down.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now. The man bent for a quick sprint across the
dazzling white street. He was coming out of the shadow.
His right leg was bent forward and his shoulder was
twisted to give him momentum.</p>

<p class="pindent">At Bond’s ear there was the clunk of an axe hitting
into a tree-trunk. The man dived forward, his arms
outstretched. There was a sharp ‘tok’ as his chin or his
forehead hit the ground.</p>

<p class="pindent">An empty cartridge tinkled down at Bond’s feet.
He heard the click of the next round going into the
chamber.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man’s fingers scrabbled briefly at the cobbles. His
shoes knocked on the road. Then he lay absolutely still.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim grunted. The rifle came down off Bond’s
shoulder, Bond listened to the noises of Kerim folding
up the gun and putting away the Sniperscope in its
leather case.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked away from the sprawling figure in the
road, the figure of the man who had been, but was no
more. He had a moment of resentment against the life
that made him witness these things. The resentment was
not against Kerim. Kerim had twice been this man’s target.
In a way it had been a long duel, in which the man had
fired twice to Kerim’s once. But Kerim was the cleverer,
cooler man, and the luckier, and that had been that. But
Bond had never killed in cold blood, and he hadn’t liked
watching, and helping, someone else do it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim silently took his arm. They walked slowly away
from the scene and back the way they had come.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim seemed to sense Bond’s thoughts. ‘Life is full
of death, my friend,’ he said philosophically. ‘And sometimes
one is made the instrument of death. I do not
regret killing that man. Nor would I regret killing any
of those Russians we saw in that office today. They are
hard people. With them, what you don’t get from
strength, you won’t get from mercy. They are all the
same, the Russians. I wish your government would realize
it and be strong with them. Just an occasional little lesson
in manners like I have taught them tonight.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘In power politics, one doesn’t often have the chance
of being as quick and neat as you were tonight, Darko.
And don’t forget it’s only one of their satellites you’ve
punished, one of the men they always find to do their
dirty work. Mark you,’ said Bond, ‘I quite agree about
the Russians. They simply don’t understand the carrot.
Only the stick has any effect. Basically they’re masochists.
They love the knout. That’s why they were so happy
under Stalin. He gave it them. I’m not sure how they’re
going to react to the scraps of carrot they’re being fed
by Khrushchev and Co. As for England, the trouble
today is that carrots for all are the fashion. At home and
abroad. We don’t show teeth any more—only gums.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim laughed harshly, but made no comment. They
were climbing back up the stinking alley and there was
no breath for talk. They rested at the top and then walked
slowly towards the trees of the Hippodrome Square.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So you forgive me for today?’ It was odd to hear the
longing for reassurance in the big man’s usually boisterous
voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Forgive you? Forgive what? Don’t be ridiculous.’
There was affection in Bond’s voice. ‘You’ve got a job
to do and you’re doing it. I’ve been very impressed.
You’ve got a wonderful set-up here. I’m the one who
ought to apologize. I seem to have brought a great deal
of trouble down on your head. And you’ve dealt with
it. I’ve just tagged along behind. And I’ve got absolutely
nowhere with my main job. M will be getting pretty
impatient. Perhaps there’ll be some sort of message at
the hotel.’</p>

<p class="pindent">But when Kerim took Bond back to the hotel and
went with him to the desk there was nothing for Bond.
Kerim clapped him on the back. ‘Don’t worry, my
friend,’ he said cheerfully. ‘Hope makes a good breakfast.
Eat plenty of it. I will send the car in the morning and
if nothing has happened I will think of some more
little adventures to pass the time. Clean your gun and
sleep on it. You both deserve a rest.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond climbed the few stairs and unlocked his door
and locked and bolted it behind him. Moonlight filtered
through the curtains. He walked across and turned on
the pink-shaded lights on the dressing-table. He stripped
off his clothes and went into the bathroom and stood
for a few minutes under the shower. He thought how
much more eventful Saturday the fourteenth had been
than Friday the thirteenth. He cleaned his teeth and
gargled with a sharp mouthwash to get rid of the taste
of the day and turned off the bathroom light and went
back into the bedroom.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond drew aside one curtain and opened wide the
tall windows and stood, holding the curtains open and
looking out across the great boomerang curve of water
under the riding moon. The night breeze felt wonderfully
cool on his naked body. He looked at his watch.
It said two o’clock.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gave a shuddering yawn. He let the curtains
drop back into place. He bent to switch off the lights
on the dressing-table. Suddenly he stiffened and his
heart missed a beat.</p>

<p class="pindent">There had been a nervous giggle from the shadows
at the back of the room. A girl’s voice said, ‘Poor Mister
Bond. You must be tired. Come to bed.’</p>
