<p class="pindent">The moujiks had received the knout. General G. gave
them a few minutes to lick their wounds and recover
from the shock of the official lashing that had been
meted out.</p>

<p class="pindent">No one said a word for the defence. No one spoke
up for his department or mentioned the countless
victories of Soviet Intelligence that could be set against
the few mistakes. And no one questioned the right of
the Head of <span class="sc">smersh</span>, who shared the guilt with them,
to deliver this terrible denunciation. The Word had gone
out from the Throne, and General G. had been chosen
as the mouthpiece for the Word. It was a great compliment
to General G. that he had been thus chosen, a
sign of grace, a sign of coming preferment, and everyone
present made a careful note of the fact that, in the
Intelligence hierarchy, General G., with <span class="sc">smersh</span> behind
him, had come to the top of the pile.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the end of the table, the representative of the
Foreign Ministry, Lieutenant-General Vozdvishensky of
RUMID, watched the smoke curl up from the tip of
his long Kazbek cigarette and remembered how Molotov
had privately told him, when Beria was dead, that
General G. would go far. There had been no great
foresight in this prophecy, reflected Vozdvishensky.
Beria had disliked G. and had constantly hindered his
advancement, side-tracking him away from the main
ladder of power into one of the minor departments of
the then Ministry of State Security, which, on the death
of Stalin, Beria had quickly abolished as a Ministry. Until
1952, G. had been deputy to one of the heads of this
Ministry. When the post was abolished, he devoted his
energies to plotting the downfall of Beria, working under
the secret orders of the formidable General Serov, whose
record put him out of even Beria’s reach.</p>

<p class="pindent">Serov, a Hero of the Soviet Union and a veteran of
the famous predecessors of the MGB—the Cheka, the
Ogpu, the NKVD and the MVD—was in every respect
a bigger man than Beria. He had been directly behind
the mass executions of the 1930s when a million died,
he had been <span class="it">metteur en scéne</span> of most of the great Moscow
show trials, he had organized the bloody genocide in
the Central Caucasus in February 1944, and it was he
who had inspired the mass deportations from the Baltic
States and the kidnapping of the German atom and
other scientists who had given Russia her great technical
leap forward after the war.</p>

<p class="pindent">And Beria and all his court had gone to the gallows,
while General G. had been given <span class="sc">smersh</span> as his reward.
As for Army General Ivan Serov, he, with Bulganin
and Khrushchev, now ruled Russia. One day, he might
even stand on the peak, alone. But, guessed General
Vozdvishensky, glancing up the table at the gleaming
billiard-ball skull, probably with General G. not far
behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">The skull lifted and the hard bulging brown eyes
looked straight down the table into the eyes of General
Vozdvishensky. General Vozdvishensky managed to
look back calmly and even with a hint of appraisal.</p>

<p class="pindent">That is a deep one, thought General G. Let us put
the spotlight on him and see how he shows up on the
soundtrack.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Comrades,’ gold flashed from both corners of his
mouth as he stretched his lips in a chairman’s smile, ‘let
us not be too dismayed. Even the highest tree has an axe
waiting at its foot. We have never thought that our departments
were so successful as to be beyond criticism. What
I have been instructed to say to you will not have come
as a surprise to any of us. So let us take up the challenge
with a good heart and get down to business.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Round the table there was no answering smile to
these platitudes. General G. had not expected that there
would be. He lit a cigarette and continued.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I said that we have at once to recommend an act of
terrorism in the intelligence field, and one of our departments—no
doubt my own—will be called upon to
carry out this act.’</p>

<p class="pindent">An inaudible sigh of relief went round the table. So
at least <span class="sc">smersh</span> would be the responsible department!
That was something.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But the choice of a target will not be an easy matter,
and our collective responsibility for the correct choice
will be a heavy one.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Soft-hard, hard-soft. The ball was now back with the
conference.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It is not just a question of blowing up a building or
shooting a prime minister. Such bourgeois horseplay is
not contemplated. Our operation must be delicate,
refined and aimed at the heart of the Intelligence
apparat of the West. It must do grave damage to the
enemy apparat—hidden damage which the public will
hear perhaps nothing of, but which will be the secret
talk of government circles. But it must also cause a
public scandal so devastating that the world will lick its
lips and sneer at the shame and stupidity of our enemies.
Naturally governments will know that it is a Soviet
<span class="it">konspiratsia</span>. That is good. It will be a piece of “hard”
policy. And the agents and spies of the West will know
it, too, and they will marvel at our cleverness and they
will tremble. Traitors and possible defectors will change
their minds. Our own operatives will be stimulated.
They will be encouraged to greater efforts by our display
of strength and genius. But of course we shall deny
any knowledge of the deed, whatever it may be, and
it is desirable that the common people of the Soviet
Union should remain in complete ignorance of our
complicity.’</p>

<p class="pindent">General G. paused and looked down the table at the
representative of RUMID, who again held his gaze
impassively.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And now to choose the organization at which we
will strike, and then to decide on the specific target
within that organization. Comrade Lieutenant-General
Vozdvishensky, since you observe the foreign intelligence
scene from a neutral standpoint [this was a jibe
at the notorious jealousies that exist between the military
intelligence of the GRU and the Secret Service of the
MGB], perhaps you would survey the field for us. We
wish to have your opinion of the relative importance of
the Western Intelligence Services. We will then choose
the one which is the most dangerous and which we
would most wish to damage.’</p>

<p class="pindent">General G. sat back in his tall chair. He rested his
elbows on the arms and supported his chin on the
interlaced fingers of his joined hands, like a teacher
preparing to listen to a long construe.</p>

<p class="pindent">General Vozdvishensky was not dismayed by his task.
He had been in intelligence, mostly abroad, for thirty
years. He had served as a ‘doorman’ at the Soviet
Embassy in London under Litvinoff. He had worked
with the Tass Agency in New York and had then gone
back to London, to Amtorg, the Soviet Trade Organization.
For five years he had been Military Attaché
under the brilliant Madame Kollontai in the Stockholm
Embassy. He had helped train Sorge, the Soviet master
spy, before Sorge went to Tokyo. During the war, he
had been for a while Resident Director in Switzerland,
or ‘Schmidtland’, as it had been known in the spy-jargon,
and there he had helped sow the seeds of the sensationally
successful but tragically misused ‘Lucy’ network.
He had even gone several times into Germany as a
courier to the ‘Rote Kapelle’, and had narrowly escaped
being cleaned up with it. And after the war, on transfer
to the Foreign Ministry, he had been on the inside of
the Burgess and Maclean operation and on countless
other plots to penetrate the Foreign Ministries of the
West. He was a professional spy to his fingertips and
he was perfectly prepared to put on record his opinions
of the rivals with whom he had been crossing swords
all his life.</p>

<p class="pindent">The ADC at his side was less comfortable. He was
nervous at RUMID being pinned down in this way,
and without a full departmental briefing. He scoured
his brain clear and sharpened his ears to catch every
word.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘In this matter,’ said General Vozdvishensky carefully,
‘one must not confuse the man with his office. Every
country has good spies and it is not always the biggest
countries that have the most or the best. But Secret
Services are expensive, and small countries cannot afford
the co-ordinated effort which produces good intelligence—the
forgery departments, the radio network, the record
department, the digestive apparatus that evaluates and
compares the reports of the agents. There are individual
agents serving Norway, Holland, Belgium and even
Portugal who could be a great nuisance to us if these
countries knew the value of their reports or made good
use of them. But they do not. Instead of passing their
information on to the larger powers, they prefer to sit
on it and feel important. So we need not worry with
these smaller countries,’ he paused, ‘until we come to
Sweden. There they have been spying on us for centuries.
They have always had better information on the Baltic
than even Finland or Germany. They are dangerous. I
would like to put a stop to their activities.’</p>

<p class="pindent">General G. interrupted. ‘Comrade, they are always
having spy scandals in Sweden. One more scandal would
not make the world look up. Please continue.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Italy can be dismissed,’ went on General Vozdvishensky,
without appearing to notice the interruption. ‘They are
clever and active, but they do us no harm. They are only
interested in their own backyard, the Mediterranean.
The same can be said of Spain, except that their counter-intelligence
is a great hindrance to the Party. We have
lost many good men to these Fascists. But to mount
an operation against them would probably cost us more
men. And little would be achieved. They are not yet
ripe for revolution. In France, while we have penetrated
most of their Services, the Deuxiéme Bureau is still
clever and dangerous. There is a man called Mathis at
the head of it. A Mendés-France appointment. He
would be a tempting target and it would be easy to
operate in France.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘France is looking after herself,’ commented
General G.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘England is another matter altogether. I think we all
have respect for her Intelligence Service,’ General
Vozdvishensky looked round the table. There were
grudging nods from everyone present, including General
G. ‘Their Security Service is excellent. England, being
an island, has great security advantages and their so-called
MI5 employs men with good education and good
brains. Their Secret Service is still better. They have notable
successes. In certain types of operation, we are constantly
finding that they have been there before us. Their agents
are good. They pay them little money—only a thousand
or two thousand roubles a month—but they serve with
devotion. Yet these agents have no special privileges in
England, no relief from taxation and no special shops
such as we have, from which they can buy cheap goods.
Their social standing abroad is not high, and their wives
have to pass as the wives of secretaries. They are rarely
awarded a decoration until they retire. And yet these
men and women continue to do this dangerous work.
It is curious. It is perhaps the Public School and University
tradition. The love of adventure. But still it is odd
that they play this game so well, for they are not natural
conspirators.’ General Vozdvishensky felt that his
remarks might be taken as too laudatory. He hastily
qualified them. ‘Of course, most of their strength lies
in the myth—in the myth of Scotland Yard, of Sherlock
Holmes, of the Secret Service. We certainly have nothing
to fear from these gentlemen. But this myth is a
hindrance which it would be good to set aside.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And the Americans?’ General G. wanted to put a
stop to Vozdvishensky’s attempts to qualify his praise
of British Intelligence. One day that bit about the Public
School and University tradition would sound well in
court. Next, hoped General G., he will be saying that
the Pentagon is stronger than the Kremlin.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The Americans have the biggest and richest service
among our enemies. Technically, in such matters as radio
and weapons and equipment, they are the best. But they
have no understanding for the work. They get enthusiastic
about some Balkan spy who says he has a secret
army in the Ukraine. They load him with money with
which to buy boots for this army. Of course he goes
at once to Paris and spends the money on women.
Americans try to do everything with money. Good spies
will not work for money alone—only bad ones, of
which the Americans have several divisions.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘They have successes, Comrade,’ said General G.
silkily. ‘Perhaps you underestimate them.’</p>

<p class="pindent">General Vozdvishensky shrugged. ‘They must have
successes, Comrade General. You cannot sow a million
seeds without reaping one potato. Personally I do not
think the Americans need engage the attention of this
conference.’ The head of RUMID sat back in his chair
and stolidly took out his cigarette case.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A very interesting exposition,’ said General G. coldly.
‘Comrade General Slavin?’</p>

<p class="pindent">General Slavin of the GRU had no intention of committing
himself on behalf of the General Staff of the Army.
‘I have listened with interest to the words of Comrade
General Vozdvishensky. I have nothing to add.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colonel of State Security Nikitin of MGB felt it would
do no great harm to show up the GRU as being too
stupid to have any ideas at all, and at the same time to
make a modest recommendation that would probably
tally with the inner thoughts of those present—and that
was certainly on the tip of General G.’s tongue. Colonel
Nikitin also knew that, given the proposition that had
been posed by the Praesidium, the Soviet Secret Service
would back him up.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I recommend the English Secret Service as the object
of terrorist action,’ he said decisively. ‘The devil knows
my department hardly finds them a worthy adversary,
but they are the best of an indifferent lot.’</p>

<p class="pindent">General G. was annoyed by the authority in the man’s
voice, and by having his thunder stolen, for he also
had intended to sum up in favour of an operation
against the British. He tapped his lighter softly on the
desk to reimpose his chairmanship. ‘Is it agreed then,
Comrades? An act of terrorism against the British
Secret Service?’</p>

<p class="pindent">There were careful, slow nods all round the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I agree. And now for the target within that organization.
I remember Comrade General Vozdvishensky
saying something about a myth upon which much of
the alleged strength of this Secret Service depends. How
can we help to destroy the myth and thus strike at the
very motive force of this organization? Where does this
myth reside? We cannot destroy all its personnel at one
blow. Does it reside in the Head? Who is the Head of
the British Secret Service?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colonel Nikitin’s aide whispered in his ear. Colonel
Nikitin decided that this was a question he could and
perhaps should answer.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He is an Admiral. He is known by the letter M. We
have a <span class="it">zapiska</span> on him, but it contains little. He does not
drink very much. He is too old for women. The public
does not know of his existence. It would be difficult to
create a scandal round his death. And he would not be
easy to kill. He rarely goes abroad. To shoot him in a
London street would not be very refined.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There is much in what you say, Comrade,’ said
General G. ‘But we are here to find a target who <span class="it">will</span>
fulfil our requirements. Have they no one who is a hero
to the organization? Someone who is admired and
whose ignominious destruction would cause dismay?
Myths are built on heroic deeds and heroic people. Have
they no such men?’</p>

<p class="pindent">There was silence round the table while everyone
searched his memory. So many names to remember, so
many dossiers, so many operations going on every day
all over the world. Who was there in the British Secret
Service? Who was that man who . . . ?</p>

<p class="pindent">It was Colonel Nikitin of the MGB who broke the
embarrassed silence.</p>

<p class="pindent">He said hesitantly, ‘There is a man called Bond.’</p>
