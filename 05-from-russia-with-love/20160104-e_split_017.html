<p class="pindent">As it turned out, Bond never had to make a decision
on the Committee’s final report.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had complimented his secretary on a new summer
frock, and was half way through the file of signals that
had come in during the night, when the red telephone
that could only mean M or his Chief-of-Staff gave its
soft, peremptory burr.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond picked up the receiver. ‘007.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Can you come up?’ It was the Chief-of-Staff.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘M?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes. And it looks like a long session. I’ve told Troop
you won’t be able to make the Committee.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Any idea what it’s about?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Chief-of-Staff chuckled. ‘Well, I have as a matter
of fact. But you’d better hear about it from him. It’ll
make you sit up. There’s quite a swerve on this one.’</p>

<p class="pindent">As Bond put on his coat and went out into the
corridor, banging the door behind him, he had a feeling
of certainty that the starter’s gun had fired and that the
dog days had come to an end. Even the ride up to the
top floor in the lift and the walk down the long quiet
corridor to the door of M’s staff office seemed to be
charged with the significance of all those other occasions
when the bell of the red telephone had been the
signal that had fired him, like a loaded projectile, across
the world towards some distant target of M’s choosing.
And the eyes of Miss Moneypenny, M’s private secretary,
had that old look of excitement and secret knowledge
as she smiled up at him and pressed the switch on the
intercom.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘007’s here, sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Send him in,’ said the metallic voice, and the red
light of privacy went on above the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond went through the door and closed it softly
behind him. The room was cool, or perhaps it was the
Venetian blinds that gave an impression of coolness.
They threw bars of light and shadow across the dark
green carpet up to the edge of the big central desk.
There the sunshine stopped so that the quiet figure
behind the desk sat in a pool of suffused greenish shade.
In the ceiling directly above the desk, a big twin-bladed
tropical fan, a recent addition to M’s room, slowly
revolved, shifting the thundery August air that, even
high up above the Regent’s Park, was heavy and stale
after a week of heatwave.</p>

<p class="pindent">M gestured to the chair opposite him across the red
leather desk. Bond sat down and looked across into the
tranquil, lined sailor’s face that he loved, honoured and
obeyed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Do you mind if I ask you a personal question, James?’
M never asked his staff personal questions and Bond
couldn’t imagine what was coming.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No, sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">M picked his pipe out of the big copper ashtray
and began to fill it, thoughtfully watching his fingers
at work with the tobacco. He said harshly: ‘You
needn’t answer, but it’s to do with your, er, friend,
Miss Case. As you know, I don’t generally interest
myself in these matters, but I did hear that you had
been, er, seeing a lot of each other since that diamond
business. Even some idea you might be going to get
married.’ M glanced up at Bond and then down again.
He put the loaded pipe into his mouth and set a
match to it. Out of the corner of his mouth, as he
drew at the jigging flame, he said: ‘Care to tell me
anything about it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Now what? wondered Bond. Damn these office
gossips. He said gruffly, ‘Well, sir, we did get on well.
And there was some idea we might get married. But
then she met some chap in the American Embassy.
On the Military Attaché’s staff. Marine Corps major.
And I gather she’s going to marry him. They’ve both
gone back to the States, as a matter of fact. Probably
better that way. Mixed marriages aren’t often a success.
I gather he’s a nice enough fellow. Probably suit her
better than living in London. She couldn’t really settle
down here. Fine girl, but she’s a bit neurotic. We had
too many rows. Probably my fault. Anyway it’s over
now.’</p>

<p class="pindent">M gave one of the brief smiles that lit up his eyes
more than his mouth. ‘I’m sorry if it went wrong,
James,’ he said. There was no sympathy in M’s voice.
He disapproved of Bond’s ‘womanizing’, as he called
it to himself, while recognizing that his prejudice was
the relic of a Victorian upbringing. But, as Bond’s
chief, the last thing he wanted was for Bond to be
permanently tied to one woman’s skirts. ‘Perhaps it’s
for the best. Doesn’t do to get mixed up with neurotic
women in this business. They hang on your gun-arm,
if you know what I mean. Forgive me for asking about
it. Had to know the answer before I told you what’s
come up. It’s a pretty odd business. Be difficult to get
you involved if you were on the edge of marrying or
anything of that sort.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shook his head, waiting for the story.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right then,’ said M. There was a note of relief in
his voice. He leant back in his chair and gave several
quick pulls on his pipe to get it going. ‘This is what’s
happened. Yesterday there was a long signal in from
Istanbul. Seems on Tuesday the Head of Station T got
an anonymous typewritten message which told him to
take a round ticket on the 8 p.m. ferry steamer from
the Galata Bridge to the mouth of the Bosphorus and
back. Nothing else. Head of T’s an adventurous sort
of chap, and of course he took the steamer. He stood
up for’ard by the rail and waited. After about a quarter
of an hour a girl came and stood beside him, a Russian
girl, very good-looking, he says, and after they’d talked
a bit about the view and so on, she suddenly switched
and in the same sort of conversational voice she told
him an extraordinary story.’</p>

<p class="pindent">M paused to put another match to his pipe. Bond
interjected, ‘Who is Head of T, sir? I’ve never worked
in Turkey.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Man called Kerim, Darko Kerim. Turkish father and
English mother. Remarkable fellow. Been Head of T
since before the war. One of the best men we’ve got
anywhere. Does a wonderful job. Loves it. Very intelligent
and he knows all that part of the world like the
back of his hand.’ M dismissed Kerim with a sideways
jerk of his pipe. ‘Anyway, the girl’s story was that she
was a Corporal in the MGB. Had been in the show
since she left school and had just got transferred to the
Istanbul centre as a cipher officer. She’d engineered the
transfer because she wanted to get out of Russia and
come over.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s good,’ said Bond. ‘Might be useful to have
one of their cipher girls. But why does she want to
come over?’</p>

<p class="pindent">M looked across the table at Bond. ‘Because she’s in
love.’ He paused and added mildly, ‘She says she’s in love
with you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘In love with <span class="it">me</span>?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, with you. That’s what she says. Her name’s
Tatiana Romanova. Ever heard of her?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good God, no! I mean, no, sir.’ M smiled at the mixture
of expressions on Bond’s face. ‘But what the hell does
she mean? Has she ever met me? How does she know I
exist?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well,’ said M. ‘The whole thing sounds absolutely
ridiculous. But it’s so crazy that it just might be true.
This girl is twenty-four. Ever since she joined the MGB
she’s been working in their Central Index, the same as
our Records. And she’s been working in the English
section of it. She’s been there six years. One of the
files she had to deal with was yours.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’d like to see that one,’ commented Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Her story is that she first took a fancy to the photographs
they’ve got of you. Admired your looks and so
on.’ M’s mouth turned downwards at the corners as if
he had just sucked at a lemon. ‘She read up all your
cases. Decided that you were the hell of a fellow.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked down his nose. M’s face was non-committal.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘She said you particularly appealed to her because you
reminded her of the hero of a book by some Russian
fellow called Lermontov. Apparently it was her favourite
book. This hero chap liked gambling and spent his
whole time getting in and out of scraps. Anyway, you
reminded her of him. She says she came to think of
nothing else, and one day the idea came to her that if
only she could transfer to one of their foreign centres
she could get in touch with you and you would come
and rescue her.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ve never heard such a crazy story, sir. Surely Head
of T didn’t swallow it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now wait a moment,’ M’s voice was testy. ‘Just don’t
be in too much of a hurry simply because something’s
turned up you’ve never come across before. Suppose
you happened to be a film star instead of being in this
particular trade. You’d get daft letters from girls all over
the world stuffed with Heaven knows what sort of rot
about not being able to live without you and so on.
Here’s a silly girl doing a secretary’s job in Moscow.
Probably the whole department is staffed by women,
like our Records. Not a man in the room to look at,
and here she is, faced with your, er, dashing features
on a file that’s constantly coming up for review. And
she gets what I believe they call a “crush” on these
pictures, just as secretaries all over the world get crushes
on these dreadful faces in the magazines.’ M waved his
pipe sideways to indicate his ignorance of these grisly
female habits. ‘The Lord knows I don’t know much
about these things, but you must admit that they
happen.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled at the appeal for help. ‘Well, as a matter
of fact, sir, I’m beginning to see there is some sense in
it. There’s no reason why a Russian girl shouldn’t be
just as silly as an English one. But she must have got
guts to do what she did. Does Head of T say if she
realized the consequences if she was found out?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He said she was frightened out of her wits,’ said M.
‘Spent the whole time on the boat looking round to see
if anybody was watching her. But it seems they were the
usual peasants and commuters that take these boats, and
as it was a late boat there weren’t many passengers anyway.
But wait a minute. You haven’t heard half the story.’ M
took a long pull at his pipe and blew a cloud of smoke
up towards the slowly turning fan above his head. Bond
watched the smoke get caught up in the blades and
whirled into nothingness. ‘She told Kerim that this
passion for you gradually developed into a phobia. She
got to hate the sight of Russian men. In time this turned
into a dislike of the régime and particularly of the work
she was doing for them and, so to speak, against you.
So she applied for a transfer abroad, and since her
languages were very good—English and French—in due
course she was offered Istanbul if she would join the
Cipher Department, which meant a cut in pay. To cut a
long story short, after six months’ training, she got to
Istanbul about three weeks ago. Then she sniffed about
and soon got hold of the name of our man, Kerim. He’s
been there so long that everybody in Turkey knows what
he does by now. He doesn’t mind, and it takes people’s
eyes off the special men we send in from time to time.
There’s no harm in having a front man in some of these
places. Quite a lot of customers would come to us if
they knew where to go and who to talk to.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond commented: ‘The public agent often does better
than the man who has to spend a lot of time and energy
keeping under cover.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So she sent Kerim the note. Now she wants to know
if he can help her.’ M paused and sucked thoughtfully
at his pipe. ‘Of course Kerim’s first reactions were
exactly the same as yours, and he fished around looking
for a trap. But he simply couldn’t see what the Russians
could gain from sending this girl over to us. All this
time the steamer was getting further and further up the
Bosphorus and soon it would be turning to come back
to Istanbul. And the girl got more and more desperate
as Kerim went on trying to break down her story. Then,’
M’s eyes glittered softly across at Bond, ‘came the
clincher.’</p>

<p class="pindent">That glitter in M’s eyes, thought Bond. How well he
knew those moments when M’s cold grey eyes betrayed
their excitement and their greed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘She had a last card to play. And she knew it was
the ace of trumps. If she could come over to us, she
would bring her cipher machine with her. It’s the brand
new Spektor machine. The thing we’d give our eyes
to have.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘God,’ said Bond softly, his mind boggling at the
immensity of the prize. The Spektor! The machine that
would allow them to decipher the Top Secret traffic
of all. To have that, even if its loss was immediately
discovered and the settings changed, or the machine
taken out of service in Russian embassies and spy
centres all over the world, would be a priceless victory.
Bond didn’t know much about cryptography, and, for
security’s sake, in case he was ever captured, wished to
know as little as possible about its secrets, but at least
he knew that, in the Russian Secret Service, loss of the
Spektor would be counted a major disaster.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was sold. At once he accepted all M’s faith in
the girl’s story, however crazy it might be. For a Russian
to bring them this gift, and take the appalling risk of
bringing it, could only mean an act of desperation—of
desperate infatuation if you liked. Whether the girl’s
story was true or not, the stakes were too high to turn
down the gamble.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You see, 007?’ said M softly. It was not difficult to
read Bond’s mind from the excitement in his eyes. ‘You
see what I mean?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond hedged. ‘But did she say how she could do it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not exactly. But Kerim says she was absolutely
definite. Some business about night duty. Apparently
she’s on duty alone certain nights of the week and sleeps
on a camp bed in the office. She seemed to have no
doubts about it, although she realized that she would
be shot out of hand if anyone even dreamed of her
plan. She was even worried about Kerim reporting all
this back to me. Made him promise he would encode
the signal himself and send it on a one-time-only pad
and keep no copy. Naturally he did as she asked. Directly
she mentioned the Spektor, Kerim knew he might be
on to the most important coup that’s come our way
since the war.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What happened then, sir?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The steamer was coming up to a place called Ortakoy.
She said she was going to get off there. Kerim promised
to get a signal off that night. She refused to make any
arrangements for staying in touch. Just said that she would
keep her end of the bargain if we would keep ours. She
said goodnight and mixed in the crowd going down the
gangplank and that was the last Kerim saw of her.’</p>

<p class="pindent">M suddenly leant forward in his chair and looked
hard at Bond. ‘But of course he couldn’t <span class="it">guarantee</span> that
we would make the bargain with her.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said nothing. He thought he could guess what
was coming.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘This girl will only do these things on one condition.’
M’s eyes narrowed until they were fierce, significant slits.
‘That you go out to Istanbul and bring her and the
machine back to England.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shrugged his shoulders. That presented no
difficulties. But . . . He looked candidly back at M. ‘Should
be a piece of cake, sir. As far as I can see there’s only
one snag. She’s only seen photographs of me and read
a lot of exciting stories. Suppose that when she sees me
in the flesh, I don’t come up to her expectations.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s where the work comes in,’ said M grimly. ‘That’s
why I asked those questions about Miss Case. It’s up to
you to see that you <span class="it">do</span> come up to her expectations.’</p>
