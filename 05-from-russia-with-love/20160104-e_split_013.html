<p class="pindent">Outside the anonymous, cream painted door, Tatiana
already smelled the inside of the room. When the voice
told her curtly to come in, and she opened the door, it
was the smell that filled her mind while she stood and
stared into the eyes of the woman who sat behind the
round table under the centre light.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was the smell of the Metro on a hot evening—cheap
scent concealing animal odours. People in
Russia soak themselves in scent, whether they have
had a bath or not, but mostly when they have not,
and healthy, clean girls like Tatiana always walk home
from the office, unless the rain or the snow is too
bad, so as to avoid the stench in the trains and the
Metro.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now Tatiana was in a bath of the smell. Her nostrils
twitched with disgust.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was her disgust and her contempt for a person
who could live in the middle of such a smell that helped
her to look down into the yellowish eyes that stared at
her through the square glass panes. Nothing could be
read in them. They were receiving eyes, not giving eyes.
They slowly moved all over her, like camera lenses,
taking her in.</p>

<p class="pindent">Colonel Klebb spoke:</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You are a fine-looking girl, Comrade Corporal. Walk
across the room and back.’</p>

<p class="pindent">What were these honeyed words? Taut with a new
fear, fear of the notorious personal habits of the
woman, Tatiana did as she was told.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Take your jacket off. Put it down on the chair. Raise
your hands above your head. Higher. Now bend and
touch your toes. Upright. Good. Sit down.’ The woman
spoke like a doctor. She gestured to the chair across
the table from her. Her staring, probing eyes hooded
themselves as they bent over the file on the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">It must be my zapiska, thought Tatiana. How interesting
to see the actual instrument that ordered the
whole of one’s life. How thick it was—nearly two inches
thick. What could be on all those pages? She looked
across at the open folder with wide, fascinated eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">Colonel Klebb riffled through the last pages and shut
down the cover. The cover was orange with a diagonal
black stripe. What did those colours signify?</p>

<p class="pindent">The woman looked up. Somehow Tatiana managed
to look bravely back.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Comrade Corporal Romanova.’ It was the voice of
authority, of the senior officer. ‘I have good reports of
your work. Your record is excellent, both in your duties
and in sport. The State is pleased with you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana could not believe her ears. She felt faint
with reaction. She blushed to the roots of her hair
and then turned pale. She put out a hand to the table
edge. She stammered in a weak voice, ‘I am g-grateful,
Comrade Colonel.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Because of your excellent services you have been
singled out for a most important assignment. This is a
great honour for you. Do you understand?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Whatever it was, it was better than what might have
been. ‘Yes, indeed, Comrade Colonel.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘This assignment carries much responsibility. It bears
a higher rank. I congratulate you on your promotion,
Comrade Corporal, on completion of the assignment,
to the rank of Captain of State Security.’</p>

<p class="pindent">This was unheard of for a girl of twenty-four! Tatiana
sensed danger. She stiffened like an animal who sees
the steel jaws beneath the meat. ‘I am deeply honoured,
Comrade Colonel.’ She was unable to keep the wariness
out of her voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">Rosa Klebb grunted non-committally. She knew
exactly what the girl must have thought when she got
the summons. The effect of her kindly reception, her
shock of relief at the good news, her reawakening
fears, had been transparent. This was a beautiful, guileless,
innocent girl. Just what the konspiratsia demanded.
Now she must be loosened up. ‘My dear,’ she said
smoothly. ‘How remiss of me. This promotion should
be celebrated in a glass of wine. You must not think
we senior officers are inhuman. We will drink together.
It will be a good excuse to open a bottle of French
champagne.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Rosa Klebb got up and went over to the sideboard
where her batman had laid out what she had ordered.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Try one of these chocolates while I wrestle with
the cork. It is never easy getting out champagne corks.
We girls really need a man to help us with that sort
of work, don’t we?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The ghastly prattle went on as she put a spectacular
box of chocolates in front of Tatiana. She went back
to the sideboard. ‘They’re from Switzerland. The very
best. The soft centres are the round ones. The hard
ones are square.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana murmured her thanks. She reached out and
chose a round one. It would be easier to swallow. Her
mouth was dry with fear of the moment when she would
finally see the trap and feel it snap round her neck. It
must be something dreadful to need to be concealed
under all this play-acting. The bite of chocolate stuck in
her mouth like chewing-gum. Mercifully the glass of
champagne was thrust into her hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">Rosa Klebb stood over her. She lifted her glass merrily.
‘<span class="it">Za vashe zdarovie</span>, Comrade Tatiana. And my warmest
congratulations!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana stitched a ghastly smile on her face. She picked
up her glass and gave a little bow. ‘<span class="it">Za vashe zdarovie</span>,
Comrade Colonel.’ She drained the glass, as is the
custom in Russian drinking, and put it down in front
of her.</p>

<p class="pindent">Rosa Klebb immediately filled it again, slopping some
over the table-top. ‘And now to the health of your new
department, Comrade.’ She raised her glass. The sugary
smile tightened as she watched the girl’s reactions.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘To <span class="sc">smersh</span>!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Numbly, Tatiana got to her feet. She picked up the
full glass. ‘To <span class="sc">smersh</span>.’ The word scarcely came out.
She choked on the champagne and had to take two
gulps. She sat heavily down.</p>

<p class="pindent">Rosa Klebb gave her no time for reflection. She sat
down opposite and laid her hands flat on the table. ‘And
now to business, Comrade.’ Authority was back in the
voice. ‘There is much work to be done.’ She leant
forward. ‘Have you ever wished to live abroad, Comrade?
In a foreign country?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The champagne was having its effect on Tatiana.
Probably worse was to come, but now let it come
quickly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No, Comrade. I am happy in Moscow.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You have never thought what it might be like living
in the West—all those beautiful clothes, the jazz, the
modern things?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No, Comrade.’ She was truthful. She had never
thought about it.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And if the State required you to live in the West?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I would obey.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Willingly?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana shrugged her shoulders with a hint of
impatience. ‘One does what one is told.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The woman paused. There was girlish conspiracy in
the next question.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Are you a virgin, Comrade?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Oh, my God, thought Tatiana. ‘No, Comrade
Colonel.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The wet lips glinted in the light.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How many men?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana coloured to the roots of her hair. Russian
girls are reticent and prudish about sex. In Russia the
sexual climate is mid-Victorian. These questions from
the Klebb woman were all the more revolting for being
asked in this cold inquisitorial tone by a State official
she had never met before in her life. Tatiana screwed
up her courage. She stared defensively into the yellow
eyes. ‘What is the purpose of these intimate questions
please, Comrade Colonel?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Rosa Klebb straightened. Her voice cut back like a
whip. ‘Remember yourself, Comrade. You are not here
to ask questions. You forget to whom you are speaking.
Answer me!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana shrank back. ‘Three men, Comrade Colonel.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘When? How old were you?’ The hard yellow eyes
looked across the table into the hunted blue eyes of
the girl and held them and commanded.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana was on the edge of tears. ‘At school. When I
was seventeen. Then at the Institute of Foreign Languages.
I was twenty-two. Then last year. I was twenty-three. It
was a friend I met skating.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Their names, please, Comrade.’ Rosa Klebb picked
up a pencil and pulled a scribbling pad towards her.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana covered her face with her hands and burst
into tears. ‘No,’ she cried between her sobs. ‘No, never,
whatever you do to me. You have no right.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Stop that nonsense.’ The voice was a hiss. ‘In five
minutes I could have those names from you, or
anything else I wish to know. You are playing a
dangerous game with me, Comrade. My patience will
not last for ever.’ Rosa Klebb paused. She was being
too rough. ‘For the moment we will pass on. Tomorrow
you will give me the names. No harm will come to
these men. They will be asked one or two questions
about you—simple technical questions, that is all. Now
sit up and dry your tears. We cannot have any more
of this foolishness.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Rosa Klebb got up and came round the table. She
stood looking down at Tatiana. The voice became oily
and smooth. ‘Come, come, my dear. You must trust
me. Your little secrets are safe with me. Here, drink
some more champagne and forget this little unpleasantness.
We must be friends. We have work to do together.
You must learn, my dear Tania, to treat me as you would
your mother. Here, drink this down.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana pulled a handkerchief out of the waistband
of her skirt and dabbed at her eyes. She reached out a
trembling hand for the glass of champagne and sipped
at it with bowed head.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Drink it down, my dear.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Rosa Klebb stood over the girl like some dreadful
mother duck, clucking encouragement.</p>

<p class="pindent">Obediently Tatiana emptied the glass. She felt drained
of resistance, tired, willing to do anything to finish with
this interview and get away somewhere and sleep. She
thought, so this is what it is like on the interrogation table,
and that is the voice the Klebb uses. Well, it was working.
She was docile now. She would co-operate.</p>

<p class="pindent">Rosa Klebb sat down. She observed the girl appraisingly
from behind the motherly mask.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And now, my dear, just one more intimate little
question. As between girls. Do you enjoy making love?
Does it give you pleasure? Much pleasure?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana’s hands came up again and covered her face.
From behind them, in a muffled voice, she said, ‘Well
yes, Comrade Colonel. Naturally, when one is in love . . .’
Her voice trailed away. What else could she say? What
answer did this woman want?</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And supposing, my dear, you were not in love.
Then would love-making with a man still give you
pleasure?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana shook her head indecisively. She took her
hands down from her face and bowed her head. The
hair fell down on either side in a heavy curtain. She was
trying to think, to be helpful, but she couldn’t imagine
such a situation. She supposed . . . ‘I suppose it would
depend on the man, Comrade Colonel.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That is a sensible answer, my dear.’ Rosa Klebb
opened a drawer in the table. She took out a photograph
and slipped it across to the girl. ‘What about this man,
for instance?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana drew the photograph cautiously towards her
as if it might catch fire. She looked down warily at the
handsome, ruthless face. She tried to think, to imagine . . . ‘I
cannot tell, Comrade Colonel. He is good-looking.
Perhaps if he was gentle . . .’ She pushed the photograph
anxiously away from her.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No, keep it, my dear. Put it beside your bed and
think of this man. You will learn more about him later
in your new work. And now,’ the eyes glittered behind
the square panes of glass, ‘would you like to know what
your new work is to be? The task for which you have
been chosen from all the girls in Russia?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, indeed, Comrade Colonel,’ Tatiana looked obediently
across at the intent face that was now pointing at
her like a gun-dog.</p>

<p class="pindent">The wet, rubbery lips parted enticingly. ‘It is a simple,
delightful duty you have been chosen for, Comrade
Corporal—a real labour of love, as we say. It is a matter
of falling in love. That is all. Nothing else. Just falling
in love with this man.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But who is he? I don’t even know him.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Rosa Klebb’s mouth revelled. This would give the
silly chit of a girl something to think about.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He is an English spy.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Bogou moiou!</span>’ Tatiana clapped a hand over her mouth
as much to stifle the use of God’s name as from terror.
She sat, tense with the shock, and gazed at Rosa Klebb
through wide, slightly drunk eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ said Rosa Klebb, pleased with the effect of her
words. ‘He is an English spy. Perhaps the most famous
of them all. And from now on you are in love with
him. So you had better get used to the idea. And no silliness,
Comrade. We must be serious. This is an important
State matter for which you have been chosen as the
instrument. So no nonsense, please. Now for some
practical details.’ Rosa Klebb stopped. She said sharply,
‘And take your hand away from your silly face. And
stop looking like a frightened cow. Sit up in your chair
and pay attention. Or it will be the worse for you.
Understood?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, Comrade Colonel.’ Tatiana quickly straightened
her back and sat up with her hands in her lap as if she
was back at the Security Officers’ School. Her mind was
in a ferment, but this was no time for personal things.
Her whole training told her that this was an operation
for the State. She was now working for her country.
Somehow she had come to be chosen for an important
konspiratsia. As an officer in the MGB, she must do
her duty and do it well. She listened carefully and with
her whole professional attention.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘For the moment,’ Rosa Klebb put on her official
voice, ‘I will be brief. You will hear more later. For the
next few weeks you will be most carefully trained for
this operation until you know exactly what to do in all
contingencies. You will be taught certain foreign
customs. You will be equipped with beautiful clothes.
You will be instructed in all the arts of allurement. Then
you will be sent to a foreign country, somewhere in
Europe. There you will meet this man. You will seduce
him. In this matter you will have no silly compunctions.
Your body belongs to the State. Since your birth, the
State has nourished it. Now your body must work for
the State. Is that understood?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, Comrade Colonel.’ The logic was inescapable.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You will accompany this man to England. There,
you will no doubt be questioned. The questioning will
be easy. The English do not use harsh methods. You
will give such answers as you can without endangering
the State. We will supply you will certain answers which
we would like to be given. You will probably be sent
to Canada. That is where the English send a certain
category of foreign prisoner. You will be rescued and
brought back to Moscow.’ Rosa Klebb peered at the
girl. She seemed to be accepting all this without question.
‘You see, it is a comparatively simple matter. Have
you any questions at this stage?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What will happen to the man, Comrade Colonel?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That is a matter of indifference to us. We shall simply
use him as a means to introduce you into England. The
object of the operation is to give false information to
the British. We shall, of course, Comrade, be very glad
to have your own impressions of life in England. The
reports of a highly trained and intelligent girl such as
yourself will be of great value to the State.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Really, Comrade Colonel!’ Tatiana felt important.
Suddenly it all sounded exciting. If only she could do
it well. She would assuredly do her very best. But
supposing she could not make the English spy love her.
She looked again at the photograph. She put her head
on one side. It was an attractive face. What were these
‘arts of allurement’ that the woman had talked about?
What could they be? Perhaps they would help.</p>

<p class="pindent">Satisfied, Rosa Klebb got up from the table. ‘And
now we can relax, my dear. Work is over for the night.
I will go and tidy up and we will have a friendly chat
together. I shan’t be a moment. Eat up those chocolates
or they will go to waste.’ Rosa Klebb made a vague
gesture of the hand and disappeared with a preoccupied
look into the next room.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana sat back in her chair. So that was what it was
all about! It really wasn’t so bad after all. What a relief!
And what an honour to have been chosen. How silly
to have been so frightened! Naturally the great leaders
of the State would not allow harm to come to an innocent
citizen who worked hard and had no black marks
on her zapiska. Suddenly she felt immensely grateful to
the father-figure that was the State, and proud that she
would now have a chance to repay some of her debt.
Even the Klebb woman wasn’t really so bad after all.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana was still cheerfully reviewing the situation
when the bedroom door opened and ‘the Klebb woman’
appeared in the opening. ‘What do you think of this
my dear?’ Colonel Klebb opened her dumpy arms and
twirled on her toes like a mannequin. She struck a pose
with one arm outstretched and the other arm crooked
at her waist.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana’s mouth had fallen open. She shut it quickly.
She searched for something to say.</p>

<p class="pindent">Colonel Klebb of <span class="sc">smersh</span> was wearing a semi-transparent
nightgown in orange <span class="it">crèpe de chine</span>. It had
scallops of the same material round the low square
neckline and scallops at the wrists of the broadly flounced
sleeves. Underneath could be seen a brassiére consisting
of two large pink satin roses. Below, she wore old-fashioned
knickers of pink satin with elastic above the
knees. One dimpled knee, like a yellowish coconut,
appeared thrust forward between the half open folds
of the nightgown in the classic stance of the modeller.
The feet were enclosed in pink satin slippers with
pompoms of ostrich feathers. Rosa Klebb had taken
off her spectacles and her naked face was now thick
with mascara and rouge and lipstick.</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked like the oldest and ugliest whore in the
world.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana stammered, ‘It’s very pretty.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Isn’t it,’ twittered the woman. She went over to a
broad couch in the corner of the room. It was covered
with a garish piece of peasant tapestry. At the back,
against the wall, were rather grimy satin cushions in
pastel colours.</p>

<p class="pindent">With a squeak of pleasure, Rosa Klebb threw herself
down in the caricature of a Récamier pose. She reached
up an arm and turned on a pink shaded table-lamp
whose stem was a naked woman in sham Lalique glass.
She patted the couch beside her.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Turn out the top light, my dear. The switch is by the
door. Then come and sit beside me. We must get to
know each other better.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana walked to the door. She switched off the top
light. Her hand dropped decisively to the doorknob.
She turned it and opened the door and stepped coolly
out into the corridor. Suddenly her nerve broke. She
banged the door shut behind her and ran wildly off
down the corridor with her hands over her ears against
the pursuing scream that never came.</p>
