<p class="pindent">The Orient Express steamed slowly into Belgrade at
three o’clock in the afternoon, half an hour late. There
would be an eight hours’ delay while the other section
of the train came in through the Iron Curtain from
Bulgaria.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked out at the crowds and waited for the
knock on the door that would be Kerim’s man. Tatiana
sat huddled in her sable coat beside the door, watching
Bond, wondering if he would come back to her.</p>

<p class="pindent">She had seen it all from the window—the long wicker
baskets being brought out to the train, the flash of the
police photographer’s bulbs, the gesticulating <span class="it">chef de train</span>
trying to hurry up the formalities, and the tall figure of
James Bond, straight and hard and cold as a butcher’s
knife, coming and going.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had come back and had sat looking at her. He
had asked sharp, brutal questions. She had fought
desperately back, sticking coldly to her story, knowing
that now, if she told him everything, told him for
instance that <span class="sc">smersh</span> was involved, she would certainly
lose him for ever.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now she sat and was afraid, afraid of the web in
which she was caught, afraid of what might have been
behind the lies she had been told in Moscow—above
all afraid that she might lose this man who had suddenly
become the light in her life.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a knock on the door. Bond got up and
opened it. A tough cheerful India-rubbery man, with
Kerim’s blue eyes and a mop of tangled fair hair above
a brown face, exploded into the compartment.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Stefan Trempo at your service,’ the big smile
embraced them both. ‘They call me “Tempo”. Where
is the Chef?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sit down,’ said Bond. He thought to himself, I know
it. This is another of Darko’s sons.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man looked sharply at them both. He sat down
carefully between them. His face was extinguished. Now
the bright eyes stared at Bond with a terrible intensity
in which there was fear and suspicion. His right hand
slipped casually into the pocket of his coat.</p>

<p class="pindent">When Bond had finished, the man stood up. He didn’t
ask any questions. He said, ‘Thank you, sir. Will you
come, please. We will go to my apartment. There is much
to be done.’ He walked into the corridor and stood with
his back to them, looking out across the rails. When the
girl came out he walked down the corridor without
looking back. Bond followed the girl, carrying the heavy
bag and his little attaché case.</p>

<p class="pindent">They walked down the platform and into the station
square. It had started to drizzle. The scene, with its
sprinkling of battered taxis and vista of dull modern
buildings, was depressing. The man opened the rear
door of a shabby Morris Oxford saloon. He got in
front and took the wheel. They bumped their way over
the cobbles and on to a slippery tarmac boulevard and
drove for a quarter of an hour through wide, empty
streets. They saw few pedestrians and not more than a
handful of other cars.</p>

<p class="pindent">They stopped half way down a cobbled side-street.
Tempo led them through a wide apartment-house door
and up two flights of stairs that had the smell of the
Balkans—the smell of very old sweat and cigarette
smoke and cabbage. He unlocked a door and showed
them into a two-roomed flat with nondescript furniture
and heavy red plush curtains drawn back to show the
blank windows on the other side of the street. On a
sideboard stood a tray with several unopened bottles,
glasses and plates of fruit and biscuits—the welcome
to Darko and to Darko’s friends.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tempo waved vaguely towards the drinks. ‘Please, sir,
make yourself and Madam at home. There is a bathroom.
No doubt you would both like to have a bath.
If you will excuse me, I must telephone!’ The hard
façade of the face was about to crumble. The man went
quickly into the bedroom and shut the door behind
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">There followed two empty hours during which Bond
sat and looked out of the window at the wall opposite.
From time to time he got up and paced to and fro and
then sat down again. For the first hour, Tatiana sat and
pretended to look through a pile of magazines. Then
she abruptly went into the bathroom and Bond vaguely
heard water gushing into the bath.</p>

<p class="pindent">At about 6 o’clock, Tempo came out of the bedroom.
He told Bond that he was going out. ‘There is food in
the kitchen. I will return at nine and take you to the
train. Please treat my flat as your own.’ Without waiting
for Bond’s reply, he walked out and softly shut the door.
Bond heard his foot on the stairs and the click of the
front door and the self-starter of the Morris.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond went into the bedroom and sat on the bed and
picked up the telephone and talked in German to the
long-distance exchange.</p>

<p class="pindent">Half an hour later there was the quiet voice of M.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond spoke as a travelling salesman would speak to
the managing director of Universal Export. He said that
his partner had gone very sick. Were there any fresh
instructions?</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Very sick?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, sir, very.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How about the other firm?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There were three with us, sir. One of them caught
the same thing. The other two didn’t feel well on the
way out of Turkey. They left us at Uzunkopru—that’s
the frontier.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So the other firm’s packed up?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond could see M’s face as he sifted the information.
He wondered if the fan was slowly revolving in the
ceiling, if M had a pipe in his hand, if the Chief-of-Staff
was listening on the other wire.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What are your ideas? Would you and your wife like
to take another way home?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’d rather you decided, sir. My wife’s all right. The
sample’s in good condition. I don’t see why it should
deteriorate. I’m still keen to finish the trip. Otherwise
it’ll remain virgin territory. We shan’t know what the
possibilities are.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Would you like one of our other salesmen to give
you a hand?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It shouldn’t be necessary, sir. Just as you feel.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ll think about it. So you really want to see this sales
campaign through?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond could see M’s eyes glittering with the same
perverse curiosity, the same rage to know, as he himself
felt. ‘Yes, sir. Now that I’m half way, it seems a pity not
to cover the whole route.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right then. I’ll think about giving you another
salesman to lend a hand.’ There was a pause on the end
of the line. ‘Nothing else on your mind?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No, sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Goodbye, then.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Goodbye, sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond put down the receiver. He sat and looked at
it. He suddenly wished he had agreed with M’s suggestion
to give him reinforcements, just in case. He got
up from the bed. At least they would soon be out
of these damn Balkans and down into Italy. Then
Switzerland, France—among friendly people, away
from the furtive lands.</p>

<p class="pindent">And the girl, what about her? Could he blame her
for the death of Kerim? Bond went into the next room
and stood again by the window, looking out, wondering,
going back over everything, every expression and every
gesture she had made since he had first heard her voice
on that night in the Kristal Palas. No, he knew he
couldn’t put the blame on her. If she was an agent, she
was an unconscious agent. There wasn’t a girl of her
age in the world who could have played this role, if it
was a role she was playing, without betraying herself.
And he liked her. And he had faith in his instincts.
Besides, with the death of Kerim, had not the plot,
whatever it was, played itself out? One day he would
find out what the plot had been. For the moment he
was certain. Tatiana was not a conscious part of it.</p>

<p class="pindent">His mind made up, Bond walked over to the bathroom
door and knocked.</p>

<p class="pindent">She came out and he took her in his arms and held
her to him and kissed her. She clung to him. They
stood and felt the animal warmth come back between
them, feeling it push back the cold memory of Kerim’s
death.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana broke away. She looked up at Bond’s face.
She reached up and brushed the black comma of hair
away from his forehead.</p>

<p class="pindent">Her face was alive. ‘I am glad you have come back,
James,’ she said. And then, matter-of-factly, ‘And now
we must eat and drink and start our lives again.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Later, after Slivovic and smoked ham and peaches.
Tempo came and took them to the station and to the
waiting express under the hard lights of the arcs. He
said goodbye, quickly and coldly, and vanished down
the platform and back into his dark existence.</p>

<p class="pindent">Punctually at nine the new engine gave its new kind
of noise and took the long train out on its all-night run
down the valley of the Sava. Bond went along to the
conductor’s cabin to give him money and look through
the passports of the new passengers.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond knew most of the signs to look for in forged
passports, the blurred writing, the too exact imprints
of the rubber stamps, the trace of old gum round the
edges of the photograph, the slight transparencies on
the pages where the fibres of the paper had been
tampered with to alter a letter or a number, but the five
new passports—three American and two Swiss—seemed
innocent. The Swiss papers, favourites with the Russian
forgers, belonged to a husband and wife, both over
seventy, and Bond finally passed them and went back
to the compartment and prepared for another night
with Tatiana’s head on his lap.</p>

<p class="pindent">Vincovci came and Brod and then, against a flaming
dawn, the ugly sprawl of Zagreb. The train came to a
stop between lines of rusting locomotives captured
from the Germans and still standing forlornly amongst
the grass and weeds on the sidings. Bond read the plate
on one of them—<span class="sc">berliner maschinenbau gmbh</span>—as
they slid out through the iron cemetery. Its long
black barrel had been raked with machine-gun bullets.
Bond heard the scream of the dive-bomber and saw
the upflung arms of the driver. For a moment he
thought nostalgically and unreasonably of the excitement
and turmoil of the hot war, compared with his
own underground skirmishings since the war had turned
cold.</p>

<p class="pindent">They hammered into the mountains of Slovenia
where the apple trees and the chalets were almost
Austrian. The train laboured its way through Ljubliana.
The girl awoke. They had breakfast of fried eggs and
hard brown bread and coffee that was mostly chicory.
The restaurant car was full of cheerful English and
American tourists from the Adriatic coast, and Bond
thought with a lift of the heart that by the afternoon
they would be over the frontier into western Europe
and that a third dangerous night was gone.</p>

<p class="pindent">He slept until Sezana. The hard-faced Yugoslav plain-clothes
men came on board. Then Yugoslavia was gone
and Poggioreale came and the first smell of the soft
life with the happy jabbering Italian officials and the
carefree upturned faces of the station crowd. The new
diesel-electric engine gave a slap-happy whistle, the
meadow of brown hands fluttered, and they were loping
easily down into Venezia, towards the distant sparkle
of Trieste and the gay blue of the Adriatic.</p>

<p class="pindent">We’ve made it, thought Bond. I really think we’ve
made it. He thrust the memory of the last three days
away from him. Tatiana saw the tense lines in his face
relax. She reached over and took his hand. He moved
and sat close beside her. They looked out at the gay
villas on the Corniche and at the sailing-boats and the
people water-skiing.</p>

<p class="pindent">The train clanged across some points and slid quietly
into the gleaming station of Trieste. Bond got up and
pulled down the window and they stood side by side,
looking out. Suddenly Bond felt happy. He put an arm
around the girl’s waist and held her hard against him.</p>

<p class="pindent">They gazed down at the holiday crowd. The sun
shone through the tall clean windows of the station in
golden shafts. The sparkling scene emphasized the dark
and dirt of the countries the train had come from, and
Bond watched with an almost sensuous pleasure the
gaily dressed people pass through the patches of
sunshine towards the entrance, and the sunburned
people, the ones who had had their holidays, hasten up
the platform to get their seats on the train.</p>

<p class="pindent">A shaft of sun lit up the head of one man who
seemed typical of this happy, playtime world. The light
flashed briefly on golden hair under a cap, and on a
young golden moustache. There was plenty of time to
catch the train. The man walked unhurriedly. It crossed
Bond’s mind that he was an Englishman. Perhaps it was
the familiar shape of the dark green Kangol cap, or the
beige, rather well-used mackintosh, that badge of the
English tourist, or it may have been the grey-flannelled
legs, or the scuffed brown shoes. But Bond’s eyes were
drawn to him, as if it was someone he knew, as the
man approached up the platform.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man was carrying a battered Revelation suitcase
and, under the other arm, a thick book and some newspapers.
He looks like an athlete, thought Bond. He has
the wide shoulders and the healthy, good-looking bronzed
face of a professional tennis player going home after a
round of foreign tournaments.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man came nearer. Now he was looking straight
at Bond. With recognition? Bond searched his mind.
Did he know this man? No. He would have remembered
those eyes that stared out so coldly under the pale lashes.
They were opaque, almost dead. The eyes of a drowned
man. But they had some message for him. What was
it? Recognition? Warning? Or just the defensive reaction
to Bond’s own stare?</p>

<p class="pindent">The man came up with the wagon-lit. His eyes were
now gazing levelly up the train. He walked past, the
crêpe-soled shoes making no sound. Bond watched him
reach for the rail and swing himself easily up the steps
into the first-class carriage.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly Bond knew what the glance had meant,
who the man was. Of course! This man was from the
Service. After all M had decided to send along an extra
hand. That was the message of those queer eyes. Bond
would bet anything that the man would soon be along
to make contact.</p>

<p class="pindent">How like M to make absolutely sure!</p>
