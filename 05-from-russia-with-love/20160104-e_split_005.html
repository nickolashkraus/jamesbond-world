<p class="pindent">The naked man who lay splayed out on his face beside
the swimming pool might have been dead.</p>

<p class="pindent">He might have been drowned and fished out of the
pool and laid out on the grass to dry while the police
or the next-of-kin were summoned. Even the little pile of
objects in the grass beside his head might have been his
personal effects, meticulously assembled in full view so
that no one should think that something had been stolen
by his rescuers.</p>

<p class="pindent">To judge by the glittering pile, this had been, or
was, a rich man. It contained the typical membership
badges of the rich man’s club—a money clip, made
of a Mexican fifty-dollar piece and holding a substantial
wad of banknotes, a well-used gold Dunhill lighter,
an oval gold cigarette case with the wavy ridges and
discreet turquoise button that means Fabergé, and the
sort of novel a rich man pulls out of the bookcase
to take into the garden—<span class="it">The Little Nugget</span>—an old
P. G. Wodehouse. There was also a bulky gold wristwatch
on a well-used brown crocodile strap. It was a
Girard-Perregaux model designed for people who like
gadgets, and it had a sweep second-hand and two
little windows in the face to tell the day of the month,
and the month, and the phase of the moon. The story
it now told was <span class="sc">2.30</span> on June 10th with the moon
three-quarters full.</p>

<p class="pindent">A blue and green dragon-fly flashed out from among
the rose bushes at the end of the garden and hovered
in mid-air a few inches above the base of the man’s
spine. It had been attracted by the golden shimmer of
the June sunshine on the ridge of fine blond hairs above
the coccyx. A puff of breeze came off the sea. The tiny
field of hairs bent gently. The dragon-fly darted
nervously sideways and hung above the man’s left
shoulder, looking down. The young grass below the
man’s open mouth stirred. A large drop of sweat rolled
down the side of the fleshy nose and dropped glittering
into the grass. That was enough. The dragon-fly flashed
away through the roses and over the jagged glass on
top of the high garden wall. It might be good food,
but it moved.</p>

<p class="pindent">The garden in which the man lay was about an acre
of well-kept lawn surrounded on three sides by thickly
banked rose bushes from which came the steady
murmur of bees. Behind the drowsy noise of the bees
the sea boomed softly at the bottom of the cliff at the
end of the garden.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was no view of the sea from the garden—no
view of anything except of the sky and the clouds above
the twelve-foot wall. In fact you could only see out of
the property from the two upstairs bedrooms of the
villa that formed the fourth side of this very private
enclosure. From them you could see a great expanse of
blue water in front of you and, on either side, the upper
windows of neighbouring villas and the tops of the trees
in their gardens—Mediterranean-type evergreen oaks,
stone pines, casuarinas and an occasional palm tree.</p>

<p class="pindent">The villa was modern—a squat elongated box without
ornament. On the garden side the flat pink-washed
façade was pierced by four iron-framed windows and
by a central glass door leading on to a small square of
pale green glazed tiles. The tiles merged into the lawn.
The other side of the villa, standing back a few yards
from a dusty road, was almost identical. But on this
side the four windows were barred, and the central door
was of oak.</p>

<p class="pindent">The villa had two medium-sized bedrooms on the
upper floor and on the ground floor a sitting-room and
a kitchen, part of which was walled off into a lavatory.
There was no bathroom.</p>

<p class="pindent">The drowsy luxurious silence of early afternoon was
broken by the sound of a car coming down the road.
It stopped in front of the villa. There was the tinny
clang of a car door being slammed and the car drove
on. The doorbell rang twice. The naked man beside the
swimming pool did not move, but, at the noise of the
bell and of the departing car, his eyes had for an instant
opened very wide. It was as if the eyelids had pricked
up like an animal’s ears. The man immediately remembered
where he was and the day of the week and the
time of the day. The noises were identified. The eyelids
with their fringe of short sandy eyelashes drooped
drowsily back over the very pale blue, opaque, inward-looking
eyes. The small cruel lips opened in a wide
jaw-breaking yawn which brought saliva into the mouth.
The man spat the saliva into the grass and waited.</p>

<p class="pindent">A young woman carrying a small string bag and
dressed in a white cotton shirt and a short, unalluring
blue skirt came through the glass door and strode
mannishly across the glazed tiles and the stretch of lawn
towards the naked man. A few yards away from him,
she dropped her string bag on the grass and sat down
and took off her cheap and rather dusty shoes. Then
she stood up and unbuttoned her shirt and took it off
and put it, neatly folded, beside the string bag.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl had nothing on under the shirt. Her skin
was pleasantly sun-burned and her shoulders and fine
breasts shone with health. When she bent her arms to
undo the side-buttons of her skirt, small tufts of fair
hair showed in her armpits. The impression of a healthy
animal peasant girl was heightened by the chunky hips
in faded blue stockinet bathing trunks and the thick
short thighs and legs that were revealed when she had
stripped.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl put the skirt neatly beside her shirt, opened
the string bag, took out an old soda-water bottle
containing some heavy colourless liquid and went over
to the man and knelt on the grass beside him. She
poured some of the liquid, a light olive oil, scented, as
was everything in that part of the world, with roses,
between his shoulder blades and, after flexing her fingers
like a pianist, began massaging the sternomastoid and
the trapezius muscles at the back of the man’s neck.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was hard work. The man was immensely strong
and the bulging muscles at the base of the neck hardly
yielded to the girl’s thumbs even when the downward
weight of her shoulders was behind them. By the time
she was finished with the man she would be soaked in
perspiration and so utterly exhausted that she would
fall into the swimming pool and then lie down in the
shade and sleep until the car came for her. But that
wasn’t what she minded as her hands worked automatically
on across the man’s back. It was her instinctive
horror for the finest body she had ever seen.</p>

<p class="pindent">None of this horror showed in the flat, impassive
face of the masseuse, and the upward-slanting black
eyes under the fringe of short coarse black hair were
as empty as oil slicks, but inside her the animal whimpered
and cringed and her pulse-rate, if it had occurred
to her to take it, would have been high.</p>

<p class="pindent">Once again, as so often over the past two years, she
wondered why she loathed this splendid body, and once
again she vaguely tried to analyse her revulsion. Perhaps
this time she would get rid of feelings which she felt
guiltily certain were much more unprofessional than the
sexual desire some of her patients awoke in her.</p>

<p class="pindent">To take the small things first: his hair. She looked
down at the round, smallish head on the sinewy neck.
It was covered with tight red-gold curls that should have
reminded her pleasantly of the formalized hair in the
pictures she had seen of classical statues. But the curls
were somehow too tight, too thickly pressed against each
other and against the skull. They set her teeth on edge
like fingernails against pile carpet. And the golden curls
came down so low into the back of the neck—almost
(she thought in professional terms) to the fifth cervical
vertebra. And there they stopped abruptly in a straight
line of small stiff golden hairs.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl paused to give her hands a rest and sat back
on her haunches. The beautiful upper half of her body
was already shining with sweat. She wiped the back of
her forearm across her forehead and reached for the
bottle of oil. She poured about a tablespoonful on to
the small furry plateau at the base of the man’s spine,
flexed her fingers and bent forward again.</p>

<p class="pindent">This embryo tail of golden down above the cleft of
the buttocks—in a lover it would have been gay, exciting,
but on this man it was somehow bestial. No, reptilian.
But snakes had no hair. Well, she couldn’t help that. It
seemed reptilian to her. She shifted her hands on down
to the two mounds of the gluteal muscles. Now was
the time when many of her patients, particularly the
young ones on the football team, would start joking
with her. Then, if she was not very careful, the suggestions
would come. Sometimes she could silence these
by digging sharply down towards the sciatic nerve. At
other times, and particularly if she found the man
attractive, there would be giggling arguments, a brief
wrestling-match and a quick, delicious surrender.</p>

<p class="pindent">With this man it was different, almost uncannily
different. From the very first he had been like a lump
of inanimate meat. In two years he had never said a
word to her. When she had done his back and it was
time for him to turn over, neither his eyes nor his body
had once shown the smallest interest in her. When she
tapped his shoulder, he would just roll over and gaze
at the sky through half-closed lids and occasionally let
out one of the long shuddering yawns that were the
only sign that he had human reactions at all.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl shifted her position and slowly worked
down the right leg towards the Achilles tendon. When
she came to it she looked back up the fine body. Was
her revulsion <span class="it">only</span> physical? Was it the reddish colour
of the sunburn on the naturally milk-white skin, the
sort of roast meat look? Was it the texture of the skin
itself, the deep, widely spaced pores in the satiny
surface? The thickly scattered orange freckles on the
shoulders? Or was it the sexuality of the man? The
indifference of these splendid, insolently bulging
muscles? Or was it spiritual—an animal instinct telling
her that inside this wonderful body there was an evil
person?</p>

<p class="pindent">The masseuse got to her feet and stood, twisting her
head slowly from side to side and flexing her shoulders.
She stretched her arms out sideways and then upwards
and held them for a moment to get the blood down
out of them. She went to her string bag and took out
a hand towel and wiped the perspiration off her face
and body.</p>

<p class="pindent">When she turned back to the man, he had already
rolled over and now lay, his head resting on one open
hand, gazing blankly at the sky. The disengaged arm
was flung out on the grass, waiting for her. She walked
over and knelt on the grass behind his head. She rubbed
some oil into her palms, picked up the limp half-open
hand and started kneading the short thick fingers.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl glanced nervously sideways at the red-brown
face below the crown of tight golden curls. Superficially
it was all right—handsome in a butcher’s-boyish
way, with its full pink cheeks, upturned nose and
rounded chin. But, looked at closer, there was something
cruel about the thin-lipped rather pursed mouth,
a pigginess about the wide nostrils in the upturned
nose, and the blankness that veiled the very pale blue
eyes communicated itself over the whole face and
made it look drowned and morgue-like. It was, she
reflected, as if someone had taken a china doll and
painted its face to frighten.</p>

<p class="pindent">The masseuse worked up the arm to the huge biceps.
Where had the man got these fantastic muscles from?
Was he a boxer? What did he do with his formidable
body? Rumour said this was a police villa. The two
menservants were obviously guards of some sort,
although they did the cooking and the housework. Regularly
every month the man went away for a few days
and she would be told not to come. And from time to
time she would be told to stay away for a week, or two
weeks, or a month. Once, after one of these absences,
the man’s neck and the upper part of his body had been
a mass of bruises. On another occasion the red corner
of a half healed wound had shown under a foot of
surgical plaster down the ribs over his heart. She had
never dared to ask about him at the hospital or in the
town. When she had first been sent to the house, one
of the menservants had told her that if she spoke about
what she saw she would go to prison. Back at the
hospital, the Chief Superintendent, who had never
recognized her existence before, had sent for her and
had said the same thing. She would go to prison. The
girl’s strong fingers gouged nervously into the big
deltoid muscle on the point of the shoulder. She had
always known it was a matter of State Security. Perhaps
that was what revolted her about this splendid body.
Perhaps it was just fear of the organization that had
the body in custody. She squeezed her eyes shut at the
thought of who he might be, of what he could order
to be done to her. Quickly she opened them again. He
might have noticed. But the eyes gazed blankly up at
the sky.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now—she reached for the oil—to do the face.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl’s thumbs had scarcely pressed into the sockets
of the man’s closed eyes when the telephone in the
house started ringing. The sound reached impatiently
out into the quiet garden. At once the man was up on
one knee like a runner waiting for the gun. But he didn’t
move forward. The ringing stopped. There was the
mutter of a voice. The girl could not hear what it was
saying, but it sounded humble, noting instructions. The
voice stopped and one of the menservants showed
briefly at the door, made a gesture of summons and
went back into the house. Half way through the gesture,
the naked man was already running. She watched the
brown back flash through the open glass door. Better
not let him find her there when he came out again—doing
nothing, perhaps listening. She got to her feet, took two
steps to the concrete edge of the pool and dived gracefully
in.</p>

<p class="pindent">Although it would have explained her instincts about
the man whose body she massaged, it was as well for
the girl’s peace of mind that she did not know who he
was.</p>

<p class="pindent">His real name was Donovan Grant, or ‘Red’ Grant.
But, for the past ten years, it had been Krassno Granitski,
with the code name of ‘Granit’.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was the Chief Executioner of <span class="sc">smersh</span>, the murder
<span class="it">apparat</span> of the MGB, and at this moment he was receiving
his instructions on the MGB direct line with Moscow.</p>
