<p class="pindent">The light nudge at his ankle woke Bond. He didn’t
move. His senses came to life like an animal’s.</p>

<p class="pindent">Nothing had changed. There were the noises of the
train—the soft iron stride, pounding out the kilometres,
the quiet creak of the woodwork, a tinkle from the
cupboard over the washbasin where a toothglass was
loose in its holder.</p>

<p class="pindent">What had woken him? The spectral eye of the nightlight
cast its deep velvet sheen over the little room. No
sound came from the upper bunk. By the window,
Captain Nash sat in his place, his book open on his lap,
a flicker of moonlight from the edge of the blind
showing white on the double page.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was looking fixedly at Bond. Bond registered the
intentness of the violet eyes. The black lips parted.
There was a glint of teeth.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sorry to disturb you, old man. I feel in the mood for
a talk!’</p>

<p class="pindent">What was there new in the voice? Bond put his feet
softly down to the floor. He sat up straighter. Danger,
like a third man, was standing in the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Fine,’ said Bond easily. What had there been in those
few words that had set his spine tingling? Was it the
note of authority in Nash’s voice? The idea came to
Bond that Nash might have gone mad. Perhaps it was
madness in the room, and not danger, that Bond could
smell. His instincts about this man had been right. It
would be a question of somehow getting rid of him at
the next station. Where had they got to? When would
the frontier come?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond lifted his wrist to look at the time. The violet
light defeated the phosphorous numerals. Bond tilted the
face towards the strip of moonlight from the window.</p>

<p class="pindent">From the direction of Nash there came a sharp
click. Bond felt a violent blow on his wrist. Splinters
of glass hit him in the face. His arm was flung back
against the door. He wondered if his wrist had been
broken. He let his arm hang and flexed his fingers.
They all moved.</p>

<p class="pindent">The book was still open on Nash’s lap, but now a
thin wisp of smoke was coming out of the hole at the
top of its spine and there was a faint smell of fireworks
in the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">The saliva dried in Bond’s mouth as if he had swallowed
alum.</p>

<p class="pindent">So there had been a trap all along. And the trap had
closed. Captain Nash had been sent to him by Moscow.
Not by M. And the MGB agent in No9, the man with
an American passport, was a myth. And Bond had given
Nash his gun. He had even put wedges under the doors
so that Nash would feel more secure.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shivered. Not with fear. With disgust.</p>

<p class="pindent">Nash spoke. His voice was no longer a whisper, no
longer oily. It was loud and confident.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That will save us a great deal of argument, old man.
Just a little demonstration. They think I’m pretty good
with this little bag of tricks. There are ten bullets in it—.25
dumdum, fired by an electric battery. You must
admit the Russians are wonderful chaps for dreaming
these things up. Too bad that book of yours is only for
reading, old man.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘For God’s sake stop calling me “old man”.’ When
there was so much to know, so much to think about, this
was Bond’s first reaction to utter catastrophe. It was the
reaction of someone in a burning house who picks up
the most trivial object to save from the flames.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sorry, old man. It’s got to be a habit. Part of trying
to be a bloody gentleman. Like these clothes. All from
the wardrobe department. They said I’d get by like this.
And I did, didn’t I, old man? But let’s get down to
business. I expect you’d like to know what this is all
about. Be glad to tell you. We’ve got about half an hour
before you’re due to go. It’ll give me an extra kick telling
the famous Mister Bond of the Secret Service what a
bloody fool he is. You see, old man, you’re not so good
as you think. You’re just a stuffed dummy and I’ve been
given the job of letting the sawdust out of you.’ The
voice was even and flat, the sentences trailing away on
a dead note. It was as if Nash was bored by the act of
speaking.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ said Bond. ‘I’d like to know what it’s all about.
I can spare you half an hour.’ Desperately he wondered:
was there any way of putting this man off his stride?
Upsetting his balance?</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t kid yourself, old man,’ the voice was uninterested
in Bond, or in the threat of Bond. Bond didn’t
exist except as a target. ‘You’re going to die in half an
hour. No mistake about it. I’ve never made a mistake
or I wouldn’t have my job.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What is your job?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Chief Executioner of <span class="sc">smersh</span>.’ There was a hint of
life in the voice, a hint of pride. The voice went flat
again. You know the name I believe, old man.’</p>

<p class="pindent"><span class="sc">smersh.</span> So that was the answer—the worst answer
of all. And this was their chief killer. Bond remembered
the red glare that flickered in the opaque eyes. A killer.
A psychopath—manic depressive, probably. A man who
really enjoyed it. What a useful man for <span class="sc">smersh</span> to have
found! Bond suddenly remembered what Vavra had
said. He tried a long shot. ‘Does the moon have any
effect on you, Nash?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The black lips writhed. ‘Clever aren’t you, Mister
Secret Service. Think I’m barmy. Don’t worry. I wouldn’t
be where I am if I was barmy.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The angry sneer in the man’s voice told Bond that
he had touched a nerve. But what could he achieve by
getting the man out of control? Better humour him
and gain some time. Perhaps Tatiana . . .</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Where does the girl come into all this?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Part of the bait,’ the voice was bored again. ‘Don’t
worry. She won’t butt in on our talk. Fed her a pinch
of chloral hydrate when I poured her that glass of wine.
She’ll be out for the night. And then for every other
night. She’s to go with you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh really.’ Bond slowly lifted his aching hand on to
his lap, flexing the fingers to get the blood moving,
‘Well, let’s hear the story.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Careful, old man. No tricks. No Bulldog Drummond
stuff’ll get you out of this one. If I don’t like even the
smell of a move, it’ll be just one bullet through the
heart. Nothing more. That’s what you’ll be getting in
the end. One through the centre of the heart. If you
move it’ll come a bit quicker. And don’t forget who I
am. Remember your wrist-watch? I don’t miss. Not
ever.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good show,’ said Bond carelessly. ‘But don’t be
frightened. You’ve got my gun. Remember? Get on with
your story.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right, old man, only don’t scratch your ear while
I’m talking. Or I’ll shoot it off. See? Well, <span class="sc">smersh</span>
decided to kill you—at least I gather it was decided
even higher up, right at the top. Seems they want to
take one good hard poke at the Secret Service—bring
them down a peg or two. Follow me?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Why choose <span class="it">me</span>?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t ask me, old man. But they say you’ve got quite
a reputation in your outfit. The way you’re going to be
killed is going to bust up the whole show. It’s been
three months cooking, this plan, and it’s a beaut. Got
to be. <span class="sc">smersh</span> has made one or two mistakes lately.
That Khoklov business for one. Remember the explosive
cigarette case and all that? Gave the job to the
wrong man. Should have given it to me. I wouldn’t
have gone over to the Yanks. However, to get back.
You see, old man, we’ve got quite a planner in <span class="sc">smersh</span>.
Man called Kronsteen. Great chess player. He said
vanity would get you and greed and a bit of craziness
in the plot. He said you’d all fall for the craziness in
London. And you did, didn’t you, old man?’</p>

<p class="pindent"><span class="it">Had</span> they? Bond remembered just how much the
eccentric angles of the story had aroused their curiosity.
And vanity? Yes, he had to admit that the idea of this
Russian girl being in love with him had helped. And
there had been the Spektor. That had decided the whole
thing—plain greed for it. He said non-committally: ‘We
were interested.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Then came the operation. Our Head of Operations
is quite a character. I’d say she’s killed more people
than anyone in the world—or arranged for them to
be killed. Yes, it’s a woman. Name of Klebb—Rosa
Klebb. Real swine of a woman. But she certainly knows
all the tricks.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Rosa Klebb. So at the top of <span class="sc">smersh</span> there was a
woman! If he could somehow survive this and get after
her! The fingers of Bond’s right hand curled softly.</p>

<p class="pindent">The flat voice in the corner went on: ‘Well, she found
this Romanova girl. Trained her for the job. By the way,
how was she in bed? Pretty good?’</p>

<p class="pindent">No! Bond didn’t believe it. That first night must have
been staged. But afterwards? No. Afterwards had been
real. He took the opportunity to shrug his shoulders.
It was an exaggerated shrug. To get the man accustomed
to movement.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, well. Not interested in that sort of thing myself.
But they got some nice pictures of you two.’ Nash
tapped his coat pocket. ‘Whole reel of 16 millimetre.
That’s going into her handbag. It’ll look fine in the
papers.’ Nash laughed—a harsh, metallic laugh. ‘They’ll
have to cut some of the juiciest bits, of course.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The change of rooms at the hotel. The honeymoon
suite. The big mirror behind the bed. How well it all
fitted! Bond felt his hands wet with perspiration. He
wiped them down his trousers.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Steady, old man. You nearly got it then. I told you
not to move, remember?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond put his hands back on the book in his lap. How
much could he develop these small movements? How
far could he go? ‘Get on with the story,’ he said. ‘Did
the girl know these pictures were being taken? Did she
know <span class="sc">smersh</span> was involved in all this?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Nash snorted. ‘Of course she didn’t know about the
pictures. Rosa didn’t trust her a yard. Too emotional.
But I don’t know much about that side. We all worked
in compartments. I’d never seen her until today. I only
know what I picked up. Yes, of course the girl knew
she was working for <span class="sc">smersh</span>. She was told she had to
get to London and do a bit of spying there.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The silly idiot, thought Bond. Why the hell hadn’t
she told him that <span class="sc">smersh</span> was involved? She must have
been frightened even to speak the name. Thought he
would have her locked up or something. She had always
said she would tell him everything when she got to
England. That he must have faith and not be afraid.
Faith! When she hadn’t the foggiest idea herself what
was going on. Oh, well. Poor child. She had been as
fooled as he had been. But any hint would have been
enough—would have saved the life of Kerim, for
instance. And what about hers and his own?</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Then this Turk of yours had to be got rid of. I gather
that took a bit of doing. Tough nut. I suppose it was
his gang that blew up our Centre in Istanbul yesterday
afternoon. That’s going to create a bit of a panic.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Too bad.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Doesn’t worry me, old man. My end of the job’s
going to be easy.’ Nash took a quick glance at his wristwatch.
‘In about twenty minutes we go into the Simplon
tunnel. That’s where they want it done. More drama for
the papers. One bullet for you. As we go into the tunnel.
Just one in the heart. The noise of the tunnel will help
in case you’re a noisy dier—rattle and so forth. Then
one in the back of the neck for her—with your gun—and
out of the window she goes. Then one more for
you with <span class="it">your</span> gun. With your fingers wrapped round it,
of course. Plenty of powder on your shirt. Suicide.
That’s what it’ll look like at first. But there’ll be two
bullets in your heart. That’ll come out later. More
mystery! Search the Simplon again. Who was the man
with the fair hair? They’ll find the film in her bag, and
in your pocket there’ll be a long love letter from her to
you—a bit threatening. It’s a good one. <span class="sc">smersh</span> wrote
it. It says that she’ll give the film to the newspapers
unless you marry her. That you promised to marry her
if she stole the Spektor . . .’ Nash paused and added in
parenthesis, ‘As a matter of fact, old man, the Spektor’s
booby-trapped. When your cipher experts start fiddling
with it, it’s going to blow them all to glory. Not a bad
dividend on the side.’ Nash chuckled dully. ‘And then
the letter says that all she’s got to offer you is the machine
and her body—and all about her body and what you
did with it. Hot stuff, that part! Right? So what’s the
story in the papers—the Left Wing ones that will be
tipped off to meet the train? Old man, the story’s got
everything. Orient Express. Beautiful Russian spy
murdered in Simplon tunnel. Filthy pictures. Secret
cipher machine. Handsome British spy with career
ruined murders her and commits suicide. Sex, spies,
luxury train, Mr and Mrs Somerset . . . ! Old man, it’ll
run for months! Talk of the Khoklov case! This’ll knock
spots off it. And what a poke in the eye for the famous
Intelligence Service! Their best man, the famous James
Bond. What a shambles. Then bang goes the cipher
machine! What’s your chief going to think of you?
What’s the public going to think? And the Government?
And the Americans? Talk about security! No more atom
secrets from the Yanks.’ Nash paused and let it all sink
in. With a touch of pride he said, ‘Old man, this is
going to be the story of the century!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Yes, thought Bond. Yes. He was certainly right about
that. The French papers would give it such a send-off
there’d be no stopping it. They wouldn’t mind how
far they went with the pictures or anything else. There
wasn’t a press in the world that wouldn’t pick it up.
And the Spektor! Would M’s people or the Deuxième
have the sense to guess it was booby-trapped? How
many of the best cryptographers in the West would
go up with it? God, he must get out of this jam! But
how?</p>

<p class="pindent">The top of Nash’s <span class="it">War and Peace</span> yawned at him. Let’s
see. There would be the roar as the train went into the
tunnel. Then at once the muffled click and the bullet.
Bond’s eyes stared into the violet gloom, measuring the
depth of the shadow in his corner under the roof of
the top bunk, remembering exactly where his attaché
case stood on the floor, guessing what Nash would do
after he had fired.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said: ‘You took a bit of a gamble on my letting
you team up at Trieste. And how did you know the
code of the month?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Nash said patiently, ‘You don’t seem to get the picture,
old man. <span class="sc">smersh</span> is good—really good. There’s nothing
better. We know your code of the month for every year.
If anyone in your show noticed these things, noticed
the pattern of them, like my show does, you’d realize
that every January you lose one of your small chaps
somewhere—maybe Tokyo, maybe Timbuktu. <span class="sc">smersh</span>
just picks one and takes him. Then they screw the code
for the year out of him. Anything else he knows, of
course. But it’s the code they’re after. Then it’s passed
round the Centres. Simple as falling off a log, old
man.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond dug his nails into the palms of his hands.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘As for picking you up at Trieste, old man, I didn’t.
Rode down with you—in the front of the train. Got out
as we stopped and walked back up the platform. You
see, old man, we were waiting for you in Belgrade. Knew
you’d call your Chief—or the Embassy or someone.
Been listening in on that Yugoslav’s telephone for weeks.
Pity we didn’t understand the codeword he shot through
to Istanbul. Might have stopped the firework display, or
anyway saved our chaps. But the main target was you,
old man, and we certainly had you sewn up all right. You
were in the killing bottle from the minute you got off
that plane in Turkey. It was only a question of when to
stuff the cork in.’ Nash took another quick glance at his
watch. He looked up. His grinning teeth glistered violet.
‘Pretty soon now, old man. It’s just cork-hour minus
fifteen.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond thought: we knew <span class="sc">smersh</span> was good, but we
never knew they were as good as this. The knowledge
was vital. Somehow he must get it back. He <span class="sc">must</span>.
Bond’s mind raced round the details of his pitifully thin,
pitifully desperate plan.</p>

<p class="pindent">He said: ‘<span class="sc">smersh</span> seems to have thought things out
pretty well. Must have taken a lot of trouble. There’s
only one thing . . .’ Bond let his voice hang in the
air.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What’s that, old man?’ Nash, thinking of his report,
was alert.</p>

<p class="pindent">The train began to slow down. Domodossola. The
Italian frontier. What about customs? But Bond remembered.
There were no formalities for the through
carriages until they got to France, to the frontier,
Vallorbes. Even then not for the sleeping cars. These
expresses cut straight across Switzerland. It was only
people who got out at Brigue or Lausanne who had to
go through customs in the stations.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, come on, old man.’ Nash sounded hooked.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not without a cigarette.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Okay. Go ahead. But if there’s a move I don’t like,
you’ll be dead.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond slipped his right hand into his hip-pocket. He
drew out his broad gunmetal cigarette case. Opened it.
Took out a cigarette. Took his lighter out of his trouser
pocket. Lit the cigarette and put the lighter back. He left
the cigarette case on his lap beside the book. He put his
left hand casually over the book and the cigarette case
as if to prevent them slipping off his lap. He puffed away
at his cigarette. If only it had been a trick one—magnesium
flare, or anything he could throw in the man’s
face! If only his Service went in for those explosive toys!
But at least he had achieved his objective and hadn’t
been shot in the process. That was a start.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You see.’ Bond described an airy circle with his cigarette
to distract Nash’s attention. His left hand slipped
the flat cigarette case between the pages of his book.
‘You see, it looks all right, but what about you? What
are you going to do after we come out of the Simplon?
The conductor knows you’re mixed up with us. They’ll
be after you in a flash.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh that,’ Nash’s voice was bored again. ‘You don’t
seem to have hoisted in that the Russians think these
things out. I get off at Dijon and take a car to Paris. I
get lost there. A bit of “Third Man” stuff won’t do the
story any harm. Anyway it’ll come out later when they
dig the second bullet out of you and can’t find the
second gun. They won’t catch up with me. Matter of
fact, I’ve got a date at noon tomorrow—Room 204 at
the Ritz Hotel, making my report to Rosa. She wants
to get the kudos for this job. Then I turn into her
chauffeur and we drive to Berlin. Come to think of it,
old man,’ the flat voice showed emotion, became greedy,
‘I think she may have the Order of Lenin for me in
her bag. Lovely grub, as they say.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The train began to move. Bond tensed. In a few
minutes it would come. What a way to die, if he was
going to die. Through his own stupidity—blind, lethal
stupidity. And lethal for Tatiana. Christ! At any moment
he could have done something to dodge this shambles.
There had been no lack of opportunity. But conceit
and curiosity and four days of love had sucked him
along on the easy stream down which it had been
planned that he should drift. That was the damnable
part of the whole business—the triumph for <span class="sc">smersh</span>,
the one enemy he had always sworn to defeat wherever
he met it. We will do this, and he will do that. ‘Comrades,
it is easy with a vain fool like this Bond. Watch him
take the bait. You will see. I tell you he’s a fool. All
Englishmen are fools.’ And Tatiana, the lure—the darling
lure. Bond thought of their first night. The black stockings
and the velvet ribbon. And all the time <span class="sc">smersh</span>
had been watching, watching him go through his
conceited paces, as it had been planned that he would,
so that the smear could be built up—the smear on him,
the smear on M who had sent him to Istanbul, the
smear on the Service that lived on the myth of its name.
God, what a mess! If only . . . if only his tiny grain of
a plan might work!</p>

<p class="pindent">Ahead, the rumble of the train became a deep
boom.</p>

<p class="pindent">A few more seconds. A few more yards.</p>

<p class="pindent">The oval mouth between the white pages seemed to
gape wider. In a second the dark tunnel would switch
out the moonlight on the pages and the blue tongue
would lick out for him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sweet dreams, you English bastard.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The rumble became a great swift clanging roar.</p>

<p class="pindent">The spine of the book bloomed flame.</p>

<p class="pindent">The bullet, homing on Bond’s heart, flashed over its
two quiet yards.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond pitched forward on to the floor and lay sprawled
under the funereal violet light.</p>
