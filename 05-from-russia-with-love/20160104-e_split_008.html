<h2 id="calibre_toc_9" class="calibre8"><a id="Page_34" class="calibre9"></a>4. The Moguls of Death</h2>

<p class="pindent"><span class="sc">smersh</span> is the official murder organization of the Soviet
government. It operates both at home and abroad and,
in 1955, it employed a total of 40,000 men and women.
<span class="sc">smersh</span> is a contraction of ‘Smiert Spionam’, which
means ‘Death to Spies’. It is a name used only among
its staff and among Soviet officials. No sane member
of the public would dream of allowing the word to
pass his lips.</p>

<p class="pindent">The headquarters of <span class="sc">smersh</span> is a very large and ugly
modern building on the Sretenka Ulitsa. It is No 13 on
this wide, dull street, and pedestrians keep their eyes to
the ground as they pass the two sentries with submachine
guns who stand on either side of the broad
steps leading up to the big iron double door. If they
remember in time, or can do so inconspicuously, they
cross the street and pass by on the other side.</p>

<p class="pindent">The direction of <span class="sc">smersh</span> is carried out from the 2nd
floor. The most important room on the 2nd floor is a
very large light room painted in the pale olive green
that is the common denominator of government offices
all over the world. Opposite the sound-proofed door,
two wide windows look over the courtyard at the back
of the building. The floor is close-fitted with a colourful
Caucasian carpet of the finest quality. Across the far
left-hand corner of the room stands a massive oak desk.
The top of the desk is covered with red velvet under
a thick sheet of plate glass.</p>

<p class="pindent">On the left side of the desk are <span class="sc">in</span> and <span class="sc">out</span> baskets
and on the right four telephones.</p>

<p class="pindent">From the centre of the desk, to form a T with it, a
conference table stretches diagonally out across the
room. Eight straight-backed red leather chairs are drawn
up to it. This table is also covered with red velvet, but
without protective glass. Ashtrays are on the table, and
two heavy carafes of water with glasses.</p>

<p class="pindent">On the walls are four large pictures in gold frames.
In 1955, these were a portrait of Stalin over the
door, one of Lenin between the two windows and,
facing each other on the other two walls, portraits
of Bulganin and, where until January 13th, 1954, a
portrait of Beria had hung, a portrait of Army General
Ivan Aleksandrovitch Serov, Chief of the Committee
of State Security.</p>

<p class="pindent">On the left-hand wall, under the portrait of Bulganin,
stands a large <span class="it">televisor</span>, or TV set, in a handsome polished
oak cabinet. Concealed in this is a tape-recorder which
can be switched on from the desk. The microphone
for the recorder stretches under the whole area of the
conference table and its leads are concealed in the legs
of the table. Next to the televisor is a small door leading
into a personal lavatory and washroom and into a small
projection room for showing secret films.</p>

<p class="pindent">Under the portrait of General Serov is a bookcase
containing, on the top shelves, the works of Marx,
Engels, Lenin and Stalin, and more accessibly, books in
all languages on espionage, counter-espionage, police
methods and criminology. Next to the bookcase, against
the wall, stands a long narrow table on which are a
dozen large leather-bound albums with dates stamped
in gold on the covers. These contain photographs of
Soviet citizens and foreigners who have been assassinated
by <span class="sc">smersh</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">About the time Grant was coming into land at
Tushino Airport, just before 11.30 at night, a tough-looking,
thick-set man of about fifty was standing at
this table leafing through the volume for 1954.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Head of <span class="sc">smersh</span>, Colonel General Grubozaboyschikov,
known in the building as ‘G.’, was dressed in
a neat khaki tunic with a high collar, and dark blue
cavalry trousers with two thin red stripes down the
sides. The trousers ended in riding boots of soft,
highly polished black leather. On the breast of the
tunic were three rows of medal ribbons—two Orders
of Lenin, Order of Suvorov, Order of Alexander
Nevsky, Order of the Red Banner, two Orders of the
Red Star, the Twenty Years Service medal and medals
for the Defence of Moscow and the Capture of
Berlin. At the tail of these came the rose-pink and
grey ribbon of the British CBE, and the claret and
white ribbon of the American Medal for Merit. Above
the ribbons hung the gold star of a Hero of the Soviet
Union.</p>

<p class="pindent">Above the high collar of the tunic the face was narrow
and sharp. There were flabby pouches under the eyes,
which were round and brown and protruded like
polished marbles below thick black brows. The skull
was shaven clean and the tight white skin glittered in
the light of the central chandelier. The mouth was broad
and grim above a deeply cleft chin. It was a hard,
unyielding face of formidable authority.</p>

<p class="pindent">One of the telephones on the desk buzzed softly.
The man walked with tight and precise steps to his tall
chair behind the desk. He sat down and picked up the
receiver of the telephone marked in white with the
letters VCh. These letters are short for <span class="it">vysokochastoty</span>, or
high frequency. Only some fifty supreme officials are
connected to the VCh switchboard, and all are Ministers
of State or Heads of selected Departments. It is served
by a small exchange in the Kremlin operated by professional
security officers. Even they cannot overhear
conversations on it, but every word spoken over its lines
is automatically recorded.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Serov speaking. What action has been taken since
the meeting of the Praesidium this morning?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I have a meeting here in a few minutes’ time, Comrade
General—RUMID, GRU and of course MGB. After
that, if action is agreed, I shall have a meeting with my
Head of Operations and Head of Plans. In case liquidation
is decided upon, I have taken the precaution of
bringing the necessary operative to Moscow. This time
I shall myself supervise the preparations. We do not
want another Khoklov affair.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The devil knows we don’t. Telephone me after the
first meeting. I wish to report to the Praesidium
tomorrow morning.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Certainly, Comrade General.’</p>

<p class="pindent">General G. put back the receiver and pressed a bell
under his desk. At the same time he switched on the
wire-recorder. His ADC, an MGB captain, came in.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Have they arrived?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, Comrade General.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Bring them in.’</p>

<p class="pindent">In a few minutes six men, five of them in uniform,
filed in through the door and, with hardly a glance at
the man behind the desk, took their places at the conference
table. They were three senior officers, heads of
their departments, and each was accompanied by an
ADC. In the Soviet Union, no man goes alone to a
conference. For his own protection, and for the
reassurance of his department, he invariably takes a
witness so that his department can have independent
versions of what went on at the conference and, above
all, of what was said on its behalf. This is important in
case there is a subsequent investigation. No notes are
taken at the conference and decisions are passed back
to departments by word of mouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">On the far side of the table sat Lieutenant-General
Slavin, head of the GRU, the intelligence department
of the General Staff of the Army, with a full colonel
beside him. At the end of the table sat Lieutenant-General
Vozdvishensky of RUMID, the Intelligence
Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with a
middle-aged man in plain clothes. With his back to the
door, sat Colonel of State Security Nikitin, Head of
Intelligence for the MGB, the Soviet Secret Service,
with a major at his side.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good evening, Comrades.’</p>

<p class="pindent">A polite, careful murmur came from the three senior
officers. Each one knew, and thought he was the only
one to know, that the room was wired for sound, and
each one, without telling his ADC, had decided to utter
the bare minimum of words consonant with good discipline
and the needs of the State.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Let us smoke.’ General G. took out a packet of
Moskwa-Volga cigarettes and lit one with an American
Zippo lighter. There was a clicking of lighters round the
table. General G. pinched the long cardboard tube of his
cigarette so that it was almost flat and put it between his
teeth on the right side of his mouth. He stretched his lips
back from his teeth and started talking in short clipped
sentences that came out with something of a hiss from
between the teeth and the uptilted cigarette.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Comrades, we meet under instructions from Comrade
General Serov. General Serov, on behalf of the Praesidium,
has ordered me to make known to you certain
matters of State Policy. We are then to confer and
recommend a course of action which will be in line
with this Policy and assist it. We have to reach our decision
quickly. But our decision will be of supreme
importance to the State. It will therefore have to be a
correct decision.’</p>

<p class="pindent">General G. paused to allow the significance of his
words time to sink in. One by one, he slowly examined
the faces of the three senior officers at the table. Their
eyes looked stolidly back at him. Inside, these extremely
important men were perturbed. They were about to
look through the furnace door. They were about to learn
a State secret, the knowledge of which might one day
have most dangerous consequences for them. Sitting in
the quiet room, they felt bathed in the dreadful incandescence
that shines out from the centre of all power
in the Soviet Union—the High Praesidium.</p>

<p class="pindent">The final ash fell off the end of General G.’s cigarette
on to his tunic. He brushed it off and threw the cardboard
butt into the basket for secret waste beside his
desk. He lit another cigarette and spoke through it.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Our recommendation concerns a conspicuous act
of terrorism to be carried out in enemy territory within
three months.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Six pairs of expressionless eyes stared at the head of
<span class="sc">smersh</span>, waiting.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Comrades,’ General G. leant back in his chair and
his voice became expository, ‘the foreign policy of the
USSR has entered a new phase. Formerly, it was a
“hard” policy—a policy [he allowed himself the joke
of Stalin’s name] of steel. This policy, effective as it
was, built up tensions in the West, notably in America,
which were becoming dangerous. The Americans are
unpredictable people. They are hysterical. The reports
of our Intelligence began to indicate that we were
pushing America to the brink of an undeclared atomic
attack on the USSR. You have read these reports and
you know what I say is true. We do not want such a
war. If there is to be a war, it is we who will choose
the time. Certain powerful Americans, notably the
Pentagon Group led by Admiral Radford, were helped
in their firebrand schemes by the very successes of our
“hard” policy. So it was decided that the time had come
to change our methods, while maintaining our aims. A
new policy was created—the “hard-soft” policy. Geneva
was the beginning of this policy. We were “soft”. China
threatens Quemoy and Matsu. We are “hard”. We open
our frontiers to a lot of newspaper men and actors and
artists although we know many of them to be spies. Our
leaders laugh and make jokes at receptions in Moscow.
In the middle of the jokes we drop the biggest test
bomb of all time. Comrades Bulganin and Khrushchev
and Comrade General Serov [General G. carefully included
the names for the ears of the tape-recorder] visit India
and the East and blackguard the English. When they
get back, they have friendly discussions with the British
Ambassador about their forthcoming goodwill visit to
London. And so it goes on—the stick and then the
carrot, the smile and then the frown. And the West is
confused. Tensions are relaxed before they have time
to harden. The reactions of our enemies are clumsy,
their strategy disorganized. Meanwhile the common
people laugh at our jokes, cheer our football teams and
slobber with delight when we release a few prisoners
of war whom we wish to feed no longer!’</p>

<p class="pindent">There were smiles of pleasure and pride round the
table. What a brilliant policy! What fools we are making
of them in the West!</p>

<p class="pindent">‘At the same time,’ continued General G., himself
smiling thinly at the pleasure he had caused, ‘we continue
to forge everywhere stealthily ahead—revolution in
Morocco, arms to Egypt, friendship with Yugoslavia,
trouble in Cyprus, riots in Turkey, strikes in England,
great political gains in France—there is no front in the
world on which we are not quietly advancing.’</p>

<p class="pindent">General G. saw the eyes shining greedily round the
table. The men were softened up. Now it was time to
be hard. Now it was time for them to feel the new
policy on themselves. The Intelligence services would
also have to pull their weight in this great game that
was being played on their behalf. Smoothly General G.
leaned forward. He planted his right elbow on the desk
and raised his fist in the air.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But Comrades,’ his voice was soft, ‘where has there
been failure in carrying out the State Policy of the
USSR? Who has all along been soft when we wished
to be hard? Who has suffered defeats while victory was
going to all other departments of the State? Who, with
its stupid blunders, has made the Soviet Union look
foolish and weak throughout the world? WHO?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The voice had risen almost to a scream. General G.
thought how well he was delivering the denunciation
demanded by the Praesidium. How splendid it would
sound when the tape was played back to Serov!</p>

<p class="pindent">He glared down the conference table at the pale,
expectant faces. General G.’s fist crashed forward on to
the desk.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The whole Intelligence apparat of the Soviet Union,
Comrades.’ The voice was now a furious bellow. ‘It is we
who are the sluggards, the saboteurs, the traitors! It is
we who are failing the Soviet Union in its great and
glorious struggle! We!’ His arm swept round the room.
‘All of us!’ The voice came back to normal, became more
reasonable. ‘Comrades, look at the record. <span class="it">Sookin Sin</span> [he
allowed himself the peasant obscenity], son-of-a-bitch,
look at the record! First we lose Gouzenko and the whole
of the Canadian apparat and the scientist Fuchs, then
the American apparat is cleaned up, then we lose men
like Tokaev, then comes the scandalous Khoklov affair
which did great damage to our country, then Petrov and
his wife in Australia—a bungled business if ever there
was one! The list is endless—defeat after defeat, and the
devil knows I have not mentioned the half of it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">General G. paused. He continued in his softest voice.
‘Comrades, I have to tell you that unless tonight we
make a recommendation for a great Intelligence victory,
and unless we act correctly on that recommendation,
if it is approved, there will be trouble.’</p>

<p class="pindent">General G. sought for a final phrase to convey the
threat without defining it. He found it. ‘There will be,’
he paused and looked, with artificial mildness, down
the table, ‘displeasure.’</p>
