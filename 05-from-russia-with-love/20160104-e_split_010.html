<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Y*b**nna mat!</span>’ The gross obscenity was a favourite
with General G. His hand slapped down on the desk.
‘Comrade, there certainly is “a man called Bond” as
you put it.’ His voice was sarcastic. ‘James Bond. [He
pronounced it “Shems”.] And nobody, myself
included, could think of this spy’s name! We are
indeed forgetful. No wonder the Intelligence apparat
is under criticism.’</p>

<p class="pindent">General Vozdvishensky felt he should defend himself
and his department. ‘There are countless enemies of
the Soviet Union, Comrade General,’ he protested, ‘If
I want their names, I send to the Central Index for
them. Certainly I know the name of this Bond. He has
been a great trouble to us at different times. But today
my mind is full of other names—names of people
who are causing us trouble today, this week. I am
interested in football, but I cannot remember the name
of every foreigner who has scored a goal against the
Dynamos.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You are pleased to joke, Comrade,’ said General G.
to underline this out-of-place comment. ‘This is a
serious matter. I for one admit my fault in not remembering
the name of this notorious agent. Comrade
Colonel Nikitin will no doubt refresh our memories
further, but I recall that this Bond has at least twice
frustrated the operations of <span class="sc">smersh</span>. That is,’ he added,
‘before I assumed control of the department. There
was this affair in France, at that Casino town. The man
Le Chiffre. An excellent leader of the Party in France.
He foolishly got into some money troubles. But he
would have got out of them if this Bond had not
interfered. I recall that the Department had to act
quickly and liquidate the Frenchman. The executioner
should have dealt with the Englishman at the same time,
but he did not. Then there was this Negro of ours in
Harlem. A great man—one of the greatest foreign
agents we have ever employed, and with a vast network
behind him. There was some business about a treasure
in the Caribbean. I forget the details. This Englishman
was sent out by the Secret Service and smashed the
whole organization and killed our man. It was a great
reverse. Once again my predecessor should have
proceeded ruthlessly against this English spy.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colonel Nikitin broke in. ‘We had a similar experience
in the case of the German, Drax, and the rocket. You
will recall the matter, Comrade General. A most
important konspiratsia. The General Staff were deeply
involved. It was a matter of High Policy which could
have borne decisive fruit. But again it was this Bond
who frustrated the operation. The German was killed.
There were grave consequences for the State. There
followed a period of serious embarrassment which was
only solved with difficulty.’</p>

<p class="pindent">General Slavin of GRU felt that he should say
something. The rocket had been an Army operation and
its failure had been laid at the door of GRU. Nikitin
knew this perfectly well. As usual MGB was trying to
make trouble for GRU—raking up old history in this
manner. ‘We asked for this man to be dealt with by your
department, Comrade Colonel,’ he said icily. ‘I cannot
recall that any action followed our request. If it had, we
should not now be having to bother with him.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colonel Nikitin’s temples throbbed with rage. He
controlled himself. ‘With due respect, Comrade General,’
he said in a loud, sarcastic voice, ‘the request of GRU
was not confirmed by Higher Authority. Further embarrassment
with England was not desired. Perhaps that
detail has slipped your memory. In any case, if such a
request had reached MGB, it would have been referred
to <span class="sc">smersh</span> for action.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My department received no such request,’ said
General G. sharply. ‘Or the execution of this man would
have rapidly followed. However, this is no time for
historical researches. The rocket affair was three years
ago. Perhaps the MGB could tell us of the more recent
activities of this man.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colonel Nikitin whispered hurriedly with his aide. He
turned back to the table. ‘We have very little further
information, Comrade General,’ he said defensively. ‘We
believe that he was involved in some diamond smuggling
affair. That was last year. Between Africa and
America. The case did not concern us. Since then we
have no further news of him. Perhaps there is more
recent information on his file.’</p>

<p class="pindent">General G. nodded. He picked up the receiver of the
telephone nearest to him. This was the so-called <span class="it">Kommandant
Telefon</span> of the MGB. All lines were direct and there
was no central switchboard. He dialled a number. ‘Central
Index? Here General Grubozaboyschikov. The zapiska
of “Bond”—English spy. Emergency.’ He listened
for the immediate ‘At once, Comrade General,’ and put
back the receiver. He looked down the table with
authority. ‘Comrades, from many points of view this spy
sounds an appropriate target. He appears to be a
dangerous enemy of the State. His liquidation will be
of benefit to all departments of our Intelligence apparat.
Is that so?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The conference grunted.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Also his loss will be felt by the Secret Service. But
will it do more? Will it seriously wound them? Will it
help to destroy this myth about which we have been
speaking? Is this man a hero to his organization and
his country?’</p>

<p class="pindent">General Vozdvishensky decided that this question
was intended for him. He spoke up. ‘The English are
not interested in heroes unless they are footballers or
cricketers or jockeys. If a man climbs a mountain or
runs very fast he also is a hero to some people, but not
to the masses. The Queen of England is also a hero,
and Churchill. But the English are not greatly interested
in military heroes. This man Bond is unknown to the
public. If he was known, he would still not be a hero.
In England, neither open war nor secret war is a heroic
matter. They do not like to think about war, and after
a war the names of their war heroes are forgotten as
quickly as possible. Within the Secret Service, this man
may be a local hero or he may not. It will depend on
his appearance and personal characteristics. Of these I
know nothing. He may be fat and greasy and unpleasant.
No one makes a hero out of such a man, however
successful he is.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Nikitin broke in. ‘English spies we have captured speak
highly of this man. He is certainly much admired in his
Service. He is said to be a lone wolf, but a good-looking
one.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The internal office telephone purred softly. General
G. lifted the receiver, listened briefly and said, ‘Bring it
in.’ There was a knock on the door. The ADC came in
carrying a bulky file in cardboard covers. He crossed
the room and placed the file on the desk in front of
the General and walked out, closing the door softly
behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">The file had a shiny black cover. A thick white stripe
ran diagonally across it from top right-hand corner to
bottom left. In the top left-hand space there were the
letters ‘S.S.’ in white, and under them ‘<span class="sc">sovershenno
sekretno</span>’, the equivalent of ‘Top Secret’. Across the
centre was neatly painted in white letters ‘<span class="sc">james bond</span>’,
and underneath ‘<span class="it">Angliski Spion</span>’.</p>

<p class="pindent">General G. opened the file and took out a large
envelope containing photographs which he emptied on
to the glass surface of the desk. He picked them up
one by one. He looked closely at them, sometimes
through a magnifying glass which he took out of a
drawer, and passed them across the desk to Nikitin who
glanced at them and handed them on.</p>

<p class="pindent">The first was dated 1946. It showed a dark young
man sitting at a table outside a sunlit café. There was
a tall glass beside him on the table and a soda-water
siphon. The right forearm rested on the table and there
was a cigarette between the fingers of the right hand
that hung negligently down from the edge of the table.
The legs were crossed in that attitude that only an
Englishman adopts—with the right ankle resting on
the left knee and the left hand grasping the ankle. It
was a careless pose. The man didn’t know that he was
being photographed from a point about twenty feet
away.</p>

<p class="pindent">The next was dated 1950. It was a face and shoulders,
blurred, but of the same man. It was a close-up
and Bond was looking with careful, narrowed eyes at
something, probably the photographer’s face, just
above the lens. A miniature buttonhole camera, guessed
General G.</p>

<p class="pindent">The third was from 1951. Taken from the left flank,
quite close, it showed the same man in a dark suit, without
a hat, walking down a wide empty street. He was passing
a shuttered shop whose sign said ‘Charcuterie’. He looked
as if he was going somewhere urgently. The clean-cut
profile was pointing straight ahead and the crook of the
right elbow suggested that his right hand was in the
pocket of his coat. General G. reflected that it was probably
taken from a car. He thought that the decisive look
of the man, and the purposeful slant of his striding
figure, looked dangerous, as if he was making quickly
for something bad that was happening further down the
street.</p>

<p class="pindent">The fourth and last photograph was marked <span class="it">Passe</span>.
1953. The corner of the Royal Seal and the letters ‘. . .
<span class="sc">reign office</span>’ in the segment of a circle showed in
the bottom right-hand corner. The photograph, which
had been blown up to cabinet size, must have been
made at a frontier, or by the concierge of an hotel when
Bond had surrendered his passport. General G. carefully
went over the face with his magnifying glass.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a dark, clean-cut face, with a three-inch scar
showing whitely down the sun-burned skin of the right
cheek. The eyes were wide and level under straight,
rather long black brows. The hair was black, parted on
the left, and carelessly brushed so that a thick black
comma fell down over the right eyebrow. The longish
straight nose ran down to a short upper lip below which
was a wide and finely drawn but cruel mouth. The line
of the jaw was straight and firm. A section of dark suit,
white shirt and black knitted tie completed the
picture.</p>

<p class="pindent">General G. held the photograph out at arm’s length.
Decision, authority, ruthlessness—these qualities he could
see. He didn’t care what else went on inside the man. He
passed the photograph down the table and turned to the
file, glancing rapidly down each page and flipping
brusquely on to the next.</p>

<p class="pindent">The photographs came back to him. He kept his
place with a finger and looked briefly up. ‘He looks a
nasty customer,’ he said grimly. ‘His story confirms it.
I will read out some extracts. Then we must decide. It
is getting late.’ He turned back to the first page and
began to rattle off the points that struck him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘First name: <span class="sc">james</span>. Height: 183 centimetres, weight:
76 kilograms; slim build; eyes: blue; hair: black; scar
down right cheek and on left shoulder; signs of plastic
surgery on back of right hand (see Appendix “A”); all-round
athlete; expert pistol shot, boxer, knife-thrower;
does not use disguises. Languages: French and German.
Smokes heavily (NB: special cigarettes with three gold
bands); vices: drink, but not to excess, and women. Not
thought to accept bribes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">General G. skipped a page and went on:</p>

<p class="pindent">‘This man is invariably armed with a .25 Beretta automatic
carried in a holster under his left arm. Magazine
holds eight rounds. Has been known to carry a knife
strapped to his left forearm; has used steel-capped
shoes; knows the basic holds of judo. In general, fights
with tenacity and has a high tolerance of pain (see
Appendix “B”).’</p>

<p class="pindent">General G. riffled through more pages giving extracts
from agents’ reports from which this data was drawn.
He came to the last page before the Appendices which
gave details of the cases on which Bond had been
encountered. He ran his eye to the bottom and read
out: ‘Conclusion. This man is a dangerous professional
terrorist and spy. He has worked for the British Secret
Service since 1938 and now (see Highsmith file of
December 1950) holds the secret number “007” in that
Service. The double 0 numerals signify an agent who
has killed and who is privileged to kill on active service.
There are believed to be only two other British agents
with this authority. The fact that this spy was decorated
with the CMG in 1953, an award usually given only on
retirement from the Secret Service, is a measure of his
worth. If encountered in the field, the fact and full
details to be reported to headquarters (see <span class="sc">smersh</span>
MGB and GRU Standing Orders 1951 onwards).’</p>

<p class="pindent">General G. shut the file and slapped his hand decisively
on the cover. ‘Well, Comrades. Are we agreed?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ said Colonel Nikitin, loudly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ said General Slavin in a bored voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">General Vozdvishensky was looking down at his
fingernails. He was sick of murder. He had enjoyed his
time in England. ‘Yes,’ he said. ‘I suppose so.’</p>

<p class="pindent">General G.’s hand went to the internal office telephone.
He spoke to his ADC. ‘Death Warrant,’ he said
harshly. ‘Made out in the name of “James Bond”.’ He
spelled the names out. ‘Description: Angliski Spion.
Crime: Enemy of the State.’ He put the receiver back
and leant forward in his chair. ‘And now it will be a
question of devising an appropriate konspiratsia. And
one that cannot fail!’ He smiled grimly. ‘We cannot have
another of those Khoklov affairs.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The door opened and the ADC came in carrying a
bright yellow sheet of paper. He put it in front of General
G. and went out. General G. ran his eyes down the paper
and wrote the words <span class="it">To be killed. Grubozaboyschikov</span> at the
head of the large empty space at the bottom. He passed
the paper to the MGB man who read it and wrote <span class="it">Kill
him. Nikitin</span> and handed it across to the head of GRU
who wrote <span class="it">Kill him. Slavin.</span> One of the ADCs passed the
paper to the plain-clothes man sitting beside the representative
of RUMID. The man put it in front of General
Vozdvishensky and handed him a pen.</p>

<p class="pindent">General Vozdvishensky read the paper carefully. He
raised his eyes slowly to those of General G. who was
watching him and, without looking down, scribbled the
‘Kill him’ more or less under the other signatures and
scrawled his name after it. Then he took his hands away
from the paper and got to his feet.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If that is all, Comrade General?’ he pushed his chair
back.</p>

<p class="pindent">General G. was pleased. His instincts about this man
had been right. He would have to put a watch on him
and pass on his suspicions to General Serov. ‘One
moment, Comrade General,’ he said. ‘I have something
to add to the warrant’.</p>

<p class="pindent">The paper was handed up to him. He took out his
pen and scratched out what he had written. He wrote
again, speaking the words slowly as he did so.</p>

<p class="pindent"><span class="it">To be killed</span> <span class="sc">with ignominy</span>. <span class="it">Grubozaboyschikov.</span></p>

<p class="pindent">He looked up and smiled pleasantly to the company.
‘Thank you, Comrades. That is all. I shall advise you
of the decision of the Praesidium on our recommendation.
Good night.’</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">When the conference had filed out, General G. rose to
his feet and stretched and gave a loud controlled yawn.
He sat down again at his desk, switched off the wire-recorder
and rang for his ADC. The man came in and
stood beside his desk.</p>

<p class="pindent">General G. handed him the yellow paper. ‘Send this
over to General Serov at once. Find out where Kronsteen
is and have him fetched by car. I don’t care if he’s in
bed. He will have to come. Otdyel II will know where
to find him. And I will see Colonel Klebb in ten
minutes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, Comrade General.’ The man left the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">General G. picked up the VCh receiver and asked
for General Serov. He spoke quietly for five minutes.
At the end he concluded: ‘And I am now about to give
the task to Colonel Klebb and the Planner, Kronsteen.
We will discuss the outlines of a suitable konspiratsia
and they will give me detailed proposals tomorrow. Is
that in order, Comrade General?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ came the quiet voice of General Serov of the
High Praesidium. ‘Kill him. But let it be excellently
accomplished. The Praesidium will ratify the decision
in the morning.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The line went dead. The inter-office telephone rang.
General G. said ‘Yes’ into the receiver and put it back.</p>

<p class="pindent">A moment later the ADC opened the big door and
stood in the entrance. ‘Comrade Colonel Klebb,’ he
announced.</p>

<p class="pindent">A toad-like figure in an olive green uniform which
bore the single red ribbon of the Order of Lenin came
into the room and walked with quick short steps over
to the desk.</p>

<p class="pindent">General G. looked up and waved to the nearest chair
at the conference table. ‘Good evening, Comrade.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The squat face split into a sugary smile. ‘Good
evening, Comrade General.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Head of Otdyel II, the department of <span class="sc">smersh</span>
in charge of Operations and Executions, hitched up
her skirts and sat down.</p>
