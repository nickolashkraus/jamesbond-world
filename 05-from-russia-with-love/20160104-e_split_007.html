<p class="pindent">‘So you would like to work in the Soviet Union, Mister
Grant?’</p>

<p class="pindent">It was half an hour later and the MGB colonel was
bored with the interview. He thought that he had
extracted from this rather unpleasant British soldier
every military detail that could possibly be of interest.
A few polite phrases to repay the man for the rich haul
of secrets his dispatch bags had yielded, and then the
man could go down to the cells and in due course be
shipped off to Vorkuta or some other labour camp.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, I would like to work for you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And what work could you do, Mister Grant? We
have plenty of unskilled labour. We do not need truck-drivers
and,’ the colonel smiled fleetingly, ‘if there is
any boxing to be done we have plenty of men who
can box. Two possible Olympic champions amongst
them, incidentally.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I am an expert at killing people. I do it very well. I
like it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The colonel saw the red flame that flickered for an
instant behind the very pale blue eyes under the sandy
lashes. He thought, the man means it. He’s mad as well
as unpleasant. He looked coldly at Grant, wondering if
it was worthwhile wasting food on him at Vorkuta.
Better perhaps have him shot. Or throw him back into
the British Sector and let his own people worry about
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You don’t believe me,’ said Grant impatiently. This
was the wrong man, the wrong department. ‘Who does
the rough stuff for you here?’ He was certain the
Russians had some sort of a murder squad. Everybody
said so. ‘Let me talk to them. I’ll kill somebody for
them. Anybody they like. Now.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The colonel looked at him sourly. Perhaps he had
better report the matter. ‘Wait here.’ He got up and
went out of the room, leaving the door open. A guard
came and stood in the doorway and watched Grant’s
back, his hand on his pistol.</p>

<p class="pindent">The colonel went into the next room. It was empty.
There were three telephones on the desk. He picked
up the receiver of the MGB direct line to Moscow.
When the military operator answered he said, ‘<span class="sc">smersh</span>’.
When <span class="sc">smersh</span> answered he asked for the Chief of
Operations.</p>

<p class="pindent">Ten minutes later he put the receiver back. What luck!
A simple, constructive solution. Whichever way it went
it would turn out well. If the Englishman succeeded, it
would be splendid. If he failed, it would still cause a lot
of trouble in the Western Sector—trouble for the British
because Grant was their man, trouble with the Germans
because the attempt would frighten a lot of their spies,
trouble with the Americans because they were supplying
most of the funds for the Baumgarten ring and would
now think Baumgarten’s security was no good. Pleased
with himself, the colonel walked back into his office and
sat down again opposite Grant.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You mean what you say?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course I do.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Have you a good memory?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Yes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘In the British Sector there is a German called Dr
Baumgarten. He lives in Flat 5 at No 22 Kurfürstendamn.
Do you know where that is?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Tonight, with your motor cycle, you will be put back
into the British Sector. Your number plates will be
changed. Your people will be on the lookout for you.
You will take an envelope to Dr Baumgarten. It will be
marked to be delivered by hand. In your uniform, and
with this envelope, you will have no difficulty. You will
say that the message is so private that you must see Dr
Baumgarten alone. Then you will kill him.’ The colonel
paused. His eyebrows lifted. ‘Yes?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ said Grant stolidly. ‘And if I do, will you give
me more of this work?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It is possible,’ said the colonel indifferently. ‘First
you must show what you can do. When you have
completed your task and returned to the Soviet Sector,
you may ask for Colonel Boris.’ He rang a bell and a
man in plain clothes came in. The colonel gestured
towards him. ‘This man will give you food. Later he
will give you the envelope and a sharp knife of
American manufacture. It is an excellent weapon. Good
luck.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The colonel reached and picked a rose out of the
bowl and sniffed it luxuriously.</p>

<p class="pindent">Grant got to his feet. ‘Thank you, sir,’ he said warmly.</p>

<p class="pindent">The colonel did not answer or look up from the rose.
Grant followed the man in plain clothes out of the
room.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">The plane roared on across the Heartland of Russia.
They had left behind them the blast furnaces flaming
far away to the east around Stalino and, to the west,
the silver thread of the Dnieper branching away at
Dnepropetrovsk. The splash of light around Kharkov
had marked the frontier of the Ukraine, and the smaller
blaze of the phosphate town of Kursk had come and
gone. Now Grant knew that the solid unbroken blackness
below hid the great central Steppe where the
billions of tons of Russia’s grain were whispering and
ripening in the darkness. There would be no more oases
of light until, in another hour, they would have covered
the last three hundred miles to Moscow.</p>

<p class="pindent">For by now Grant knew a lot about Russia. After the
quick, neat, sensational murder of a vital West German
spy, Grant had no sooner slipped back over the frontier
and somehow fumbled his way to ‘Colonel Boris’ than
he was put into plain clothes, with a flying helmet to
cover his hair, hustled into an empty MGB plane and
flown straight to Moscow.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then began a year of semi-prison which Grant had
devoted to keeping fit and to learning Russian while
people came and went around him—interrogators,
stool-pigeons, doctors. Meanwhile, Soviet spies in
England and Northern Ireland had painstakingly investigated
his past.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the end of the year Grant was given as clean a
bill of political health as any foreigner can get in Russia.
The spies had confirmed his story. The English and
American stool-pigeons reported that he was totally
uninterested in the politics or social customs of any
country in the world, and the doctors and psychologists
agreed that he was an advanced manic depressive whose
periods coincided with the full moon. They added that
Grant was also a narcissist and asexual and that his
tolerance of pain was high. These peculiarities apart,
his physical health was superb and, though his educational
standards were hopelessly low, he was as naturally
cunning as a fox. Everyone agreed that Grant was an
exceedingly dangerous member of society and that he
should be put away.</p>

<p class="pindent">When the dossier came before the Head of Personnel
of the MGB, he was about to write <span class="it">Kill him</span> in the
margin when he had second thoughts.</p>

<p class="pindent">A great deal of killing has to be done in the USSR,
not because the average Russian is a cruel man, although
some of their races are among the cruellest peoples in
the world, but as an instrument of policy. People who
act against the State are enemies of the State, and the
State has no room for enemies. There is too much to
do for precious time to be allotted to them, and, if they
are a persistent nuisance, they get killed. In a country with
a population of 200,000,000, you can kill many thousands
a year without missing them. If, as happened in the
two biggest purges, a million people have to be killed
in one year, that is also not a grave loss. The serious
problem is the shortage of executioners. Executioners
have a short ‘life’. They get tired of the work. The soul
sickens of it. After ten, twenty, a hundred death-rattles,
the human being, however sub-human he may be,
acquires, perhaps by a process of osmosis with death
itself, a germ of death which enters his body and eats
into him like a canker. Melancholy and drink take him,
and a dreadful lassitude which brings a glaze to the
eyes and slows up the movements and destroys accuracy.
When the employer sees these signs he has no alternative
but to execute the executioner and find another
one.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Head of Personnel of the MGB was aware of
the problem and of the constant search not only for
the refined assassin, but also for the common butcher.
And here at last was a man who appeared to be expert
at both forms of killing, dedicated to his craft and indeed,
if the doctors were to be believed, destined for it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Head of Personnel wrote a short, pungent minute
on Grant’s papers, marked them <span class="it">SMERSH Otdyel II</span>
and tossed them into his <span class="sc">out</span> tray.</p>

<p class="pindent">Department 2 of <span class="sc">smersh</span>, in charge of Operations
and Executions, took over the body of Donovan Grant,
changed his name to Granitsky and put him on their
books.</p>

<p class="pindent">The next two years were hard for Grant. He had to
go back to school, and to a school that made him long
for the chipped deal desks in the corrugated-iron shed,
full of the smell of little boys and the hum of drowsy
bluebottles, that had been his only conception of what
a school was like. Now, in the Intelligence School for
Foreigners outside Leningrad, squashed tightly among
the ranks of Germans, Czechs, Poles, Balts, Chinese
and Negroes, all with serious dedicated faces and pens
that raced across their notebooks, he struggled with
subjects that were pure double-dutch to him.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were courses in ‘General Political Knowledge’,
which included the history of Labour movements, of
the Communist Party and the Industrial Forces of the
world, and the teachings of Marx, Lenin and Stalin, all
dotted with foreign names which he could barely spell.
There were lessons on ‘The Class-enemy we are fighting’,
with lectures on Capitalism and Fascism; weeks spent
on ‘Tactics, Agitation and Propaganda’ and more weeks
on the problems of minority peoples, Colonial races,
the Negroes, the Jews. Every month ended with examinations
during which Grant sat and wrote illiterate
nonsense, interspersed with scraps of half-forgotten
English history and misspelled Communist slogans, and
inevitably had his papers torn up, on one occasion, in
front of the whole class.</p>

<p class="pindent">But he stuck it out, and when they came to ‘Technical
Subjects’ he did better. He was quick to understand the
rudiments of Codes and Ciphers, because he wanted to
understand them. He was good at Communications, and
immediately grasped the maze of contacts, cut-outs,
couriers and post-boxes, and he got excellent marks for
Fieldwork in which each student had to plan and operate
dummy assignments in the suburbs and countryside
around Leningrad. Finally, when it came to tests of Vigilance,
Discretion, ‘Safety First’, Presence of Mind,
Courage and Coolness, he got top marks out of the
whole school.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the end of the year, the report that went back to
<span class="sc">smersh</span> concluded ‘Political value Nil. Operational
value Excellent’—which was just what Otdyel II wanted
to hear.</p>

<p class="pindent">The next year was spent, with only two other foreign
students among several hundred Russians, at the School
for Terror and Diversion at Kuchino, outside Moscow.
Here Grant went triumphantly through courses in judo,
boxing, athletics, photography and radio under the
general supervision of the famous Colonel Arkady
Fotoyev, father of the modern Soviet spy, and completed
his small-arms instruction at the hands of Lieutenant-Colonel
Nikolai Godlovsky, the Soviet Rifle Champion.</p>

<p class="pindent">Twice during this year, without warning, an MGB car
came for him on the night of the full moon and took
him to one of the Moscow jails. There, with a black
hood over his head, he was allowed to carry out executions
with various weapons—the rope, the axe, the
sub-machine-gun. Electrocardiograms, blood-pressure
and various other medical tests were applied to him
before, during and after these occasions, but their
purpose and findings were not revealed to him.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a good year and he felt, and rightly, that he
was giving satisfaction.</p>

<p class="pindent">In 1949 and ’50 Grant was allowed to go on minor
operations with Mobile Groups or <span class="it">Avanposts</span>, in the
satellite countries. These were beatings-up and simple
assassinations of Russian spies and intelligence workers
suspected of treachery or other aberrations. Grant
carried out these duties neatly, exactly and inconspicuously,
and though he was carefully and constantly
watched he never showed the smallest deviation from
the standards required of him, and no weaknesses of
character or technical skill. It might have been different
if he had been required to kill when doing a solo task
at the full-moon period, but his superiors, realizing
that at that period he would be outside their control,
or his own, chose safe dates for his operations. The
moon period was reserved exclusively for butchery in
the prisons, and from time to time this was arranged
for him as a reward for a successful operation in cold
blood.</p>

<p class="pindent">In 1951 and ’52 Grant’s usefulness became more fully
and more officially recognized. As a result of excellent
work, notably in the Eastern Sector of Berlin, he was
granted Soviet citizenship and increases in pay which
by 1953 amounted to a handsome 5000 roubles a month.
In 1953 he was given the rank of Major, with pension
rights backdated to the day of his first contact with
Colonel Boris’, and the villa in the Crimea was allotted
to him. Two bodyguards were attached to him, partly
to protect him and partly to guard against the outside
chance of his ‘going private’, as defection is called in
MGB jargon, and, once a month, he was transported
to the nearest jail and allowed as many executions as
there were candidates available.</p>

<p class="pindent">Naturally Grant had no friends. He was hated or
feared or envied by everyone who came in contact with
him. He did not even have any of those professional
acquaintanceships that pass for friendship in the discreet
and careful world of Soviet officialdom. But, if he
noticed the fact, he didn’t care. The only individuals he
was interested in were his victims. The rest of his life
was inside him. And it was richly and excitingly populated
with his thoughts.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then, of course, he had <span class="sc">smersh</span>. No one in the
Soviet Union who has <span class="sc">smersh</span> on his side need worry
about friends, or indeed about anything whatever except
keeping the black wings of <span class="sc">smersh</span> over his head.</p>

<p class="pindent">Grant was still thinking vaguely of how he stood with
his employers when the plane started to lose altitude
as it picked up the radar beam of Tushino Airport just
south of the red glow that was Moscow.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was at the top of his tree, the chief executioner
of <span class="sc">smersh</span>, and therefore of the whole of the Soviet
Union. What could he aim for now? Further promotion?
More money? More gold knick-knacks? More important
targets? Better techniques?</p>

<p class="pindent">There really didn’t seem to be anything more to go for.
Or was there perhaps some other man whom he had
never heard of, in some other country, who would have
to be set aside before absolute supremacy was his?</p>
