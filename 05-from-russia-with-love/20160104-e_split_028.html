<p class="pindent">Hot coffee from the meagre little buffet at Pithion (there
would be no restaurant car until midday), a painless visit
from the Greek customs and passport control, and then
the berths were folded away as the train hurried south
towards the Gulf of Enez at the head of the Aegean.
Outside, there was extra light and colour. The air was
drier. The men at the little stations and in the fields
were handsome. Sunflowers, maize, vines and racks of
tobacco were ripening in the sun. It was, as Darko had
said, another day.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond washed and shaved under the amused eyes of
Tatiana. She approved of the fact that he put no oil on
his hair. ‘It is a dirty habit,’ she said. ‘I was told that
many Europeans have it. We would not think of doing
it in Russia. It dirties the pillows. But it is odd that you
in the West do not use perfume. All our men do.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We wash,’ said Bond dryly.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the heat of her protests, there came a knock on
the door. It was Kerim. Bond let him in. Kerim bowed
towards the girl.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What a charming domestic scene,’ he commented
cheerfully, lowering his bulk into the corner near
the door. ‘I have rarely seen a handsomer pair of
spies.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana glowered at him. ‘I am not accustomed to
Western jokes,’ she said coldly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim’s laugh was disarming. ‘You’ll learn, my dear.
In England, they are great people for jokes. There it is
considered proper to make a joke of everything. I also
have learned to make jokes. They grease the wheels. I
have been laughing a lot this morning. Those poor
fellows at Uzunkopru. I wish I could be there when
the police telephone the German Consulate in Istanbul.
That is the worst of forged passports. They are not
difficult to make, but it is almost impossible to forge
also their birth certificate—the files of the country
which is supposed to have issued them. I fear the careers
of your two comrades have come to a sad end, Mrs
Somerset.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How did you do it?’ Bond knotted his tie.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Money and influence. Five hundred dollars to the
conductor. Some big talk to the police. It was lucky our
friend tried a bribe. A pity that crafty Benz next door,’
he gestured at the wall, ‘didn’t get involved. I couldn’t
do the passport trick twice. We will have to get him some
other way. The man with the boils was easy. He knew
no German and travelling without a ticket is a serious
matter. Ah well, the day has started favourably. We have
won the first round, but our friend next door will now
be very careful. He knows what he has to reckon with.
Perhaps that is for the best. It would have been a nuisance
having to keep you both under cover all day. Now we
can move about—even have lunch together, as long as
you bring the family jewels with you. We must watch to
see if he makes a telephone call at one of the stations.
But I doubt if he could tackle the Greek telephone
exchange. He will probably wait until we are in Yugoslavia.
But there I have my machine. We can get reinforcements
if we need them. It should be a most interesting journey.
There is always excitement on the Orient Express.’ Kerim
got to his feet. He opened the door, ‘And romance.’ He
smiled across the compartment. ‘I will call for you at
lunch-time! Greek food is worse than Turkish, but even
my stomach is in the service of the Queen.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got up and locked the door. Tatiana snapped,
‘Your friend is not kulturny! It is disloyal to refer to
your Queen in that manner.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat down beside her. ‘Tania,’ he said patiently,
‘that is a wonderful man. He is also a good friend. As
far as I am concerned he can say anything he likes. He
is jealous of me. He would like to have a girl like you.
So he teases you. It is a form of flirting. You should
take it as a compliment.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You think so?’ she turned her large blue eyes on his.
‘But what he said about his stomach and the head of
your State. That was being rude to your Queen. It would
be considered very bad manners to say such a thing in
Russia.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They were still arguing when the train ground to a halt
in the sun-baked, fly-swarming station of Alexandropolis.
Bond opened the door into the corridor and the sun
poured in across a pale mirrored sea that married, almost
without horizon, into a sky the colour of the Greek
flag.</p>

<p class="pindent">They had lunch, with the heavy bag under the table
between Bond’s feet. Kerim quickly made friends with
the girl. The MGB man called Benz avoided the
restaurant car. They saw him on the platform buying
sandwiches and beer from a buffet on wheels. Kerim
suggested they ask him to make a four at bridge. Bond
suddenly felt very tired and his tiredness made him feel
that they were turning this dangerous journey into a
picnic. Tatiana noticed his silence. She got up and said
that she must rest. As they went out of the wagon-restaurant
they heard Kerim calling gaily for brandy and
cigars.</p>

<p class="pindent">Back in the compartment, Tatiana said firmly, ‘Now
it is you who will sleep.’ She drew down the blind and
shut out the hard afternoon light and the endless baked
fields of maize and tobacco and wilting sunflowers. The
compartment became a dark green underground cavern.
Bond wedged the doors and gave her his gun and
stretched out with his head in her lap and was immediately
asleep.</p>

<p class="pindent">The long train snaked along the north of Greece
below the foothills of the Rhodope Mountains. Nanthi
came, and Drama, and Serrai, and then they were in
the Macedonian highlands and the line swerved due
south towards Salonica.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was dusk when Bond awoke in the soft cradle of
her lap. At once, as if she had been waiting for the
moment, Tatiana took his face between her hands and
looked down into his eyes and said urgently, ‘<span class="it">Duschka</span>,
how long shall we have this for?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘For long.’ Bond’s thoughts were still luxurious with
sleep.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But for how long?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gazed up into the beautiful, worried eyes. He
cleared the sleep out of his mind. It was impossible
to see beyond the next three days on the train, beyond
their arrival in London. One had to face the fact that
this girl was an enemy agent. His feelings would be of
no interest to the interrogators from his Service and
from the Ministries. Other intelligence services would
also want to know what this girl had to tell them about
the machine she had worked for. Probably at Dover
she would be taken away to ‘The Cage’, that well-sentried
private house near Guildford, where she would
be put in a comfortable, but oh so well-wired room.
And the efficient men in plain clothes would come one
by one and sit and talk with her, and the recorder would
spin in the room below and the records would be
transcribed and sifted for their grains of new fact—and,
of course, for the contradictions they would trap her
into. Perhaps they would introduce a stool-pigeon—a
nice Russian girl who would commiserate with Tatiana
over her treatment and suggest ways of escape, of
turning double, of getting ‘harmless’ information back
to her parents. This might go on for weeks or months.
Meanwhile Bond would be tactfully kept away from
her, unless the interrogators thought he could extract
further secrets by using their feelings for each other.
Then what? The changed name, the offer of a new life
in Canada, the thousand pounds a year she would be
given from the secret funds? And where would he be
when she came out of it all? Perhaps the other side
of the world. Or, if he was still in London, how much of
her feeling for him would have survived the grinding
of the interrogation machine? How much would she
hate or despise the English after going through all this?
And, for the matter of that, how much would have
survived of his own hot flame?</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Duschka</span>,’ repeated Tatiana impatiently. ‘How long?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘As long as possible. It will depend on us. Many people
will interfere. We shall be separated. It will not always
be like this in a little room. In a few days we shall have
to step out into the world. It will not be easy. It would
be foolish to tell you anything else.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana’s face cleared. She smiled down at him. ‘You
are right. I will not ask any more foolish questions. But
we must waste no more of these days.’ She shifted his
head and got up and lay down beside him.</p>

<p class="pindent">An hour later, when Bond was standing in the
corridor, Darko Kerim was suddenly beside him. He
examined Bond’s face. He said slyly, ‘You should not
sleep so long. You have been missing the historic landscape
of northern Greece. And it is time for the <span class="it">premier
service</span>.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All you think about is food,’ said Bond. He gestured
back with his head. ‘What about our friend?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He has not stirred. The conductor has been watching
for me. That man will end up the richest conductor in
the wagon-lit company. Five hundred dollars for Goldfarb’s
papers, and now a hundred dollars a day retainer
until the end of the journey.’ Kerim chuckled. ‘I have
told him he may even get a medal for his services to
Turkey. He believes we are after a smuggling gang.
They’re always using this train for running Turkish
opium to Paris. He is not surprised, only pleased that
he is being paid so well. And now, have you found out
anything more from this Russian princess you have in
there? I still feel disquiet. Everything is too peaceful.
Those two men we left behind may have been quite
innocently bound for Berlin as the girl says. This Benz
may be keeping to his room because he is frightened
of us. All is going well with our journey. And yet, and
yet . . .’ Kerim shook his head. ‘These Russians are great
chess players. When they wish to execute a plot, they
execute it brilliantly. The game is planned minutely, the
gambits of the enemy are provided for. They are foreseen
and countered. At the back of my mind,’ Kerim’s
face in the window was gloomy, ‘I have a feeling that
you and I and this girl are pawns on a very big board—that
we are being allowed our moves because they do
not interfere with the Russian game.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But what is the object of the plot?’ Bond looked out
into the darkness. He spoke to his reflection in the
window. ‘What can they want to achieve? We always get
back to that. Of course we have all smelt a conspiracy
of some sort. And the girl may not even know that
she’s involved in it. I know she’s hiding something, but I
think it’s only some small secret she thinks is unimportant.
She says she’ll tell me everything when we get to
London. Everything? What does she mean? She only
says that I must have faith—that there is no danger.
You must admit, Darko,’ Bond looked up for confirmation
into the slow crafty eyes, ‘that she’s lived up to
her story.’</p>

<p class="pindent">There was no enthusiasm in Kerim’s eyes. He said
nothing.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shrugged. ‘I admit I’ve fallen for her. But I’m
not a fool, Darko. I’ve been watching for any clue,
anything that would help. You know one can tell a lot
when certain barriers are down. Well they are down,
and I know she’s telling the truth. At any rate ninety
per cent of it. And I know she thinks the rest doesn’t
matter. If she’s cheating, she’s also being cheated herself.
On your chess analogy, that is possible. But you still
get back to the question of what it’s all in aid of.’ Bond’s
voice hardened. ‘And, if you want to know, all I ask is
to go on with the game until we find out.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim smiled at the obstinate look on Bond’s face.
He laughed abruptly. ‘If it was me, my friend, I would
slip off the train at Salonica—with the machine, and,
if you like, with the girl also, though that is not so
important. I would take a hired car to Athens and get
on the next plane for London. But I was not brought
up “to be a sport”.’ Kerim put irony into the words.
‘This is not a game to me. It is business. For you it is
different. You are a gambler. M also is a gambler. He
obviously is, or he would not have given you a free hand.
He also wants to know the answer to this riddle. So be
it. But I like to play safe, to make certain, to leave as
little as possible to chance. You think the odds look
right, that they are in your favour?’ Darko Kerim turned
and faced Bond. His voice became insistent. ‘Listen,
my friend,’ he put a huge hand on Bond’s shoulder.
‘This is a billiard table. An easy, flat, green billiard table.
And you have hit your white ball and it is travelling
easily and quietly towards the red. The pocket is alongside.
Fatally, inevitably, you are going to hit the red and
the red is going into that pocket. It is the law of the
billiard table, the law of the billiard room. But, outside
the orbit of these things, a jet pilot has fainted and his
plane is diving straight at that billiard room, or a gas
main is about to explode, or lightning is about to strike.
And the building collapses on top of you and on top
of the billiard table. Then what has happened to that
white ball that could not miss the red ball, and to the
red ball that could not miss the pocket? The white ball
could not miss according to the laws of the billiard
table. But the laws of the billiard table are not the only
laws, and the laws governing the progress of this train,
and of you to your destination, are also not the only
laws in this particular game.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim paused. He dismissed his harangue with a
shrug of the shoulders. ‘You already know these things,
my friend,’ he said apologetically. ‘And I have made
myself thirsty talking platitudes. Hurry the girl up and
we will go and eat. But watch for surprises, I beg of
you.’ He made a cross with his finger over the centre
of his coat. ‘I do not cross my heart. That is being
too serious. But I cross my stomach, which is an
important oath for me. There are surprises on the way
for both of us. The gipsy said to watch out. Now I
say the same. We can play the game on the billiard
table, but we must both be on guard against the world
outside the billiard room. My nose,’ he tapped it, ‘tells
me so.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim’s stomach made an indignant noise like a
forgotten telephone receiver with an angry caller on the
other end. ‘There,’ he said solicitously. ‘What did I say?
We must go and eat.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They finished their dinner as the train pulled into the
hideous modern junction of Thessaloniki. With Bond
carrying the heavy little bag, they went back down the
train and parted for the night. ‘We shall soon be
disturbed again,’ warned Kerim. ‘There is the frontier
at one o’clock. The Greeks will be no trouble, but those
Yugoslavs like waking up anyone who is travelling soft.
If they annoy you, send for me. Even in their country
there are some names I can mention. I am in the second
compartment in the next carriage. I have it to myself.
Tomorrow I will move into our friend Goldfarb’s bed
in No12. For the time being, the first-class is an adequate
stable.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond dozed wakefully as the train laboured up the
moonlit valley of the Vardar towards the instep of
Yugoslavia. Tatiana again slept with her head in his lap.
He thought of what Darko had said. He wondered if
he could not send the big man back to Istanbul when
they had got safely through Belgrade. It was not fair
to drag him across Europe on an adventure that was
outside his territory and with which he had little
sympathy. Darko obviously suspected that Bond had
become infatuated with the girl and wasn’t seeing the
operation straight any more. Well, there was a grain of
truth in that. It would certainly be safer to get off the
train and take another route home. But, Bond admitted
to himself, he couldn’t bear the idea of running away
from this plot, if it was a plot. If it wasn’t, he equally
couldn’t bear the idea of sacrificing the three more
days with Tatiana. And M had left the decision to him.
As Darko had said, M also was curious to see the game
through. Perversely, M too wanted to see what this
whole rigmarole was about. Bond dismissed the
problem. The journey was going well. Once again, why
panic?</p>

<p class="pindent">Ten minutes after they had arrived at the Greek frontier
station of Idomeni there was a hasty knocking on
the door. It woke the girl. Bond slipped from under her
head. He put his ear to the door. ‘Yes?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Le conducteur, Monsieur.</span> There has been an accident.
Your friend Kerim Bey.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Wait,’ said Bond fiercely. He fitted the Beretta into
its holster and put on his coat. He tore open the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What is it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The conductor’s face was yellow under the corridor
light. ‘Come.’ He ran down the corridor towards the
first-class.</p>

<p class="pindent">Officials were clustered round the open door of the
second compartment. They were standing, staring.</p>

<p class="pindent">The conductor made a path for Bond. Bond reached
the door and looked in.</p>

<p class="pindent">The hair stirred softly on his head. Along the right-hand
seat were two bodies. They were frozen in a ghastly
death-struggle that might have been posed for a film.</p>

<p class="pindent">Underneath was Kerim, his knees up in a last effort
to rise. The taped hilt of a dagger protruded from his
neck near the jugular vein. His head was thrust back
and the empty bloodshot eyes stared up at the night.
The mouth was contorted into a snarl. A thin trickle
of blood ran down the chin.</p>

<p class="pindent">Half on top of him sprawled the heavy body of the
MGB man called Benz, locked there by Kerim’s left
arm round his neck. Bond could see a corner of the
Stalin moustache and the side of a blackened face.
Kerim’s right arm lay across the man’s back, almost
casually. The hand ended in a closed fist and the knob
of a knife-hilt, and there was a wide stain on the coat
under the hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond listened to his imagination. It was like watching
a film. The sleeping Darko, the man slipping quietly
through the door, the two steps forward and the swift
stroke at the jugular. Then the last violent spasm of
the dying man as he flung up an arm and clutched his
murderer to him and plunged the knife down towards
the fifth rib.</p>

<p class="pindent">This wonderful man who had carried the sun with
him. Now he was extinguished, totally dead.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned brusquely and walked out of sight of
the man who had died for him.</p>

<p class="pindent">He began, carefully, non-committally, to answer
questions.</p>
