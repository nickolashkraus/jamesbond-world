<p class="pindent">It was the morning of the next day.</p>

<p class="pindent">Colonel Klebb sat at her desk in the roomy office
that was her headquarters in the underground basement
of <span class="sc">smersh</span>. It was more an operations room
than an office. One wall was completely papered with
a map of the Western Hemisphere. The opposite wall
was covered with the Eastern Hemisphere. Behind
her desk and within reach of her left hand, a Telekrypton
occasionally chattered out a signal <span class="it">en clair</span>,
duplicating another machine in the Cipher Department
under the tall radio masts on the roof of the
building. From time to time, when Colonel Klebb
thought of it, she tore off the lengthening strip of
tape and read through the signals. This was a formality.
If anything important happened, her telephone would
ring. Every agent of <span class="sc">smersh</span> throughout the world was
controlled from this room, and it was a vigilant and
iron control.</p>

<p class="pindent">The heavy face looked sullen and dissipated. The
chicken-skin under the eyes was pouched and the whites
of the eyes were veined with red.</p>

<p class="pindent">One of the three telephones at her side purred softly.
She picked up the receiver. ‘Send him in.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She turned to Kronsteen who sat, picking his teeth
thoughtfully with an opened paper-clip, in an armchair
up against the left-hand wall, under the toe of Africa.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Granitsky.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kronsteen slowly turned his head and looked at the
door.</p>

<p class="pindent">Red Grant came in and closed the door softly behind
him. He walked up to the desk and stood looking
down, obediently, almost hungrily, into the eyes of his
Commanding Officer. Kronsteen thought that he looked
like a powerful mastiff, waiting to be fed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Rosa Klebb surveyed him coldly. ‘Are you fit and
ready for work?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, Comrade Colonel.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Let’s have a look at you. Take off your clothes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Red Grant showed no surprise. He took off his coat
and, after looking around for somewhere to put it,
dropped it on the floor. Then, unselfconsciously, he
took off the rest of his clothes and kicked off his shoes.
The great red-brown body with its golden hair lit up
the drab room. Grant stood relaxed, his hands held
loosely at his sides and one knee bent slightly forward,
as if he was posing for an art class.</p>

<p class="pindent">Rosa Klebb got to her feet and came round the desk.
She studied the body minutely, prodding here, feeling
there, as if she was buying a horse. She went behind
the man and continued her minute inspection. Before
she came back in front of him, Kronsteen saw her slip
something out of her jacket pocket and fit it into her
hand. There was a glint of metal.</p>

<p class="pindent">The woman came round and stood close up to the
man’s gleaming stomach, her right arm behind her back.
She held his eyes in hers.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly, with terrific speed and the whole weight
of her shoulder behind the blow, she whipped her right
fist, loaded with a heavy brass knuckle-duster, round
and exactly into the solar plexus of the man.</p>

<p class="pindent"><span class="it">Whuck!</span></p>

<p class="pindent">Grant let out a snort of surprise and pain. His knees
gave slightly, and then straightened. For a flash the eyes
closed tight with agony. Then they opened again and
glared redly down into the cold yellow probing eyes
behind the square glasses. Apart from an angry flush
on the skin just below the breast bone, Grant showed
no ill effects from a blow that would have sent any
normal man writhing to the ground.</p>

<p class="pindent">Rosa Klebb smiled grimly. She slipped the knuckle-duster
back in her pocket and walked to her desk and
sat down. She looked across at Kronsteen with a hint
of pride. ‘At least he is fit enough,’ she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kronsteen grunted.</p>

<p class="pindent">The naked man grinned with sly satisfaction. He
brought up one hand and rubbed his stomach.</p>

<p class="pindent">Rosa Klebb sat back in her chair and watched him
thoughtfully. Finally she said, ‘Comrade Granitsky, there
is work for you. An important task. More important
than anything you have attempted. It is a task that will
earn you a medal’—Grant’s eyes gleamed—‘for the
target is a difficult and dangerous one. You will be in
a foreign country, and alone. Is that clear?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, Comrade Colonel.’ Grant was excited. Here was
a chance for that big step forward. What would the
medal be? The Order of Lenin? He listened carefully.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The target is an English spy. You would like to kill
an English spy?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Very much indeed, Comrade Colonel.’ Grant’s enthusiasm
was genuine. He asked nothing better than to kill
an Englishman. He had accounts to settle with the
bastards.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You will need many weeks of training and preparation.
On this assignment you will be operating in the
guise of an English agent. Your manners and appearance
are uncouth. You will have to learn at least some
of the tricks,’ the voice sneered, ‘of a chentleman. You
will be placed in the hands of a certain Englishman we
have here. A former chentleman of the Foreign Office
in London. It will be his task to make you pass as some
sort of an English spy. They employ many different
kinds of men. It should not be difficult. And you will
have to learn many other things. The operation will be
at the end of August, but you will start your training at
once. There is much to be done. Put on your clothes
and report back to the ADC. Understood?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, Comrade Colonel.’ Grant knew not to ask any
questions. He scrambled into his clothes, indifferent to
the woman’s eyes on him, and walked over to the door,
buttoning his jacket. He turned. ‘Thank you, Comrade
Colonel.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Rosa Klebb was writing up her note of the interview.
She didn’t answer or look up and Grant went out and
closed the door softly behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">The woman threw down her pen and sat back.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And now, Comrade Kronsteen. Are there any points
to discuss before we put the full machinery in motion?
I should mention that the Praesidium has approved the
target and ratified the death warrant. I have reported
the broad lines of your plan to Comrade General
Grubozaboyschikov. He is in agreement. The detailed
execution has been left entirely in my hands. The
combined planning and operations staff has been
selected and is waiting to begin work. Have you any
last minute thoughts, Comrade?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kronsteen sat looking up at the ceiling, the tips of
his fingers joined in front of him. He was indifferent
to the condescension in the woman’s voice. The pulse
of concentration beat in his temples.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘This man Granitsky. He is reliable? You can trust
him in a foreign country? He will not go private?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He has been tested for nearly ten years. He has had
many opportunities to escape. He has been watched for
signs of itching feet. There has never been a breath of
suspicion. The man is in the position of a drug addict.
He would no more abandon the Soviet Union than a
drugger would abandon the source of his cocaine. He
is my top executioner. There is no one better.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And this girl, Romanova. She was satisfactory?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The woman said grudgingly, ‘She is very beautiful. She
will serve our purpose. She is not a virgin, but she is
prudish and sexually unawakened. She will receive instruction.
Her English is excellent. I have given her a certain
version of her task and its object. She is co-operative.
If she should show signs of faltering, I have the addresses
of certain relatives, including children. I shall also have
the names of her previous lovers. If necessary, it would
be explained to her that these people will be hostages
until her task is completed. She has an affectionate nature.
Such a hint would be sufficient. But I do not anticipate
any trouble from her.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Romanova. That is the name of a <span class="it">buivshi</span>—of one of
the former people. It seems odd to be using a Romanov
for such a delicate task.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Her grandparents were distantly related to the
Imperial Family. But she does not frequent buivshi
circles. Anyway, all our grandparents were former
people. There is nothing one can do about it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Our grandparents were not called Romanov,’ said
Kronsteen dryly. ‘However, so long as you are satisfied.’
He reflected a moment. ‘And this man Bond. Have we
discovered his whereabouts?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes. The MGB English network reports him in
London. During the day, he goes to his headquarters.
At night he sleeps in his flat in a district of London
called Chelsea.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That is good. Let us hope he stays there for the next
few weeks. That will mean that he is not engaged on
some operation. He will be available to go after our
bait when they get the scent. Meanwhile,’ Kronsteen’s
dark, pensive eyes continued to examine a particular
point on the ceiling, ‘I have been studying the suitability
of centres abroad. I have decided on Istanbul for the
first contact. We have a good apparat there. The Secret
Service has only a small station. The head of the station
is reported to be a good man. He will be liquidated.
The centre is conveniently placed for us, with short
lines of communication with Bulgaria and the Black
Sea. It is relatively far from London. I am working out
details of the point of assassination and the means of
getting this Bond there, after he has contacted the girl.
It will be either in France or very near it. We have
excellent leverage on the French press. They will make
the most of this kind of story, with its sensational
disclosures of sex and espionage. It also remains to be
decided when Granitsky shall enter the picture. These
are minor details. We must choose the cameramen and
the other operatives and move them quietly into
Istanbul. There must be no crowding of our apparat
there, no congestion, no unusual activity. We will warn
all departments that wireless traffic with Turkey is to
be kept absolutely normal before and during the operation.
We don’t want the British interceptors smelling
a rat. The Cipher Department has agreed that there is
no Security objection to handing over the outer case
of a Spektor machine. That will be attractive. The
machine will go to the Special Devices section. They
will handle its preparation.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kronsteen stopped talking. His gaze slowly came
down from the ceiling. He rose thoughtfully to his feet.
He looked across and into the watchful, intent eyes of
the woman.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I can think of nothing else at the moment, Comrade,’
he said. ‘Many details will come up and have to be settled
from day to day. But I think the operation can safely
begin.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I agree, Comrade. The matter can now go forward. I
will issue the necessary directives.’ The harsh, authoritative
voice unbent. ‘I am grateful for your co-operation.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kronsteen lowered his head one inch in acknowledgment.
He turned and walked softly out of the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the silence, the Telekrypton gave a warning ping
and started up its mechanical chatter. Rosa Klebb stirred
in her chair and reached for one of the telephones. She
dialled a number.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Operations Room,’ said a man’s voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">Rosa Klebb’s pale eyes, gazing out across the room,
lit on the pink shape on the wall-map that was England.
Her wet lips parted.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Colonel Klebb speaking. The konspiratsia against
the English spy Bond. The operation will commence
forthwith.’</p>
