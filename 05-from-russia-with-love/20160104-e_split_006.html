<p class="pindent">Grant put the telephone softly back on its cradle and
sat looking at it.</p>

<p class="pindent">The bullet-headed guard standing over him said, ‘You
had better start moving.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Did they give you any idea of the task?’ Grant spoke
Russian excellently but with a thick accent. He could
have passed for a national of any of the Soviet Baltic
provinces. The voice was high and flat as if it was
reciting something dull from a book.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No. Only that you are wanted in Moscow. The plane
is on its way. It will be here in about an hour. Half an
hour for refuelling and then three or four hours,
depending on whether you come down at Kharkov. You
will be in Moscow by midnight. You had better pack.
I will order the car.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Grant got nervously to his feet. ‘Yes. You are right.
But they didn’t even say if it was an operation? One
likes to know. It was a secure line. They could have
given a hint. They generally do.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘This time they didn’t.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Grant walked slowly out through the glass door on
to the lawn. If he noticed the girl sitting on the far edge
of the pool he made no sign. He bent and picked up
his book, and the golden trophies of his profession,
and walked back into the house and up the few stairs
to his bedroom.</p>

<p class="pindent">The room was bleak and furnished only with an iron
bedstead, from which the rumpled sheets hung down
on one side to the floor, a cane chair, an unpainted
clothes cupboard and a cheap washstand with a tin
basin. The floor was strewn with English and American
magazines. Garish paperbacks and hardcover thrillers
were stacked against the wall below the window.</p>

<p class="pindent">Grant bent down and pulled a battered Italian fibre
suitcase from under the bed. He packed into it a selection
of well-laundered cheap respectable clothes from
the cupboard. Then he washed his body hurriedly with
cold water, and the inevitably rose-scented soap, and
dried himself on one of the sheets from the bed.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was the noise of a car outside. Grant hastily
dressed in clothes as drab and nondescript as those he
had packed, put on his wristwatch, pocketed his other
belongings and picked up his suitcase and went down
the stairs.</p>

<p class="pindent">The front door was open. He could see his two guards
talking to the driver of a battered ZIS saloon. ‘Bloody
fools,’ he thought. (He still did most of his thinking in
English.) ‘Probably telling him to see I get on the plane
all right. Probably can’t imagine that a foreigner would
want to live in their blasted country.’ The cold eyes
sneered as Grant put down his suitcase on the doorstep
and hunted among the bunch of coats that hung from
pegs on the kitchen door. He found his ‘uniform’, the
drab raincoat and black cloth cap of Soviet officialdom,
put them on, picked up his suitcase and went out and
climbed in beside the plain-clothes driver, roughly shouldering
aside one of the guards as he did so.</p>

<p class="pindent">The two men stood back, saying nothing, but looking
at him with hard eyes. The driver took his foot off the
clutch, and the car, already in gear, accelerated fast away
down the dusty road.</p>

<p class="pindent">The villa was on the south-eastern coast of the
Crimea, about half way between Feodosiya and Yalta.
It was one of many official holiday <span class="it">datchas</span> along the
favourite stretch of mountainous coastline that is part
of the Russian Riviera. Red Grant knew that he was
immensely privileged to be housed there instead of in
some dreary villa on the outskirts of Moscow. As the
car climbed up into the mountains, he thought that they
certainly treated him as well as they knew how, even if
their concern for his welfare had two faces.</p>

<p class="pindent">The forty-mile drive to the airport at Simferopol took
an hour. There were no other cars on the road and the
occasional cart from the vineyards quickly pulled into
the ditch at the sound of their horn. As everywhere in
Russia, a car meant an official, and an official could only
mean danger.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were roses all the way, fields of them alternating
with the vineyards, hedges of them along the road and,
at the approach to the airport, a vast circular bed planted
with red and white varieties to make a red star against
a white background. Grant was sick of them and he
longed to get to Moscow and away from their sweet
stench.</p>

<p class="pindent">They drove past the entrance to the Civil Airport
and followed a high wall for about a mile to the military
side of the aerodrome. At a tall wire gate the
driver showed his pass to two tommy-gunned sentries
and drove through on to the tarmac. Several planes
stood about, big camouflaged military transports, small
twin-engined trainers and two Navy helicopters. The
driver stopped to ask a man in overalls where to find
Grant’s plane. At once a metallic twanging came from
the observant control tower and a loudspeaker barked
at them: ‘To the left. Far down to the left. Number
V-BO.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The driver was obediently motoring on across the
tarmac when the iron voice barked again. ‘Stop!’</p>

<p class="pindent">As the driver jammed on his brakes, there sounded
a deafening scream above their heads. Both men instinctively
ducked as a flight of four MIG 17s came out of
the setting sun and skimmed over them, their squat
wind-brakes right down for the landing. The planes hit
the huge runway one after the other, puffs of blue
smoke spurting from their nose-tyres, and, with jets
howling, taxied to the distant boundary line and turned
to come back to the control tower and the hangars.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Proceed!’</p>

<p class="pindent">A hundred yards farther on they came to a plane
with the recognition letters V-BO. It was a two-engined
Ilyushin 12. A small aluminium ladder hung down from
the cabin door and the car stopped beside it. One of
the crew appeared at the door. He came down the
ladder and carefully examined the driver’s pass and
Grant’s identity papers and then waved the driver away
and gestured Grant to follow him up the ladder. He
didn’t offer to help with the suitcase, but Grant carried
it up the ladder as if it had been no heavier than a
book. The crewman pulled the ladder up after him,
banged the wide hatch shut and went forward to the
cockpit.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were twenty empty seats to choose from. Grant
settled into the one nearest the hatch and fastened his
seat-belt. A short crackle of talk with the control tower
came through the open door to the cockpit, the two
engines whined and coughed and fired and the plane
turned quickly as if it had been a motor car, rolled out
to the start of the north-south runway, and, without
any further preliminaries, hurtled down it and up into
the air.</p>

<p class="pindent">Grant unbuckled his seat-belt, lit a gold-tipped Troika
cigarette and settled back to reflect comfortably on his
past career and to consider the immediate future.</p>

<p class="pindent">Donovan Grant was the result of a midnight union
between a German professional weight-lifter and a
Southern Irish waitress. The union lasted for a quarter
of an hour on the damp grass behind a circus tent outside
Belfast. Afterwards the father gave the mother half a
crown and the mother walked happily home to her bed
in the kitchen of a café near the railway station. When
the baby was expected she went to live with an aunt in
the small village of Aughmacloy that straddles the border,
and there, six months later, she died of puerperal fever
shortly after giving birth to a twelve-pound boy. Before
she died, she said that the boy was to be called Donovan
(the weight-lifter had styled himself ‘The Mighty
O’Donovan’) and Grant, which was her own name.</p>

<p class="pindent">The boy was reluctantly cared for by the aunt and
grew up healthy and extremely strong, but very quiet.
He had no friends. He refused to communicate with
other children and when he wanted anything from them
he took it with his fists. In the local school he continued
to be feared and disliked, but he made a name for himself
boxing and wrestling at local fairs where the bloodthirsty
fury of his attack, combined with guile, gave him the
victory over much older and bigger boys.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was through his fighting that he came to the notice
of the Sinn-Feiners who used Aughmacloy as a principal
pipeline for their comings and goings with the north,
and also of the local smugglers who used the village
for the same purpose. When he left school he became
a strongarm man for both these groups. They paid him
well for his work but saw as little of him as they
could.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was about this time that his body began to feel
strange and violent compulsions around the time of
the full moon. When, in October of his sixteenth year,
he first got ‘The Feelings’ as he called them to himself,
he went out and strangled a cat. This made him ‘feel
better’ for a whole month. In November, it was a big
sheepdog, and, for Christmas, he slit the throat of a
cow, at midnight in a neighbour’s shed. These actions
made him ‘feel good’. He had enough sense to see
that the village would soon start wondering about the
mysterious deaths, so he bought a bicycle and on one
night every month he rode off into the countryside.
Often he had to go very far to find what he wanted
and, after two months of having to satisfy himself
with geese and chickens, he took a chance and cut the
throat of a sleeping tramp.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were so few people abroad at night that soon
he took to the roads earlier, bicycling far and wide so
that he came to distant villages in the dusk when solitary
people were coming home from the fields and girls
were going out to their trysts.</p>

<p class="pindent">When he killed the occasional girl he did not ‘interfere’
with her in any way. That side of things, which he
had heard talked about, was quite incomprehensible to
him. It was only the wonderful act of killing that made
him ‘feel better’. Nothing else.</p>

<p class="pindent">By the end of his seventeenth year, ghastly rumours
were spreading round the whole of Fermanagh, Tyrone
and Armagh. When a woman was killed in broad
daylight, strangled and thrust carelessly into a haystack,
the rumours flared into panic. Groups of vigilantes
were formed in the villages, police reinforcements were
brought in with police dogs, and stories about the
‘Moon Killer’ brought journalists to the area. Several
times Grant on his bicycle was stopped and questioned,
but he had powerful protection in Aughmacloy and
his story of training-spins to keep him fit for his
boxing were always backed up, for he was now the
pride of the village and contender for the North of
Ireland light-heavyweight championship.</p>

<p class="pindent">Again, before it was too late, instinct saved him from
discovery and he left Aughmacloy and went to Belfast
and put himself in the hands of a broken-down boxing
promoter who wanted him to turn professional. Discipline
in the sleazy gymnasium was strict. It was almost
a prison and, when the blood first boiled again in Grant’s
veins, there was nothing for it but to half kill one of
his sparring partners. After twice having to be pulled
off a man in the ring, it was only by winning the
championship that he was saved from being thrown out
by the promoter.</p>

<p class="pindent">Grant won the championship in 1945, on his eighteenth
birthday, then they took him for National Service and
he became a driver in the Royal Corps of Signals. The
training period in England sobered him, or at least made
him more careful when he had ‘The Feelings’. Now, at
the full moon, he took to drink instead. He would take
a bottle of whisky into the woods round Aldershot and
drink it all down as he watched his sensations, coldly,
until unconsciousness came. Then, in the early hours
of the morning, he would stagger back to camp, only
half satisfied, but not dangerous any more. If a sentry
caught him, it was only a day’s CB, because his
commanding officer wanted to keep him happy for the
Army championships.</p>

<p class="pindent">But Grant’s transport section was rushed to Berlin
about the time of the Corridor trouble with the Russians
and he missed the championships. In Berlin, the constant
smell of danger intrigued him and made him even more
careful and cunning. He still got dead drunk at the full
moon, but all the rest of the time he was watching and
plotting. He liked all he heard about the Russians, their
brutality, their carelessness of human life, and their guile,
and he decided to go over to them. But how? What
could he bring them as a gift? What did they want?</p>

<p class="pindent">It was the BAOR championships that finally told
him to go over. By chance they took place on a night
of the full moon. Grant, fighting for the Royal Corps,
was warned for holding and hitting low and was
disqualified in the third round for persistent foul fighting.
The whole stadium hissed him as he left the ring—the
loudest demonstration came from his own regiment—and
the next morning the commanding officer sent for
him and coldly said he was a disgrace to the Royal Corps
and would be sent home with the next draft. His fellow
drivers sent him to Coventry and, since no one would
drive transport with him, he had to be transferred to
the coveted motor cycle dispatch service.</p>

<p class="pindent">The transfer could not have suited Grant better. He
waited a few days and then, one evening when he had
collected the day’s outgoing mail from the Military Intelligence
Headquarters on the Reichskanzlerplatz, he
made straight for the Russian Sector, waited with his
engine running until the British control gate was opened
to allow a taxi through, and then tore through the closing
gate at forty and skidded to a stop beside the concrete
pillbox of the Russian Frontier post.</p>

<p class="pindent">They hauled him roughly into the guardroom. A
wooden-faced officer behind a desk asked him what he
wanted.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I want the Soviet Secret Service,’ said Grant flatly.
‘The Head of it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The officer stared coldly at him. He said something
in Russian. The soldiers who had brought Grant in
started to drag him out again. Grant easily shook them
off. One of them lifted his tommy-gun.</p>

<p class="pindent">Grant said, speaking patiently and distinctly, ‘I have
a lot of secret papers. Outside. In the leather bags on
the motor cycle.’ He had a brainwave. ‘You will get into
bad trouble if they don’t get to your Secret Service.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The officer said something to the soldiers and they
stood back. ‘We have no Secret Service,’ he said in stilted
English. ‘Sit down and complete this form.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Grant sat down at the desk and filled in a long form
which asked questions about anyone who wanted to
visit the Eastern zone—name, address, nature of business
and so forth. Meanwhile the officer spoke softly
and briefly into a telephone.</p>

<p class="pindent">By the time Grant had finished, two more soldiers,
non-commissioned officers wearing drab green forage
caps and with green badges of rank on their khaki
uniforms, had come into the room. The frontier officer
handed the form, without looking at it, to one of them
and they took Grant out and put him and his motor
cycle into the back of a closed van and locked the door
on him. After a fast drive lasting a quarter of an hour
the van stopped, and when Grant got out he found
himself in the courtyard behind a large new building.
He was taken into the building and up in a lift and left
alone in a cell without windows. It contained nothing
but one iron bench. After an hour, during which, he
supposed, they went through the secret papers, he was
led into a comfortable office in which an officer with
three rows of decorations and the gold tabs of a full
colonel was sitting behind a desk.</p>

<p class="pindent">The desk was bare except for a bowl of roses.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">Ten years later, Grant, looking out of the window of
the plane at a wide cluster of lights twenty thousand
feet below, which he guessed was Kharkov, grinned
mirthlessly at his reflection in the Perspex window.</p>

<p class="pindent">Roses. From that moment his life had been nothing
but roses. Roses, roses, all the way.</p>
