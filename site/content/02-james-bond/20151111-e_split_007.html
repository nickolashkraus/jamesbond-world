<p class="pindent">At the bus stop at the corner of Fifth and Cathedral
Parkway three negroes stood quietly under the light of
a street lamp. They looked wet and bored. They were.
They had been watching the traffic on Fifth since the
call went out at four-thirty.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yo next, Fatso,’ said one of them as the bus came
up out of the rain and stopped with a sigh from the
great vacuum brakes.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ahm tahd,’ said the thick-set man in the mackintosh.
But he pulled his hat down over his eyes and climbed
aboard, slotted his coins and moved down the bus, scanning
the occupants. He blinked as he saw the two white
men, walked on and took the seat directly behind them.</p>

<p class="pindent">He examined the backs of their necks, their coats and
hats and profiles. Bond sat next to the window. The
negro saw the reflection of his scar in the dark glass.</p>

<p class="pindent">He got up and moved to the front of the bus without
looking back. At the next stop he got off the bus and
made straight for the nearest drugstore. He shut himself
into the paybox.</p>

<p class="pindent">Whisper questioned him urgently, then broke the
connection.</p>

<p class="pindent">He plugged in on the right of the board.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes?’ said the deep voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Boss, one of them’s just come in on Fifth. The Limey
with the scar. Got a friend with him, but he don’t seem
to fit the dope on the other two.’ Whisper passed on
an accurate description of Leiter. ‘Coming north, both
of them,’ he gave the number and probable timing of
the bus.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a pause.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Right,’ said the quiet voice. ‘Call off all Eyes on the
other avenues. Warn the night spots that one of them’s
inside and get this to Tee-Hee Johnson, McThing,
Blabbermouth Foley, Sam Miami and The Flannel . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">The voice spoke for five minutes.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Got that? Repeat.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, Sir, Boss,’ said The Whisper. He glanced at his
shorthand pad and whispered fluently and without a
pause into the mouthpiece.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Right.’ The line went dead.</p>

<p class="pindent">His eyes bright, The Whisper took up a fistful of
plugs and started talking to the town.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">From the moment that Bond and Leiter walked under
the canopy of Sugar Ray’s on Seventh Avenue at 123rd
Street there was a team of men and women watching
them or waiting to watch them, speaking softly to The
Whisper at the big switchboard on the Riverside
Exchange, handing them on towards the rendezvous.
In a world where they were naturally the focus of attention,
neither Bond nor Leiter felt the hidden machine
nor sensed the tension around them.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the famous night spot the stools against the long
bar were crowded, but one of the small booths against
the wall was empty and Bond and Leiter slipped into
the two seats with the narrow table between them.</p>

<p class="pindent">They ordered scotch-and-soda—Haig and Haig
Pinchbottle. Bond looked the crowd over. It was nearly
all men. There were two or three whites, boxing fans
or reporters for the New York sports columns, Bond
decided. The atmosphere was warmer, louder than
downtown. The walls were covered with boxing photographs,
mostly of Sugar Ray Robinson and of scenes
from his great fights. It was a cheerful place, doing great
business.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He was a wise guy, Sugar Ray,’ said Leiter. ‘Let’s hope
we both know when to stop when the time comes. He
stashed plenty away and now he’s adding to his pile on
the music halls. His percentage of this place must be
worth a packet and he owns a lot of real estate around
here. He works hard still, but it’s not the sort of work
that sends you blind or gives you a haemorrhage of the
brain. He quit while he was still alive.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He’ll probably back a Broadway show and lose it all,’
said Bond. ‘If I quit now and went in for fruit-farming
in Kent, I’d most likely hit the worst weather since the
Thames froze over, and be cleaned out. One can’t plan
for everything.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘One can try,’ said Leiter. ‘But I know what you mean—better
the frying-pan you know than the fire you don’t.
It isn’t a bad life when it consists of sitting in a comfortable
bar drinking good whisky. How do you like this
corner of the jungle?’ He leant forward. ‘Just listen in
to the couple behind you. From what I’ve heard they’re
straight out of “Nigger Heaven”.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond glanced carefully over his shoulder.</p>

<p class="pindent">The booth behind him contained a handsome young
negro in an expensive fawn suit with exaggerated shoulders.
He was lolling back against the wall with one foot
up on the bench beside him. He was paring the nails of
his left hand with a small silver pocket-knife, occasionally
glancing in bored fashion towards the animation at the
bar. His head rested on the back of the booth just behind
Bond and a whiff of expensive hair-straightener came
from him. Bond took in the artificial parting traced with
a razor across the left side of the scalp, through the almost
straight hair which was a tribute to his mother’s constant
application of the hot comb since childhood. The plain
black silk tie and the white shirt were in good taste.</p>

<p class="pindent">Opposite him, leaning forward with concern on her
pretty face, was a sexy little negress with a touch of
white blood in her. Her jet-black hair, as sleek as the
best permanent wave, framed a sweet almond-shaped
face with rather slanting eyes under finely drawn
eyebrows. The deep purple of her parted, sensual lips
was thrilling against the bronze skin. All that Bond
could see of her clothes was the bodice of a black satin
evening dress, tight and revealing across the firm, small
breasts. She wore a plain gold chain round her neck
and a plain gold band round each thin wrist.</p>

<p class="pindent">She was pleading anxiously and paid no heed to
Bond’s quick embracing glance.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Listen and see if you can get the hang of it,’ said
Leiter. ‘It’s straight Harlem—Deep South with a lot of
New York thrown in.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond picked up the menu and leant back in the booth,
studying the Special Fried Chicken Dinner at $3.75.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Cmon, honey,’ wheedled the girl. ‘How come yuh-all’s
actin’ so tahd tonight?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Guess ah jist nacherlly gits tahd listenin’ at yuh,’ said
the man languidly. ‘Why’nt yuh hush yo’ mouff’n let me
’joy mahself ’n peace ’n qui-yet.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Is yuh wan’ me tuh go ’way, honey?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yuh kin suit yo sweet self.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Aw, honey,’ pleaded the girl. ‘Don’ ack mad at me,
honey. Ah was fixin’ tuh treat yuh tonight. Take yuh
tuh Smalls Par’dise, mebbe. See dem high-yallers shakin’
’n truckin’. Dat Birdie Johnson, da maître d’, he permis
me a ringside whenebber Ah come nex’.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The man’s voice suddenly sharpened. ‘Wha’ dat Birdie
he mean tuh yuh, hey?’ he asked suspiciously. ‘Perzackly,’
he paused to let the big word sink in, ‘perzackly wha’
goes ’tween yuh ’n dat lowdown ornery wuthless
Nigguh? Yuh sleepin’ wid him mebbe? Guess Ah gotta
study ’bout dat little situayshun ’tween yuh an’ Birdie
Johnson. Mebbe git mahself a betterer gal. Ah jist don’
lak gals which runs off ever’ which way when Ah jist
happen be busticated temporaneously. Yesmam. Ah
gotta study ’bout dat little situayshun.’ He paused threateningly.
‘Sure have,’ he added.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Aw, honey,’ the girl was anxious, ‘dey ain’t no use
tryin’ tuh git mad at me. Ah done nuthen tuh give yuh
recasion tuh ack dat way. Ah jist thunk you mebbe
preshiate a ringside at da Par’dise ’nstead of settin’ hyah
countin’ yo troubles. Why, honey, yuh all knows Ah
wudden fall fo’ dat richcrat ack’ of Birdie Johnson. No
sir. He don’ mean nuthen tuh me. Him duh wusstes’
man ’n Harlem, dawg bite me effn he ain’t. All da same,
he permis me da bestess seats ’nda house ’n Ah sez
let’s us go set ’n dem, ’n have us a beer ’n a good time.
Cmon, honey. Let’s git out of hyah. Yuh done look so
swell ’n Ah jist wan’ mah frens tuh see usn together.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yuh done look okay yoself, honeychile,’ said the man,
mollified by the tribute to his elegance, ‘an’ dat’s da
troof. But Ah mus’ spressify dat yuh stays close up tuh
me an keeps yo eyes off’n dat lowdown trash ’n his hot
pants. ’N Ah may say,’ he added threateningly, ‘dat ef
Ah ketches yuh makin’ up tuh dat dope Ah’ll jist nachrally
whup da hide off’n yo sweet ass.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Shoh ting, honey,’ whispered the girl excitedly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond heard the man’s foot scrape off the seat to the
ground.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Cmon, baby, lessgo. Waiduh!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond put down the menu. ‘Got the gist of it,’ he
said. ‘Seems they’re interested in much the same things
as everyone else—sex, having fun, and keeping up with
the Joneses. Thank God they’re not genteel about it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Some of them are,’ said Leiter. ‘Tea-cups, aspidistras
and tut-tutting all over the place. The Methodists are
almost their strongest sect. Harlem’s riddled with social
distinctions, the same as any other big city, but with all
the colour variations added. Come on,’ he suggested,
‘let’s go and get ourselves something to eat.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They finished their drinks and Bond called for the
check.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All this evening’s on me,’ he said. ‘I’ve got a lot of
money to get rid of and I’ve brought three hundred
dollars of it along with me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Suits me,’ said Leiter, who knew about Bond’s thousand
dollars.</p>

<p class="pindent">As the waiter was picking up the change, Leiter
suddenly said, ‘Know where The Big Man’s operating
tonight?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The waiter showed the whites of his eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">He leant forward and flicked the table down with his
napkin.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ve got a wife’n kids, Boss,’ he muttered out of the
corner of his mouth. He stacked the glasses on his tray
and went back to the bar.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mr Big’s got the best protection of all,’ said Leiter.
‘Fear.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They went out on to Seventh Avenue. The rain had
stopped, but ‘Hawkins’, the bone-chilling wind from
the north which the negroes greet with a reverent
‘Hawkins is here’, had come instead to keep the streets
free of their usual crowds. Leiter and Bond moved
with the trickle of couples on the sidewalk. The looks
they got were mostly contemptuous or frankly hostile.
One or two men spat in the gutter when they had
passed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond suddenly felt the force of what Leiter had told
him. They were trespassing. They just weren’t wanted.
Bond felt the uneasiness that he had known so well
during the war, when he had been working for a time
behind the enemy lines. He shrugged the feeling away.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We’ll go to Ma Frazier’s, further up the Avenue,’
said Leiter. ‘Best food in Harlem, or at any rate it used
to be.’</p>

<p class="pindent">As they went along Bond gazed into the shop
windows.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was struck by the number of barbers’ saloons
and ‘beauticians’. They all advertised various forms of
hair-straightener—‘Apex Glossatina, for use with the
hot comb’, ‘Silky Strate. Leaves no redness, no burn’—or
nostrums for bleaching the skin. Next in frequency
were the haberdashers and clothes shops, with fantastic
men’s snakeskin shoes, shirts with small aeroplanes as
a pattern, peg-top trousers with inch-wide stripes, zoot
suits. All the book shops were full of educational literature—how
to learn this, how to do that—and comics.
There were several shops devoted to lucky charms and
various occultisms—<span class="it">Seven Keys to Power</span>, ‘The Strangest
book ever written’, with sub-titles such as: ‘If you are
CROSSED, shows you how to remove and cast it back.’
‘Chant your desires in the Silent Tongue.’ ‘Cast a spell
on anyone, no matter where.’ ‘Make any person love
you.’ Among the charms were ‘High John the Conqueror
Root’, ‘Money Drawing Brand Oil’, ‘Sachet Powders,
Uncrossing Brand’, ‘Incense, Jinx Removing Brand’,
and the ‘Lucky Whamie Hand Charm, Giving Protection
from Evil. Confuses and Baffles Enemies’.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond reflected it was no wonder that the Big Man
found Voodooism such a powerful weapon on minds
that still recoiled at a white chicken’s feather or crossed
sticks in the road—right in the middle of the shining
capital city of the Western world.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m glad we came up here,’ said Bond. ‘I’m beginning
to get the hang of Mr Big. One just doesn’t catch the
smell of all this in a country like England. We’re a
superstitious lot there of course—particularly the Celts—but
here one can almost hear the drums.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter grunted. ‘I’ll be glad to get back to my bed,’
he said. ‘But we need to size up this guy before we
decide how to get at him.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Ma Frazier’s was a cheerful contrast to the bitter streets.
They had an excellent meal of Little Neck Clams and
Fried Chicken Maryland with bacon and sweet corn.
‘We’ve got to have it,’ said Leiter. ‘It’s the national dish.’</p>

<p class="pindent">It was very civilized in the warm restaurant. Their
waiter seemed glad to see them and pointed out various
celebrities, but when Leiter slipped in a question about
Mr Big the waiter seemed not to hear. He kept away
from them until they called for their bill.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter repeated the question.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sorry, Sah,’ said the waiter briefly. ‘Ah cain’t recall a
gemmun of dat name.’</p>

<p class="pindent">By the time they left the restaurant it was ten-thirty
and the Avenue was almost deserted. They took a cab
to the Savoy Ballroom, had a scotch-and-soda, and
watched the dancers.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Most modern dances were invented here,’ said Leiter.
‘That’s how good it is. The Lindy Hop, Truckin’, the
Susie Q, the Shag. All started on that floor. Every big
American band you’ve ever heard of is proud that it
once played here—Duke Ellington, Louis Armstrong,
Cab Calloway, Noble Sissle, Fletcher Henderson. It’s
the Mecca of jazz and jive.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They had a table near the rail round the huge floor.
Bond was spellbound. He found many of the girls very
beautiful. The music hammered its way into his pulse
until he almost forgot what he was there for.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Gets you, doesn’t it?’ said Leiter at last. ‘I could stay
here all night. Better move along. We’ll miss out Small’s
Paradise. Much the same as this, but not quite in the
same class. Think I’ll take you to “Yeah Man”, back on
Seventh. After that we must get moving to one of Mr
Big’s own joints. Trouble is, they don’t open till midnight.
I’ll pay a visit to the washroom while you get the check.
See if I can get a line on where we’re likely to find him
tonight. We don’t want to have to go to all his places.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond paid the check and met Leiter downstairs in
the narrow entrance hall.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter drew him outside and they walked up the street
looking for a cab.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Cost me twenty bucks,’ said Leiter, ‘but the word is
he’ll be at The Boneyard. Small place on Lenox Avenue.
Quite close to his headquarters. Hottest strip in town.
Girl called G-G Sumatra. We’ll have another drink at
“Yeah Man” and hear the piano. Move on at about
twelve-thirty.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The big switchboard, now only a few blocks away, was
almost quiet. The two men had been checked in and out
of Sugar Ray’s, Ma Frazier’s and the Savoy Ballroom.
Midnight had them entering Yeah Man. At twelve-thirty
the final call came and then the board was silent.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Big spoke on the house-phone. First to the head
waiter.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Two white men coming in in five minutes. Give them
the Z table.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, Sir, Boss,’ said the head waiter. He hurried across
the dance-floor to a table away on the right, obscured
from most of the room by a wide pillar. It was next to
the Service entrance but with a good view of the floor
and the band opposite.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was occupied by a party of four, two men and two
girls.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sorry folks,’ said the head waiter. ‘Been a mistake.
Table’s reserved. Newspaper men from downtown.’</p>

<p class="pindent">One of the men began to argue.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Move, Bud,’ said the head waiter crisply. ‘Lofty, show
these folks to table F. Drinks is on the house. Sam,’ he
beckoned to another waiter, ‘clear the table. Two covers.’
The party of four moved docilely away, mollified by
the prospect of free liquor. The head waiter put a
<span class="calibre4">RESERVED</span> sign on table Z, surveyed it and returned to
his post at his table-plan on the high desk beside the
curtained entrance.</p>

<p class="pindent">Meanwhile Mr Big had made two more calls on the
house-phone. One to the Master of Ceremonies.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Lights out at the end of G-G’s act.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, Sir, Boss,’ said the MC with alacrity.</p>

<p class="pindent">The other call was to four men who were playing craps
in the basement. It was a long call, and very detailed.</p>
