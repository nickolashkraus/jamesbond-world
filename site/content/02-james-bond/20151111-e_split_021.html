<p class="pindent">Bond was carried straight to the bottom by the weight
of the limpet mine that he had secured to his chest
with tapes and by the leaded belt which he wore round
his waist to correct the buoyancy of the compressed-air
cylinders.</p>

<p class="pindent">He didn’t pause for an instant but immediately
streaked across the first fifty yards of open sand in a
fast crawl, his face just above the sand. The long webbed
feet would almost have doubled his normal speed if he
had not been hampered by the weight he was carrying
and by the light harpoon gun in his left hand, but he
travelled fast and in under a minute he came to rest in
the shadow of a mass of sprawling coral.</p>

<p class="pindent">He paused and examined his sensations.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was warm in the rubber suit, warmer than he
would have been swimming in the sunshine. He found
his movements very easy and breathing perfectly simple
so long as his breath was even and relaxed. He watched
the tell-tale bubbles streaming up against the coral in a
fountain of silver pearls and prayed that the small waves
were hiding them.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the open he had been able to see perfectly. The
light was soft and milky but not strong enough to melt
the mackerel shadows of the surface waves that
chequered the sand. Now, up against the reef, there was
no reflection from the bottom, and the shadows under
the rocks were black and impenetrable.</p>

<p class="pindent">He risked a quick glance with his pencil torch and
immediately the underbelly of the mass of brown tree-coral
came alive. Anemones with crimson centres waved
their velvet tentacles at him, a colony of black sea-eggs
moved their toledo-steel spines in sudden alarm and a
hairy sea-centipede halted in its hundred strides and
questioned with its eyeless head. In the sand at the base
of the tree a toad-fish softly drew its hideous warty
head back into its funnel and a number of flower-like
sea-worms whisked out of sight down their gelatinous
tubes. A covey of bejewelled butterfly and angel fish
flirted into the light and he marked the flat spiral of a
Long-spined Star Shell.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond tucked the light back in his belt.</p>

<p class="pindent">Above him the surface of the sea was a canopy of
quicksilver. It crackled softly like fat frying in a saucepan.
Ahead the moonlight glinted down into the deep
crooked valley that sloped down and away on the route
he had to follow. He left his sheltering tree of coral
and walked softly forward. Now it was not so easy. The
light was tricky and bad and the petrified forest of the
coral reef was full of culs-de-sac and tempting but
misleading avenues.</p>

<p class="pindent">Sometimes he had to climb almost to the surface
to get over a tangled scrub of tree- and antler-coral
and when this happened he profited by it to check
his position with the moon that glowed like a huge
pale rocket-burst through the broken water. Sometimes
the hourglass waist of a niggerhead gave him
shelter and he rested for a few moments knowing
that the small froth of his air-bubbles would be hidden
by the jagged knob protruding above the surface.
Then he would focus his eyes on the phosphorescent
scribbles of the minute underwater night-life and
perceive whole colonies and populations about their
microscopic business.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were no big fish about, but many lobsters were
out of their holes looking huge and prehistoric in the
magnifying lens of the water. Their stalk-like eyes glared
redly at him and their foot-long spined antennae asked
him for the password. Occasionally they scuttled
nervously backwards into their shelters, their powerful
tails kicking up the sand, and crouched on the tips of
their eight hairy feet, waiting for the danger to pass.
Once the great streamers of a Portuguese man-of-war
floated slowly by. They almost reached his head from
the surface, fifteen feet away, and he remembered the
whiplash of a sting from the contact of one of their
tendrils that had burned for three of his days at Manatee
Bay. If they caught a man across the heart they could
kill him. He saw several green and speckled moray eels,
the latter moving like big yellow and black snakes along
patches of sand, the green ones baring their teeth from
some hole in the rock, and several West Indian blowfish,
like brown owls with huge soft green eyes. He poked
at one with the end of his gun and it swelled out to
the size of a football and became a mass of dangerous
white spines. Wide sea fans swayed and beckoned in
the eddies, and in the grey valleys they caught the light
of the moon and waved spectrally, like fragments of
the shrouds of men buried at sea. Often in the shadows
there were unexplained, heavy movements and swirls
in the water and the sudden glare of large eyes at once
extinguished. Then Bond would whirl round, thumbing
up the safety-catch on his harpoon gun, and stare back
into the darkness. But he shot at nothing and nothing
attacked him as he scrambled and slithered through the
reef.</p>

<p class="pindent">The hundred yards of coral took him a quarter of
an hour. When he got through and rested on a round
lump of brain-coral under the shelter of a last niggerhead,
he was glad that nothing but a hundred yards of
grey-white water lay in front of him. He still felt
perfectly fresh and the elation and clarity of mind
produced by the benzedrine were still with him, but the
gauntlet of hazards through the reef had been a
constant fret, with the risk of tearing his rubber skin
always on his mind. Now the forest of razor-blade coral
was behind, to be exchanged for shark and barracuda
or perhaps a sudden stick of dynamite dropped into
the centre of the little flower of his bubbles on the
surface.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was while he was measuring the dangers ahead that
the octopus got him. Round both ankles.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had been sitting with his feet on the sand and
suddenly they were manacled to the base of the round
toadstool of coral on which he was resting. Even as he
realized what had happened a tentacle began to snake
up his leg and another one, purple in the dim light,
wandered down his webbed left foot.</p>

<p class="pindent">He gave a start of fear and disgust and at once he
was on his feet, shuffling and straining to get away. But
there was no inch of yield and his movements only
gave the octopus an opportunity to pull his heels tighter
under the overhang of the round rock. The strength
of the brute was prodigious and Bond could feel his
balance going fast. In a moment he would be pulled
down flat on his face and then, hampered by the mine
on his chest and the cylinders on his back, it might be
almost impossible to get at the beast.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond snatched his dagger out of his belt and jabbed
down between his legs. But the overhang of the rock
impeded him and he was terrified of cutting his rubber
skin. Suddenly he was toppled over, lying on the sand.
At once his feet began to be drawn into a wide lateral
cleft under the rock. He scrabbled at the sand and tried
to curl round to get within range with the dagger. But
the thick hump of the mine protruding from his chest
prevented him. On the edge of panic, he remembered
the harpoon gun. Before, he had dismissed it as being
a hopeless weapon at that short range, but now it was
the only chance. It lay on the sand where he had left
it. He reached for it and put up the safety-catch. The
mine prevented him from aiming. He slid the barrel
along his legs and probed each of his feet with the tip
of the harpoon to find the gap between them. At once
a tentacle seized the steel tip and began tugging. The
gun slipped between his manacled feet and he pulled
the trigger blindly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Immediately a great cloud of viscous, stringy ink
rolled out of the cleft towards his face. But one leg was
free and then the other and he whipped them round
and under him and seized the haft of the three-foot
harpoon where it disappeared under the rock. He pulled
and strained until, with a rending of flesh, it came away
from the black fog that hung over the hole. Panting, he
got up and stood away from the rock, the sweat pouring
down his face under the mask. Above him, the tell-tale
stream of silver bubbles rose straight to the surface and
he cursed the wounded ‘pusfeller’ in its lair.</p>

<p class="pindent">But there was no time to worry further with it and
he reloaded his gun and struck out with the moon over
his right shoulder.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now he made good going through the misty grey
water and he concentrated only on keeping his face a
few inches above the sand and his head well down to
streamline his body. Once, out of the corner of his eye,
he saw a stingray as big as a ping-pong table shuffle out
of his path, the tips of its great speckled wings beating
like a bird’s, its long horned tail streaming out behind
it. But he paid it no attention, remembering that Quarrel
had said that rays never attack except in self-defence.
He reflected that it had probably come in over the outer
reef to lay its eggs, or ‘Mermaids’ Purses’ as the
fishermen call them, because they are shaped like a
pillow with a stiff black string at each corner, on the
sheltered sandy bottom.</p>

<p class="pindent">Many shadows of big fish lazed across the moonlit
sand, some as long as himself. When one followed
beside him for at least a minute he looked up to see
the white belly of a shark ten feet above him like a
glaucous tapering airship. Its blunt nose was buried
inquisitively in his stream of air-bubbles. The wide sickle
slit of its mouth looked like a puckered scar. It leant
sideways and glanced down at him out of one hard
pink naked eye, then it wobbled its great scythe-shaped
tail and moved slowly into the wall of grey mist.</p>

<p class="pindent">He frightened a family of squids, ranging from about
six pounds down to an infant of six ounces, frail and
luminous in the half-light, hanging almost vertical in a
diminishing chorus-line. They righted themselves and
shot off with streamlined jet propulsion.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond rested for a moment about half way and then
went on. Now there were barracuda about, big ones of
up to twenty pounds. They looked just as deadly as he
had remembered them. They glided above him like silver
submarines, looking down out of their angry tigers’
eyes. They were curious about him and about his
bubbles and they followed him, around and above him,
like a pack of silent wolves. By the time Bond met the
first bit of coral that meant he was coming up with the
island there must have been twenty of them moving
quietly, watchfully in and out of the opaque wall that
enclosed him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s skin cringed under the black rubber but he
could do nothing about them and he concentrated on
his objective.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly there was a long metallic shape hanging in
the water above him. Behind it there was a jumble of
broken rock leading steeply upwards.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was the keel of the <span class="it">Secatur</span> and Bond’s heart
thumped in his chest.</p>

<p class="pindent">He looked at the Rolex watch on his wrist. It was
three minutes past eleven o’clock. He selected the seven-hour
fuse from the handful he extracted from a zipped
side-pocket and inserted it in the fuse pocket of the
mine and pushed it home. The rest of the fuses he
buried in the sand so that if he was captured the mine
would not be betrayed.</p>

<p class="pindent">As he swam up, carrying the mine between his hands,
bottom upwards, he was aware of a commotion in the
water behind him. A barracuda flashed by, its jaws
half open, almost hitting him, its eyes fixed on something
at his back. But Bond was intent only on the
centre of the ship’s keel and on a point about three feet
above it.</p>

<p class="pindent">The mine almost dragged him the last few feet, its
huge magnets straining for the metallic kiss with the
hull. Bond had to pull hard against it to prevent the
clang of contact. Then it was silently in place and with
its weight removed Bond had to swim strongly to
counter his new buoyancy and get down again and away
from the surface.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was as he turned to swim towards the twin propellers
on his way to the shelter of the rocks that he
suddenly saw the terrible things that had been going
on behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">The great pack of barracuda seemed to have gone
mad. They were whirling and snapping in the water
like hysterical dogs. Three sharks that had joined them
were charging through the water with a clumsier frenzy.
The water was boiling with the dreadful fish and Bond
was slammed in the face and buffeted again and again
within a few yards. At any moment he knew his rubber
skin would be torn with the flesh below it and then
the pack would be on him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Extreme mob behaviour conditions.’ The Navy
Department’s phrase flashed into his mind. This was
just when he might have saved himself with the shark-repellent
stuff. Without it he might only have a few
more minutes to live.</p>

<p class="pindent">In desperation he threshed through the water along
the ship’s keel, the safety-catch up on the harpoon gun
that was now only a toy in the face of this drove of
maddened cannibal fish.</p>

<p class="pindent">He reached the two big copper screws and clung to
one of them, panting, his lips drawn back from his
teeth in a snarl of fear, his eyes distended as he faced
the frenzy of the boiling sea around him.</p>

<p class="pindent">He at once saw that the mouths of the hurtling,
darting fish were half open and that they were plunging
in and out of a brownish cloud, spreading downwards
from the surface. Close to him a barracuda hung for
an instant, something brown and glittering in its jaws.
It gave a great swallow and then swirled back into the
mêlée.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the same time he noticed that it was getting darker.
He looked up and saw with dawning comprehension
that the quicksilver surface of the sea had turned red,
a horrible glinting crimson.</p>

<p class="pindent">Threads of the stuff drifted within his reach. He
hooked some towards him with the end of his gun.
Held the end close up against his glass mask.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was no doubt about it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Up above, someone was spraying the surface of the
sea with blood and offal.</p>
