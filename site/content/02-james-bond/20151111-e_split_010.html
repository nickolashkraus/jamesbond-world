<p class="pindent">Mr Big reflected for a moment. He seemed to decide.
He pressed a switch on the intercom.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Blabbermouth?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yassuh, Boss.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’re holding that American, Leiter.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yassuh.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hurt him considerably. Ride him down to Bellevue
Hospital and dump him nearby. Got that?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yassuh.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t be seen.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nossuh.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Big centred the switch.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘God damn your bloody eyes,’ said Bond viciously.
‘The CIA won’t let you get away with this!’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You forget, Mister Bond. They have no jurisdiction
in America. The American Secret Service has no power
in America—only abroad. And the FBI are no friends
of theirs. Tee-Hee, come here.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yassuh, Boss.’ Tee-Hee came and stood beside the
desk.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Big looked across at Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Which finger do you use least, Mister Bond?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was startled by the question. His mind raced.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘On reflection, I expect you will say the little finger
of the left hand,’ continued the soft voice. ‘Tee-Hee,
break the little finger of Mr Bond’s left hand.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The negro showed the reason for his nickname.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hee-hee,’ he gave a falsetto giggle. ‘Hee-hee.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He walked jauntily over to Bond. Bond clutched
madly at the arms of his chair. Sweat started to break
out on his forehead. He tried to imagine the pain so
that he could control it.</p>

<p class="pindent">The negro slowly unhinged the little finger of Bond’s
left hand, immovably bound to the arm of his chair.</p>

<p class="pindent">He held the tip between finger and thumb and very
deliberately started to bend it back, giggling inanely to
himself.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond rolled and heaved, trying to upset the chair,
but Tee-Hee put his other hand on the chair-back and
held it there. The sweat poured off Bond’s face. His
teeth started to bare in an involuntary rictus. Through
the increasing pain he could just see the girl’s eyes wide
upon him, her red lips slightly parted.</p>

<p class="pindent">The finger stood upright, away from the hand. Started
to bend slowly backwards towards his wrist. Suddenly
it gave. There was a sharp crack.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That will do,’ said Mr Big.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tee-Hee released the mangled finger with reluctance.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond uttered a soft animal groan and fainted.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Da guy ain’t got no sensayuma,’ commented Tee-Hee.</p>

<p class="pindent">Solitaire sat limply back in her chair and closed her
eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Did he have a gun?’ asked Mr Big.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yassuh.’ Tee-Hee took Bond’s Beretta out of his
pocket and slipped it across the desk. The Big Man
picked it up and looked at it expertly. He weighed it in
his hand, testing the feel of the skeleton grip. Then he
pumped the shells out on to the desk, verified that he
had also emptied the chamber and slid it over towards
Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Wake him up,’ he said, looking at his watch. It said
three o’clock.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tee-Hee went behind Bond’s chair and dug his nails
into the lobes of Bond’s ears.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond groaned and lifted his head.</p>

<p class="pindent">His eyes focused on Mr Big and he uttered a string
of obscenities.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Be thankful you’re not dead,’ said Mr Big without
emotion. ‘Any pain is preferable to death. Here is your
gun. I have the shells. Tee-Hee, give it back to him.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Tee-Hee took it off the desk and slipped it back into
Bond’s holster.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I will explain to you briefly,’ continued The Big Man,
‘why it is that you are not dead; why you have been
permitted to enjoy the sensation of pain instead of
adding to the pollution of the Harlem River from the
folds of what is jocularly known as a cement overcoat.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He paused for a moment and then spoke.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mister Bond, I suffer from boredom. I am a prey to
what the early Christians called “accidie”, the deadly
lethargy that envelops those who are sated, those who
have no more desires. I am absolutely pre-eminent in
my chosen profession, trusted by those who occasionally
employ my talents, feared and instantly obeyed by
those whom I myself employ. I have, literally, no more
worlds to conquer within my chosen orbit. Alas, it is
too late in my life to change that orbit for another one,
and since power is the goal of all ambition, it is unlikely
that I could possibly acquire more power in another
sphere than I already possess in this one.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond listened with part of his mind. With the other
half he was already planning. He sensed the presence
of Solitaire, but he kept his eyes off her. He gazed
steadily across the table at the great grey face with its
unwinking golden eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">The soft voice continued.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mister Bond, I take pleasure now only in artistry, in
the polish and finesse which I can bring to my operations.
It has become almost a mania with me to impart
an absolute rightness, a high elegance, to the execution
of my affairs. Each day, Mister Bond, I try and set
myself still higher standards of subtlety and technical
polish so that each of my proceedings may be a work
of art, bearing my signature as clearly as the creations
of, let us say, Benvenuto Cellini. I am content, for the
time being, to be my only judge, but I sincerely believe,
Mister Bond, that the approach to perfection which I
am steadily achieving in my operations will ultimately
win recognition in the history of our times.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Big paused. Bond saw that his great yellow
eyes were wide, as if he saw visions. He’s a raving
megalomaniac, thought Bond. And all the more dangerous
because of it. The fault in most criminal minds was that
greed was their only impulse. A dedicated mind was quite
another matter. This man was no gangster. He was a
menace. Bond was fascinated and slightly awestruck.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I accept anonymity for two reasons,’ continued the
low voice. ‘Because the nature of my operations
demands it and because I admire the self-negation of
the anonymous artist. If you will allow the conceit, I
see myself sometimes as one of those great Egyptian
fresco painters who devoted their lives to producing
masterpieces in the tombs of kings, knowing that no
living eye would ever see them.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The great eyes closed for a moment.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘However, let us return to the particular. The reason,
Mister Bond, why I have not killed you this morning
is because it would give me no aesthetic pleasure to
blow a hole in your stomach. With this engine,’ he
gestured towards the gun trained on Bond through the
desk drawer, ‘I have already blown many holes in many
stomachs, so I am quite satisfied that my little mechanical
toy is a sound technical achievement. Moreover, as
no doubt you rightly surmise, it would be a nuisance
for me to have a lot of busybodies around here asking
questions about the disappearance of yourself and your
friend Mr Leiter. Not more than a nuisance; but for
various reasons I wish to concentrate on other matters
at the present time.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So,’ Mr Big looked at his watch, ‘I decided to leave
my card upon each of you and to give you one more
solemn warning. You must leave the country today, and
Mr Leiter must transfer to another assignment. I have
quite enough to bother me without having a lot of
agents from Europe added to the considerable strength
of local busybodies with which I have to contend.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That is all,’ he concluded. ‘If I see you again, you
will die in a manner as ingenious and appropriate as I
can devise on that day.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Tee-Hee, take Mr Bond to the garage. Tell two of
the men to take him to Central Park and throw him in
the ornamental water. He may be damaged but not
killed if he resists. Understood?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yassuh, Boss,’ said Tee-Hee, giggling in a high
falsetto.</p>

<p class="pindent">He undid Bond’s ankles, then his wrists. He took
Bond’s injured hand and twisted it right up his back.
Then with his other hand he undid the strap round his
waist. He yanked Bond to his feet.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Giddap,’ said Tee-Hee.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gazed once more into the great grey face.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Those who deserve to die,’ he paused, ‘die the death
they deserve. Write that down,’ he added. ‘It’s an original
thought.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he glanced at Solitaire. Her eyes were bent on
the hands in her lap. She didn’t look up.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Git goin’,’ said Tee-Hee. He turned Bond round
towards the wall and pushed him forward, twisting
Bond’s wrist up his back until his forearm was almost
dislocated. Bond uttered a realistic groan and his footsteps
faltered. He wanted Tee-Hee to believe that he
was cowed and docile. He wanted the torturing grip to
ease just a little on his left arm. As it was, any sudden
movement would only result in his arm being broken.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tee-Hee reached over Bond’s shoulder and pressed
on one of the books in the serried shelves. A large
section opened on a central pivot. Bond was pushed
through and the negro kicked the heavy section back
into place. It closed with a double click. From the thickness
of the door, Bond guessed it would be sound-proof.
They were faced by a short carpeted passage ending in
some stairs that led downwards. Bond groaned.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’re breaking my arm,’ he said. ‘Look out. I’m
going to faint.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He stumbled again, trying to measure exactly the
negro’s position behind him. He remembered Leiter’s
injunction: ‘Shins, groin, stomach, throat. Hit ’em
anywhere else and you’ll just break your hand.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Shut yo mouf,’ said the negro, but he pulled Bond’s
hand an inch or two down his back.</p>

<p class="pindent">This was all Bond needed.</p>

<p class="pindent">They were half way down the passage with only a
few feet more to the top of the stairs. Bond faltered
again, so that the negro’s body bumped into his. This
gave him all the range and direction he needed.</p>

<p class="pindent">He bent a little and his right hand, straight and flat
as a board, whipped round and inwards. He felt it thud
hard into the target. The negro screamed shrilly like a
wounded rabbit. Bond felt his left arm come free. He
whirled round, pulling out his empty gun with his right
hand. The negro was bent double, his hands between
his legs, uttering little panting screams. Bond whipped
the gun down hard on the back of the woolly skull. It
gave back a dull klonk as if he had hammered on a
door, but the negro groaned and fell forward on his
knees, throwing out his hands for support. Bond got
behind him and, with all the force he could put behind
the steel-capped shoe, he gave one mighty kick below
the lavender-coloured seat of the negro’s pants.</p>

<p class="pindent">A final short scream was driven out of the man as
he sailed the few feet to the stairs. His head hit the side
of the iron banisters and then, a twisting wheel of arms
and legs, he disappeared over the edge, down into the
well. There was a short crash as he caromed off some
obstacle, then a pause, then a mingled thud and crack
as he hit the ground. Then silence.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond wiped the sweat out of his eyes and stood
listening. He thrust his wounded left hand into his coat.
It was throbbing with pain and swollen to almost twice
its normal size. Holding his gun in his right hand, he
walked to the head of the stairs and slowly down,
moving softly on the balls of his feet.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was only one floor between him and the spread-eagled
body below. When he reached the landing, he
stopped again and listened. Quite close, he could hear
the high-pitched whine of some form of fast wireless
transmitter. He verified that it came from behind one
of the two doors on the landing. This must be Mr Big’s
communications centre. He longed to carry out a quick
raid. But his gun was empty and he had no idea how
many men he would find in the room. It could only
have been the earphones on their ears that had prevented
the operators from hearing the sounds of Tee-Hee’s
fall. He crept on down.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tee-Hee was either dead or dying. He lay spread-eagled
on his back. His striped tie lay across his face
like a squashed adder. Bond felt no remorse. He frisked
the body for a gun and found one stuck in the waistband
of the lavender trousers, now stained with blood. It
was a Colt .38 Detective Special with a sawn barrel. All
chambers were loaded. Bond slipped the useless Beretta
back in its holster. He nestled the big gun into his palm
and smiled grimly.</p>

<p class="pindent">A small door faced him, bolted on the inside. Bond
put his ear to it. The muffled sound of an engine reached
him. This must be the garage. But the running engine?
At that time of the morning? Bond ground his teeth. Of
course. Mr Big would have spoken on the intercom and
warned them that Tee-Hee was bringing him down. They
must be wondering what was holding him up. They were
probably watching the door for the negro to emerge.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond thought for a moment. He had the advantage
of surprise. If only the bolts were well-oiled.</p>

<p class="pindent">His left hand was almost useless. With the Colt in
his right, he tested the first bolt with the edge of his
damaged hand. It slipped easily back. So did the second.
There remained only a press-down handle. He eased it
down and pulled the door softly towards him.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a thick door and the noise of the engine got
louder as the crack widened. The car must be just
outside. Any further movement of the door would
betray him. He whipped it open and stood facing sideways
like a fencer so as to offer as small a target as
possible. The hammer lay back on his gun.</p>

<p class="pindent">A few feet away stood a black sedan, its engine
running. It faced the open double doors of the garage.
Bright arclights lit up the shining bodywork of several
other cars. There was a big negro at the wheel of the
sedan and another stood near him, leaning against the
rear door. No one else was in view.</p>

<p class="pindent">At sight of Bond the negroes’ mouths fell open in
astonishment. A cigarette dropped from the mouth of
the man at the wheel. Then they both dived for their
guns.</p>

<p class="pindent">Instinctively, Bond shot first at the man standing,
knowing he would be quickest on the draw.</p>

<p class="pindent">The heavy gun roared hollowly in the garage.</p>

<p class="pindent">The negro clutched his stomach with both hands,
staggered two steps towards Bond, and collapsed on
his face, his gun clattering on to the concrete.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man at the wheel screamed as Bond’s gun swung
on to him. Hampered by the wheel, the negro’s shooting
hand was still inside his coat.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shot straight into the screaming mouth and the
man’s head crashed against the side window.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond ran round the car and opened the door. The
negro sprawled horribly out. Bond threw his revolver
on to the driving-seat and yanked the body out on to
the ground. He tried to avoid the blood. He got into
the seat and blessed the running engine and the steering-wheel
gear-lever. He slammed the door, rested his
injured hand on the left of the wheel and crashed the
lever forward.</p>

<p class="pindent">The hand-brake was still on. He had to lean under
the wheel to release it with his right hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a dangerous pause. As the heavy car surged
forward out of the wide doors there was the boom of
a gun and a bullet hammered into the bodywork. He
tore the wheel round right-handed and there was
another shot that missed high. Across the street a
window splintered.</p>

<p class="pindent">The flash came from low down near the floor and
Bond guessed that the first negro had somehow
managed to reach his gun.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were no other shots and no sound came from
the blank faces of the buildings behind him. As he went
through the gears he could see nothing in the driving-mirror
except the broad bar of light from the garage
shining out across the dark empty street.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had no idea where he was or where he was
heading. It was a wide featureless street and he kept
going. He found himself driving on the left-hand side
and quickly swerved over to the right. His hand hurt
terribly but the thumb and forefinger helped to steady
the wheel. He tried to remember to keep his left side
away from the blood on the door and window. The
endless street was populated only by the little ghosts
of steam that wavered up out of the gratings in the
asphalt that gave access to the piped heat system of
the city. The ugly bonnet of the car mowed them down
one by one, but in the driving-mirror Bond could see
them rising again behind him in a diminishing vista of
mildly gesticulating white wraiths.</p>

<p class="pindent">He kept the big car at fifty. He came to some red
traffic lights and jumped them. Several more dark blocks
and then there was a lighted avenue. There was traffic
and he paused until the lights went green. He turned
left and was rewarded by a succession of green lights,
each one sweeping him on and further away from the
enemy. He checked at an intersection and read the signs.
He was on Park Avenue and 116th Street. He slowed
again at the next street. It was 115th. He was heading
downtown, away from Harlem, back into the City. He
kept going. He turned off at 60th Street. It was deserted.
He switched off the engine and left the car opposite a
fire hydrant. He took the gun off the seat, shoved it
down the waistband of his trousers and walked back to
Park Avenue.</p>

<p class="pindent">A few minutes later he flagged a prowling cab and then
suddenly he was walking up the steps of the St Regis.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Message for you, Mr Bond,’ said the night porter.
Bond kept his left side away from him. He opened the
message with his right hand. It was from Felix Leiter,
timed at four a.m. ‘Call me at once,’ it said.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked to the elevator and was carried up to
his floor. He let himself into 2100 and went through
into the sitting-room.</p>

<p class="pindent">So both of them were alive. Bond fell into a chair
beside the telephone.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘God Almighty,’ said Bond with deep gratitude. ‘What
a break.’</p>
