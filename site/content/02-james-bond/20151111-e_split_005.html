<p class="pindent">And now it was ten days later and the talk with Dexter
and Leiter had not added much, reflected Bond as he
awoke slowly and luxuriously in his bedroom at the St
Regis the morning after his arrival in New York.</p>

<p class="pindent">Dexter had had plenty of detail on Mr Big, but
nothing that threw any new light on the case. Mr Big
was forty-five years old, born in Haiti, half negro and
half French. Because of the initial letters of his fanciful
name, Buonaparte Ignace Gallia, and because of his
huge height and bulk, he came to be called, even as a
youth, ‘Big Boy’ or just ‘Big’. Later this became ‘The
Big Man’ or ‘Mr Big’, and his real names lingered only
on a parish register in Haiti and on his dossier with the
FBI. He had no known vices except women, whom he
consumed in quantities. He didn’t drink or smoke and
his only Achilles’ heel appeared to be a chronic heart
disease which had, in recent years, imparted a greyish
tinge to his skin.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Big Boy had been initiated into Voodoo as a
child, earned his living as a truck-driver in Port au Prince,
then emigrated to America and worked successfully for
a hi-jacking team in the Legs Diamond gang. With the
end of Prohibition he had moved to Harlem and bought
half-shares in a small nightclub and a string of coloured
call-girls. His partner was found in a barrel of cement
in the Harlem River in 1938 and Mr Big automatically
became sole proprietor of the business. He was called
up in 1943 and, because of his excellent French, came
to the notice of the Office of Strategic Services, the
wartime secret service of America, who trained him
with great thoroughness and put him into Marseilles as
an agent against the Pétain collaborationists. He merged
easily with African negro dock-hands, and worked well,
providing good and accurate naval intelligence. He operated
closely with a Soviet spy who was doing a similar
job for the Russians. At the end of the war he was
demobilized in France (and decorated by the Americans
and the French) and then he disappeared for five years,
probably to Moscow. He returned to Harlem in 1950
and soon came to the notice of the FBI as a suspected
Soviet agent. But he never incriminated himself or fell
into any of the traps laid by the FBI. He bought up
three nightclubs and a prosperous chain of Harlem
brothels. He seemed to have unlimited funds and paid
all his lieutenants a flat rate of twenty thousand dollars
a year. Accordingly, and as a result of weeding by
murder, he was expertly and diligently served. He was
known to have originated an underground Voodoo
temple in Harlem and to have established a link between
it and the main cult in Haiti. The rumour had started
that he was the Zombie or living corpse of Baron
Samedi himself, the dreaded Prince of Darkness, and
he fostered the story so that now it was accepted
through all the lower strata of the negro world. As a
result, he commanded real fear, strongly substantiated
by the immediate and often mysterious deaths of anyone
who crossed him or disobeyed his orders.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had questioned Dexter and Leiter very closely
on the evidence connecting the giant negro with
<span class="calibre4">SMERSH</span>. It certainly seemed conclusive.</p>

<p class="pindent">In 1951, by the promise of one million dollars in gold
and a safe refuge after six months’ work for them, the
FBI had at last persuaded a known Soviet agent of the
MWD to turn double. All went well for a month and
the results exceeded the highest expectations. The
Russian spy held the appointment of an economic
expert on the Soviet delegation to the United Nations.
One Saturday, he had gone to take the subway to
Pennsylvania Station en route for the Soviet week-end
rest camp at Glen Cove, the former Morgan estate on
Long Island.</p>

<p class="pindent">A huge negro, positively identified from photographs
as The Big Man, had stood beside him on the platform
as the train came in and was seen walking towards the
exit even before the first coach had come to a standstill
over the bloody vestiges of the Russian. He had not
been seen to push the man, but in the crowd it would
not have been difficult. Spectators said it could not have
been suicide. The man screamed horribly as he fell and
he had had (melancholy touch!) a bag of golf clubs
over his shoulder. The Big Man, of course, had had an
alibi as solid as Fort Knox. He had been held and
questioned, but was quickly sprung by the best lawyer
in Harlem.</p>

<p class="pindent">The evidence was good enough for Bond. He was
just the man for <span class="calibre4">SMERSH</span>, with just the training. A real,
hard weapon of fear and death. And what a brilliant
set-up for dealing with the smaller fry of the negro
underworld and for keeping a coloured information
network well up to the mark!—the fear of Voodoo and
the supernatural, still deeply, primevally ingrained in the
negro subconscious! And what genius to have, as a
beginning, the whole transport system of America
under surveillance, the trains, the porters, the truck-drivers,
the stevedores! To have at his disposal a host
of key men who would have no idea that the questions
they answered had been asked by Russia. Small-time
professional men who, if they thought at all, would
guess that the information on freights and schedules
was being sold to rival transport concerns.</p>

<p class="pindent">Not for the first time, Bond felt his spine crawl at
the cold, brilliant efficiency of the Soviet machine, and
at the fear of death and torture which made it work
and of which the supreme engine was <span class="it">SMERSH</span>—<span class="calibre4">SMERSH</span>,
the very whisper of death.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now, in his bedroom at the St Regis, Bond shook
away his thoughts and jumped impatiently out of bed.
Well, there was one of them at hand, ready for the
crushing. At Royale he had only caught a glimpse of
his man. This time it would be face to face. Big Man?
Then let it be a giant, a homeric slaying.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked over to the window and pulled back
the curtains. His room faced north, towards Harlem.
Bond gazed for a moment towards the northern
horizon, where another man would be in his bedroom
asleep, or perhaps awake and thinking conceivably of
him, Bond, whom he had seen with Dexter on the steps
of the hotel. Bond looked at the beautiful day and
smiled. And no man, not even Mr Big, would have liked
the expression on his face.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shrugged his shoulders and walked quickly to
the telephone.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘St Regis Hotel. Good morning,’ said a voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Room Service, please,’ said Bond. ‘Room Service?
I’d like to order breakfast. Half a pint of orange juice,
three eggs, lightly scrambled, with bacon, a double
portion of Café Espresso with cream. Toast. Marmalade.
Got it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The order was repeated back to him. Bond walked
out into the lobby and picked up the five pounds’ weight
of newspapers which had been placed quietly inside
the door earlier in the morning. There was also a pile
of parcels on the hall table which Bond disregarded.</p>

<p class="pindent">The afternoon before he had had to submit to a
certain degree of Americanization at the hands of the
FBI. A tailor had come and measured him for two
single-breasted suits in dark blue light-weight worsted
(Bond had firmly refused anything more dashing) and
a haberdasher had brought chilly white nylon shirts with
long points to the collars. He had had to accept half a
dozen unusually patterned foulard ties, dark socks with
fancy clocks, two or three ‘display kerchiefs’ for his
breast pocket, nylon vests and pants (called T-shirts and
shorts), a comfortable light-weight camel-hair overcoat
with over-buttressed shoulders, a plain grey snapbrim
Fedora with a thin black ribbon and two pairs of hand-stitched
and very comfortable black Moccasin
‘casuals’.</p>

<p class="pindent">He also acquired a ‘Swank’ tie-clip in the shape of a
whip, an alligator-skin billfold from Mark Cross, a plain
Zippo lighter, a plastic ‘Travel-Pak’ containing razor,
hairbrush and toothbrush, a pair of horn-rimmed
glasses with plain lenses, various other oddments and,
finally, a light-weight Hartmann ‘Skymate’ suitcase to
contain all these things.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was allowed to retain his own Beretta .25 with
the skeleton grip and the chamois leather shoulder-holster,
but all his other possessions were to be collected
at midday and forwarded down to Jamaica to await
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was given a military haircut and was told that he
was a New Englander from Boston and that he was on
holiday from his job with the London office of the
Guaranty Trust Company. He was reminded to ask for
the ‘check’ rather than the ‘bill’, to say ‘cab’ instead of
‘taxi’ and (this from Leiter) to avoid words of more
than two syllables. (‘You can get through any American
conversation,’ advised Leiter, ‘with “Yeah”, “Nope” and
“Sure”.’) The English word to be avoided at all costs,
added Leiter, was ‘Ectually’. Bond had said that this
word was not part of his vocabulary.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked grimly at the pile of parcels which
contained his new identity, stripped off his pyjamas for
the last time (‘We mostly sleep in the raw in America,
Mr Bond’) and gave himself a sizzling cold shower. As
he shaved he examined his face in the glass. The thick
comma of black hair above his right eyebrow had lost
some of its tail and his hair was trimmed close across
the temples. Nothing could be done about the thin
vertical scar down his right cheek, although the FBI
had experimented with Cover-Mark, or about the coldness
and hint of anger in his grey-blue eyes, but there
was the mixed blood of America in the black hair and
high cheek-bones and Bond thought he might get by—except,
perhaps, with women.</p>

<p class="pindent">Naked, Bond walked out into the lobby and tore open
some of the packages. Later, in a white shirt and dark
blue trousers, he went into the sitting-room, pulled a
chair up to the writing-desk near the window and
opened <span class="it">The Travellers Tree</span>, by Patrick Leigh Fermor.</p>

<p class="pindent">This extraordinary book had been recommended to
him by M.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s by a chap who knows what he’s talking about,’
he said, ‘and don’t forget that he was writing about what
was happening in Haiti in 1950. This isn’t medieval
black-magic stuff. It’s being practised every day.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was half way through the section on Haiti.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="pindent">The next step [he read] is the invocation of evil denizens
of the Voodoo pantheon—such as Don Pedro,
Kitta, Mondongue, Bakalou and Zandor—for harmful
purposes, for the reputed practice (which is of
Congolese origin) of turning people into zombies in
order to use them as slaves, the casting of maleficent
spells, and the destruction of enemies. The effects of
the spell, of which the outward form may be an image
of the intended victim, a miniature coffin or a toad,
are frequently stiffened by the separate use of poison.
Father Cosme enlarged on the superstitions that maintain
that men with certain powers change themselves
into snakes; on the ‘Loups-Garoups’ that fly at night
in the form of vampire bats and suck the blood of
children; on men who reduce themselves to infinitesimal
size and roll about the countryside in calabashes.
What sounded far more sinister were a number of
mystico-criminal secret societies of wizards, with nightmarish
titles—‘les Mackanda’, named after the poison
campaign of the Haitian hero; ‘les Zobop’, who were
also robbers; the ‘Mazanxa’, the ‘Caporelata’ and the
‘Vlinbindingue’. These, he said, were the mysterious
groups whose gods demand—instead of a cock, a
pigeon, a goat, a dog, or a pig, as in the normal rites
of Voodoo—the sacrifice of a ‘cabrit sans cornes’.
This hornless goat, of course, means a human
being . . .</p>

</div>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned over the pages, occasional passages
combining to form an extraordinary picture in his mind
of a dark religion and its terrible rites.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="pindent">. . . Slowly, out of the turmoil and the smoke and the
shattering noise of the drums, which, for a time, drove
everything except their impact from the mind, the details
began to detach themselves . . .</p>

<p class="pindent">. . . Backwards and forwards, very slowly, the dancers
shuffled, and at each step their chins shot out and their
buttocks jerked upwards, while their shoulders shook
in double time. Their eyes were half closed and from
their mouths came again and again the same incomprehensible
words, the same short line of chanted song,
repeated after each iteration, half an octave lower. At
a change in the beat of the drums, they straightened
their bodies, and flinging their arms in the air while
their eyes rolled upwards, spun round and round . . .</p>

<p class="pindent">. . . At the edge of the crowd we came upon a little
hut, scarcely larger than a dog kennel: ‘Le caye Zombi’.
The beam of a torch revealed a black cross inside and
some rags and chains and shackles and whips: adjuncts
used at the Ghédé ceremonies, which Haitian ethnologists
connect with the rejuvenation rites of Osiris
recorded in the Book of the Dead. A fire was burning,
in which two sabres and a large pair of pincers were
standing, their lower parts red with the heat: ‘le Feu
Marinette’, dedicated to a goddess who is the evil
obverse of the bland and amorous Maîtresse Erzulie
Fréda Dahomin, the Goddess of Love.</p>

<p class="pindent">Beyond, with its base held fast in a socket of stone,
stood a large black wooden cross. A white death’s head
was painted near the base, and over the crossbar were
pulled the sleeves of a very old morning coat. Here
also rested the brim of a battered bowler hat, through
the torn crown of which the top of the cross projected.
This totem, with which every peristyle must be
equipped, is not a lampoon of the central event of the
Christian faith, but represents the God of the Cemeteries
and the Chief of the Legion of the Dead, Baron
Samedi. The Baron is paramount in all matters immediately
beyond the tomb. He is Cerberus and Charon
as well as Aeacus, Rhadamanthus and Pluto . . .</p>

<p class="pindent">. . . The drums changed and the Houngenikon came
dancing on to the floor, holding a vessel filled with
some burning liquid from which sprang blue and yellow
flames. As he circled the pillar and spilt three flaming
libations, his steps began to falter. Then, lurching backwards
with the same symptoms of delirium that had
manifested themselves in his forerunner, he flung down
the whole blazing mass. The houncis caught him as he
reeled, and removed his sandals and rolled his trousers
up, while the kerchief fell from his head and laid bare
his young woolly skull. The other houncis knelt to put
their hands in the flaming mud, and rub it over their
hands and elbows and faces. The Houngan’s bell and
‘açon’ rattled officiously and the young priest was left
by himself, reeling and colliding against the pillar, helplessly
catapulting across the floor, and falling among
the drums. His eyes were shut, his forehead screwed
up and his chin hung loose. Then, as though an invisible
fist had dealt him a heavy blow, he fell to the
ground and lay there, with his head stretching backwards
in a rictus of anguish until the tendons of his
neck and shoulders projected like roots. One hand
clutched at the other elbow behind his hollowed back
as though he were striving to break his own arm, and
his whole body, from which the sweat was streaming,
trembled and shuddered like a dog in a dream. Only
the whites of his eyes were visible as, although his
eye-sockets were now wide open, the pupils had
vanished under the lids. Foam collected on his
lips . . .</p>

<p class="pindent">. . . Now the Houngan, dancing a slow step and brandishing
a cutlass, advanced from the fireside, flinging
the weapon again and again into the air, and catching
it by the hilt. In a few minutes he was holding it by
the blunted end of the blade. Dancing slowly towards
him, the Houngenikon reached out and grasped the
hilt. The priest retired, and the young man, twirling
and leaping, spun from side to side of the ‘tonnelle’.
The ring of spectators rocked backwards as he bore
down upon them whirling the blade over his head, with
the gaps in his bared teeth lending to his mandril face
a still more feral aspect. The ‘tonnelle’ was filled for a
few seconds with genuine and unmitigated terror. The
singing had turned to a universal howl and the drummers,
rolling and lolling with the furious and invisible
motion of their hands, were lost in a transport of
noise.</p>

<p class="pindent">Flinging back his head, the novice drove the blunt
end of the cutlass into his stomach. His knees sagged,
and his head fell forward . . .</p>

</div>

<p class="pindent">There came a knock on the door and a waiter came
in with breakfast. Bond was glad to put the dreadful
tale aside and re-enter the world of normality. But it
took him minutes to forget the atmosphere, heavy
with terror and the occult, that had surrounded him
as he read.</p>

<p class="pindent">With breakfast came another parcel, about a foot
square, expensive-looking, which Bond told the waiter
to put on the sideboard. Some afterthought of Leiter’s,
he supposed. He ate his breakfast with enjoyment.
Between mouthfuls he looked out of the wide window
and reflected on what he had just read.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was only when he had swallowed his last mouthful
of coffee and had lit his first cigarette of the day that
he suddenly became aware of the tiny noise in the room
behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a soft, muffled ticking, unhurried, metallic. And
it came from the direction of the sideboard.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Tick-tock . . . tick-tock . . . tick-tock.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Without a moment’s hesitation, without caring that
he looked a fool, he dived to the floor behind his
armchair and crouched, all his senses focused on the
noise from the square parcel. ‘Steady,’ he said to himself.
‘Don’t be an idiot. It’s just a clock.’ But why a clock?
Why should he be given a clock? Who by?</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Tick-tock . . . tick-tock . . . tick-tock.’</p>

<p class="pindent">It had become a huge noise against the silence of
the room. It seemed to be keeping time with the
thumping of Bond’s heart. ‘Don’t be ridiculous. That
Voodoo stuff of Leigh Fermor’s has put your nerves
on edge. Those drums . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Tick-tock . . . tick-tock . . . Tick—’</p>

<p class="pindent">And then, suddenly, the alarm went off with a deep,
melodious, urgent summons.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Tongtongtongtongtongtong . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s muscles relaxed. His cigarette was burning a
hole in the carpet. He picked it up and put it in his
mouth. Bombs in alarm clocks go off when the hammer
first comes down on the alarm. The hammer hits a pin
in a detonator, the detonator fires the explosive and
WHAM . . .</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond raised his head above the back of the chair and
watched the parcel.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Tongtongtongtongtong . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">The muffled gonging went on for half a minute, then
it started to slow down.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘tong . . . tong . . . tong . . . tong . . . tong . . .</p>

<p class="pindent">‘C-R-A-C-K . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">It was not louder than a 12-bore cartridge, but in the
confined space it was an impressive explosion.</p>

<p class="pindent">The parcel, in tatters, had fallen to the ground. The
glasses and bottles on the sideboard were smashed and
there was a black smudge of smoke on the grey wall
behind them. Some pieces of glass tinkled on to the floor.
There was a strong smell of gunpowder in the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got slowly to his feet. He went to the window
and opened it. Then he dialled Dexter’s number. He
spoke levelly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Pineapple . . . No, a small one . . . only some
glasses . . . okay, thanks . . . of course not . . . ’bye.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He skirted the debris, walked through the small lobby
to the door leading into the passage, opened it, hung
the <span class="calibre4">DON’T DISTURB</span> sign outside, locked it and went
through into his bedroom.</p>

<p class="pindent">By the time he had finished dressing there was a
knock on the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Who is it?’ he called.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Okay. Dexter.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Dexter hustled in, followed by a sallow young man
with a black box under his arm.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Trippe, from Sabotage,’ announced Dexter.</p>

<p class="pindent">They shook hands and the young man at once went
on his knees beside the charred remnants of the parcel.</p>

<p class="pindent">He opened his box and took out some rubber gloves
and a handful of dentist’s forceps. With his tools he
painstakingly extracted small bits of metal and glass
from the charred parcel and laid them out on a broad
sheet of blotting paper from the writing-desk.</p>

<p class="pindent">While he worked, he asked Bond what had happened.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘About a half-minute alarm? I see. Hullo, what’s this?’
He delicately extracted a small aluminium container
such as is used for exposed film. He put it aside.</p>

<p class="pindent">After a few minutes he sat up on his haunches.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Half-minute acid capsule,’ he announced. ‘Broken by
the first hammer-stroke of the alarm. Acid eats through
thin copper wire. Thirty seconds later wire breaks,
releases plunger on to cap of this.’ He held up the base
of a cartridge. ‘4-bore elephant gun. Black powder.
Blank. No shot. Lucky it wasn’t a grenade. Plenty of
room in the parcel. You’d have been damaged. Now
let’s have a look at this.’ He picked up the aluminium
cylinder, unscrewed it, extracted a small roll of paper,
and unravelled it with his forceps.</p>

<p class="pindent">He carefully flattened it out on the carpet, holding
its corners down with four tools from his black box. It
contained three typewritten sentences. Bond and Dexter
bent forward.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="calibre4">THE HEART OF THIS CLOCK HAS STOPPED TICKING</span>,’
they read, ‘<span class="calibre4">THE BEATS OF YOUR OWN HEART ARE
NUMBERED. I KNOW THAT NUMBER AND I HAVE
STARTED TO COUNT.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">The message was signed ‘1234567 . . . ?’</p>

<p class="pindent">They stood up.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hm,’ said Bond. ‘Bogeyman stuff.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But how the hell did he know you were here?’ asked
Dexter.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond told him of the black sedan on 55th Street.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But the point is,’ said Bond, ‘how did he know what
I was here <span class="it">for</span>? Shows he’s got Washington pretty well
sewn up. Must be a leak the size of the Grand Canyon
somewhere.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Why should it be Washington?’ asked Dexter testily.
‘Anyway,’ he controlled himself with a forced laugh,
‘Hell and damnation. Have to make a report to Headquarters
on this. So long, Mr Bond. Glad you came to
no harm.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thanks,’ said Bond. ‘It was just a visiting-card. I must
return the compliment.’</p>
