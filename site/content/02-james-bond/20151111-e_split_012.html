<p class="pindent">Bond, the collar of his new raincoat up round his ears,
was missed as he came out of the entrance of the St
Regis Drugstore on 55th Street, which has a connecting
door into the hotel.</p>

<p class="pindent">He waited in the entrance and leaped at a cruising cab,
hooking the door open with the thumb of his injured
hand and throwing his light suitcase in ahead of him.
The cab hardly checked. The negro with the collecting-box
for the Colored Veterans of Korea and his colleague
fumbling under the bonnet of his stalled car stayed on
the job until, much later, they were called off by a man
who drove past and sounded two shorts and a long on
his horn.</p>

<p class="pindent">But Bond was immediately spotted as he left his cab
at the drive-in to the Pennsylvania Station. A lounging
negro with a wicker basket walked quickly into a call-box.
It was ten-fifteen.</p>

<p class="pindent">Only fifteen minutes to go and yet, just before the
train started, one of the waiters in the diner reported
sick and was hurriedly replaced by a man who had
received a full and careful briefing on the telephone.
The chef swore there was something fishy, but the new
man said a word or two to him and the chef showed
the whites of his eyes and went silent, surreptitiously
touching the lucky bean that hung round his neck on
a string.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had walked quickly through the great glass-covered
concourse and through Gate 14 down to his
train.</p>

<p class="pindent">It lay, a quarter of a mile of silver carriages, quietly
in the dusk of the underground station. Up front, the
auxiliary generators of the 4000 horsepower twin Diesel
electric units ticked busily. Under the bare electric bulbs
the horizontal purple and gold bands, the colours of
the Seaboard Railroad, glowed regally on the streamlined
locomotives. The engineman and fireman who would
take the great train on the first two hundred mile lap
into the south lolled in the spotless aluminium cabin,
twelve feet above the track, watching the ammeter and
the air-pressure dial, ready to go.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was quiet in the great concrete cavern below the
city and every noise threw an echo.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were not many passengers. More would be
taken on at Newark, Philadelphia, Baltimore and
Washington. Bond walked a hundred yards, his feet
ringing on the empty platform, before he found Car
245, towards the rear of the train. A Pullman porter
stood at the door. He wore spectacles. His black face
was bored but friendly. Below the windows of the
carriage, in broad letters of brown and gold, was written
‘Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac’, and below
that ‘Bellesylvania’, the name of the Pullman car. A thin
wisp of steam rose from the couplings of the central
heating near the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Compartment H,’ said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mr Bryce, Suh? Yassuh. Mrs Bryce just come aboard.
Straight down da cyar.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stepped on to the train and turned down the
drab olive-green corridor. The carpet was thick. There
was the usual American train-smell of old cigar-smoke.
A notice said <span class="calibre4">NEED A SECOND PILLOW? FOR ANY
EXTRA COMFORT RING FOR YOUR PULLMAN ATTENDANT.
HIS NAME IS</span>, then a printed card, slipped in:
<span class="calibre4">SAMUEL D. BALDWIN</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">H was more than half way down the car. There was
a respectable-looking American couple in E, otherwise
the rooms were empty. The door of H was closed. He
tried it and it was locked.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Who’s that?’ asked a girl’s voice, anxiously.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s me,’ said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">The door opened. Bond walked through, put down
his bag and locked the door behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">She was in a black tailor-made. A wide-mesh veil
came down from the rim of a small black straw hat.
One gloved hand was up to her throat and through the
veil Bond could see that her face was pale and her eyes
were wide with fear. She looked rather French and very
beautiful.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thank God,’ she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gave a quick glance round the room. He opened
the lavatory door and looked in. It was empty.</p>

<p class="pindent">A voice on the platform outside called ‘Board!’ There
was a clang as the attendant pulled up the folding iron
step and shut the door and then the train was rolling
quietly down the track. A bell clanged monotonously
as they passed the automatic signals. There was a slight
clatter from the wheels as they crossed some points
and then the train began to accelerate. For better or for
worse, they were on their way.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Which seat would you like?’ asked Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I don’t mind,’ she said anxiously. ‘You choose.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shrugged and sat down with his back to the
engine. He preferred to face forwards.</p>

<p class="pindent">She sat down nervously, facing him. They were still
in the long tunnel that takes the Philadelphia lines out
of the city.</p>

<p class="pindent">She took off her hat and unpinned the broad-mesh
veil and put them on the seat beside her. She took some
hairpins out of the back of her hair and shook her
head so that the heavy black hair fell forward. There
were blue shadows under her eyes and Bond reflected
that she too must have gone without sleep that night.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a table between them. Suddenly she
reached forward and pulled his right hand towards her
on the table. She held it in both her hands and bent
forward and kissed it. Bond frowned and tried to pull
his hand away, but for a moment she held it tight in
both of hers.</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked up and her wide blue eyes looked candidly
into his.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thank you,’ she said. ‘Thank you for trusting me. It
was difficult for you.’ She released his hand and sat
back.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m glad I did,’ said Bond inadequately, his mind
trying to grapple with the mystery of this woman. He
dug in his pocket for his cigarettes and lighter. It was
a new pack of Chesterfields and with his right hand he
scrabbled at the Cellophane wrapper.</p>

<p class="pindent">She reached over and took the pack from him. She
slit it with her thumb-nail, took out a cigarette, lit it
and handed it to him. Bond took it from her and smiled
into her eyes, tasting the hint of lipstick from her
mouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I smoke about three packs a day,’ he said. ‘You’re
going to be busy.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ll just help with the new packs,’ she said. ‘Don’t be
afraid I’m going to fuss over you the whole way to St
Petersburg.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s eyes narrowed and the smile went out of
them.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You don’t believe I thought we were only going as
far as Washington,’ she said. ‘You weren’t very quick
on the telephone this morning. And anyway, Mr Big
was certain you would make for Florida. I heard him
warning his people down there about you. He spoke to
a man called “The Robber”, long distance. Said to watch
the airport at Tampa and the trains. Perhaps we ought
to get off the train earlier, at Tarpon Springs or one of
the small stations up the coast. Did they see you getting
on the train?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not that I know of,’ said Bond. His eyes had relaxed
again. ‘How about you? Have any trouble getting
away?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It was my day for a singing lesson. He’s trying to
make a torch singer out of me. Wants me to go on at
The Boneyard. One of his men took me to my teacher
as usual and was due to pick me up again at midday.
He wasn’t surprised I was having a lesson so early. I
often have breakfast with my teacher so as to get away
from Mr Big. He expects me to have all my meals with
him.’ She looked at her watch. He noted cynically that
it was an expensive one—diamonds and platinum, Bond
guessed. ‘They’ll be missing me in about an hour. I
waited until the car had gone, then I walked straight
out again and called you. Then I took a cab downtown.
I bought a toothbrush and a few other things at a
drugstore. Otherwise I’ve got nothing except my jewellery
and the mad money I’ve always kept hidden from
him. About five thousand dollars. So I won’t be a financial
burden.’ She smiled. ‘I thought I’d get my chance
one day.’ She gestured towards the window. ‘You’ve
given me a new life. I’ve been shut up with him and
his nigger gangsters for nearly a year. This is heaven.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The train was running through the unkempt barren
plains and swamps between New York and Trenton. It
wasn’t an attractive prospect. It reminded Bond of some
of the stretches on the pre-war Trans-Siberian Railway
except for the huge lonely hoardings advertising the
current Broadway shows and the occasional dumps of
scrap-iron and old motor cars.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I hope I can find you something better than that,’
he said, smiling. ‘But don’t thank me. We’re quits now.
You saved my life last night. That is,’ he added, looking
at her curiously, ‘if you really have got second sight.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ she said, ‘I have. Or something very like it. I
can often see what’s going to happen, particularly to
other people. Of course I embroider on it and when I
was earning my living doing it in Haiti it was easy to
turn it into a good cabaret act. They’re riddled with
Voodoo and superstitions there and they were quite
certain I was a witch. But I promise that when I first
saw you in that room I knew you had been sent to save
me. I,’ she blushed, ‘I saw all sorts of things.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What sort of things?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh I don’t know,’ she said, her eyes dancing. ‘Just
things. Anyway, we’ll see. But it’s going to be difficult,’
she added seriously, ‘and dangerous. For both of us.’ She
paused. ‘So will you please take good care of us?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ll do my best,’ said Bond. ‘The first thing is for us
both to get some sleep. Let’s have a drink and some
chicken sandwiches and then we’ll get the porter to put
our beds down. You mustn’t be embarrassed,’ he added,
seeing her eyes recoil. ‘We’re in this together. We have
to spend twenty-four hours in a double bedroom
together, and it’s no good being squeamish. Anyway,
you’re Mrs Bryce,’ he grinned, ‘and you must just act
like her. Up to a point anyway,’ he added.</p>

<p class="pindent">She laughed. Her eyes speculated. She said nothing
but rang the bell below the window.</p>

<p class="pindent">The conductor arrived at the same time as the
Pullman attendant. Bond ordered Old Fashioneds, and
stipulated Old Granddad Bourbon, chicken sandwiches,
and decaffeined Sanka coffee so that their sleep would
not be spoilt.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I have to collect another fare from you, Mr Bryce,’
said the conductor.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course,’ said Bond. Solitaire made a movement
towards her handbag. ‘It’s all right, darling,’ said Bond,
pulling out his notecase. ‘You’ve forgotten you gave me
your money to look after before we left the house.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Guess the lady’ll need plenty for her summer frocks,’
said the conductor. ‘Shops is plenty expensive in St
Pete. Plenty hot down there too. You folks been to
Florida before?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We always go at this time of year,’ said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hope you have a pleasant trip,’ said the conductor.</p>

<p class="pindent">When the door shut behind him, Solitaire laughed
delightedly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You can’t embarrass me,’ she said. ‘I’ll think up something
really fierce if you’re not careful. To begin with,
I’m going in there,’ she gestured towards the door
behind Bond’s head. ‘I must look terrible.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Go ahead, darling,’ laughed Bond as she disappeared.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned to the window and watched the pretty
clapboard houses slip by as they approached Trenton.
He loved trains and he looked forward with excitement
to the rest of the journey.</p>

<p class="pindent">The train was slowing down. They slid past sidings
full of empty freight cars bearing names from all over
the States—‘Lackawanna’, ‘Chesapeake and Ohio’,
‘Lehigh Valley’, ‘Seaboard Fruit Express’, and the lilting
‘Acheson, Topeka and Santa Fe’—names that held all
the romance of the American railroads.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘British Railways?’ thought Bond. He sighed and
turned his thoughts back to the present adventure.</p>

<p class="pindent">For better or worse he had decided to accept Solitaire,
or rather, in his cold way, to make the most of
her. There were many questions to be answered but
now was not the time to ask them. All that immediately
concerned him was that another blow had been
struck at Mr Big—where it would hurt most, in his
vanity.</p>

<p class="pindent">As for the girl, as a girl, he reflected that it was going
to be fun teasing her and being teased back and he was
glad that they had already crossed the frontiers into
comradeship and even intimacy.</p>

<p class="pindent">Was it true what The Big Man had said, that she
would have nothing to do with men? He doubted it.
She seemed open to love and to desire. At any rate he
knew she was not closed to him. He wanted her to
come back and sit down opposite him again so that he
could look at her and play with her and slowly discover
her. Solitaire. It was an attractive name. No wonder they
had christened her that in the sleazy nightclubs of Port
au Prince. Even in her present promise of warmth
towards him there was much that was withdrawn and
mysterious. He sensed a lonely childhood on some great
decaying plantation, an echoing ‘Great House’ slowly
falling into disrepair and being encroached on by the
luxuriance of the tropics. The parents dying, and the
property being sold. The companionship of a servant
or two and an equivocal life in lodgings in the capital.
The beauty which was her only asset and the struggle
against the shady propositions to be a ‘governess’, a
‘companion’, a ‘secretary’, all of which meant respectable
prostitution. Then the dubious, unknown steps
into the world of entertainment. The evening stint at
the nightclub with the mysterious act which, among
people dominated by magic, must have kept many away
from her and made her a person to be feared. And
then, one evening, the huge man with the grey face
sitting at a table by himself. The promise that he would
put her on Broadway. The chance of a new life, of an
escape from the heat and the dirt and the solitude.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned brusquely away from the window. A
romantic picture, perhaps. But it must have been something
like that.</p>

<p class="pindent">He heard the door unlock. The girl came back and
slid into the seat opposite him. She looked fresh and
gay. She examined him carefully.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You have been wondering about me,’ she said. ‘I felt
it. Don’t worry. There is nothing very bad to know. I
will tell you all about it some day. When we have time.
Now I want to forget about the past. I will just tell you
my real name. It is Simone Latrelle, but you can call
me what you like. I am twenty-five. And now I am
happy. I like this little room. But I am hungry and sleepy.
Which bed will you have?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled at the question. He reflected.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s not very gallant,’ he said, ‘but I think I’d better
have the bottom one. I’d rather be close to the floor—just
in case. Not that there’s anything to worry about,’
he added, seeing her frown, ‘but Mr Big seems to have
a pretty long arm, particularly in the negro world. And
that includes the railroads. Do you mind?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course not,’ she said. ‘I was going to suggest it.
And you couldn’t climb into the top one with your poor
hand.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Their lunch arrived, brought from the diner by a
preoccupied negro waiter. He seemed anxious to be
paid and get back to his work.</p>

<p class="pindent">When they had finished and Bond rang for the
Pullman porter, he also seemed distrait and avoided
looking at Bond. He took his time getting the beds
made up. He made much show of not having enough
room to move around in.</p>

<p class="pindent">Finally, he seemed to pluck up courage.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Praps Mistress Bryce like set down nex’ door while
Ah git the room fixed,’ he said, looking over Bond’s
head. ‘Nex’ room goin’ to be empty all way to St Pete.’
He took out a key and unlocked the communicating
door without waiting for Bond’s reply.</p>

<p class="pindent">At a gesture from Bond, Solitaire took the hint. He
heard her lock the door into the corridor. The negro
bumped the communicating door shut.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond waited for a moment. He remembered the
negro’s name.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Got something on your mind, Baldwin?’ he asked.</p>

<p class="pindent">Relieved, the attendant turned and looked straight at
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sho’ have, Mister Bryce. Yassuh.’ Once started, the
words came in a torment. ‘Shouldn be tellin’ yuh this,
Mister Bryce, but dere’s plenty trouble ’n this train this
trip. Yuh gotten yourself a henemy ’n dis train, Mister
Bryce. Yassuh. Ah hears tings which Ah don’ like at all.
Cain’t say much. Get mahself ’n plenty trouble. But yuh
all want to watch yo step plenty good. Yassuh. Certain
party got da finger ’n yuh, Mister Bryce, ’n dat man is
bad news. Better take dese hyah,’ he reached in his
pocket and brought out two wooden window wedges.
‘Push dem under the doors,’ he said. ‘Ah cain’t do nuthen
else. Git mah throat cut. But Ah don’ like any foolin’
aroun’ wid da customers ’n my cyar. Nossuh.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took the wedges from him. ‘But . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Cain’t help yuh no more, Sah,’ said the negro with
finality, his hand on the door. ‘Ef yuh ring fo me dis
evenin’, Ah’ll fetch yo dinner. Doan yuh go lettin’ any
person else in the room.’</p>

<p class="pindent">His hand came out to take the twenty-dollar bill. He
crumpled it into his pocket.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ah’ll do all Ah can, Sah,’ he said. ‘But dey’ll git me
ef Ah don’t watch it. Sho will.’ He went out and quickly
shut the door behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond thought for a moment, then he opened the
communicating door. Solitaire was reading.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He’s fixed everything,’ he said. ‘Took a long time
about it. Wanted to tell me all his life-story as well. I’ll
keep out of your way until you’ve climbed up to your
nest. Call me when you’re ready.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He sat down next door in the seat she had left and
watched the grim suburbs of Philadelphia showing their
sores, like beggars, to the rich train.</p>

<p class="pindent">No object in frightening her until it had to be. But
the new threat had come sooner than he expected, and
her danger if the watcher on the train discovered her
identity would be as great as his.</p>

<p class="pindent">She called and he went in.</p>

<p class="pindent">The room was in darkness save for his bed-light,
which she had turned on.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sleep well,’ she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got out of his coat. He quietly slipped the
wedges firmly under both doors. Then he lay down
carefully on his right side on the comfortable bed and
without a thought for the future fell into a deep sleep,
lulled by the pounding gallop of the train.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">A few cars away, in the deserted diner, a negro waiter
read again what he had written on a telegraph blank
and waited for the ten-minute stop at Philadelphia.</p>
