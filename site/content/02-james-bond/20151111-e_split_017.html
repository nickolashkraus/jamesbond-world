<p class="pindent">Around six Bond packed his bag and paid the check.
Mrs Stuyvesant was glad to see the last of him. The
Everglades hadn’t experienced such alarums since the
last hurricane.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter’s car was back on the Boulevard and he drove
it over to the town. He visited a hardware store and
made various purchases. Then he had the biggest steak,
rare, with French fries, he had ever seen. It was a small
grill called Pete’s, dark and friendly. He drank a quarter
of a pint of Old Granddad with the steak and had two
cups of very strong coffee. With all this under his belt
he began to feel more sanguine.</p>

<p class="pindent">He spun out the meal and the drinks until nine
o’clock. Then he studied a map of the city and took
the car and made a wide detour that brought him within
a block of The Robber’s wharf from the south. He ran
the car down to the sea and got out.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a bright moonlit night and the buildings and
warehouses threw great blocks of indigo shadow. The
whole section seemed deserted and there was no sound
except the quiet lapping of the small waves against the
sea-wall and water gurgling under the empty wharves.</p>

<p class="pindent">The top of the low sea-wall was about three feet
wide. It was in shadow for the hundred yards or more
that separated him from the long black outline of the
Ourobouros warehouse.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond climbed on to it and walked carefully and
silently along between the buildings and the sea. As he
got nearer a steady, high-pitched whine became louder,
and by the time he dropped down on the wide cement
parking space at the back of the building it was a muted
scream. Bond had expected something of the sort. The
noise came from the air-pumps and heating systems
which he knew would be necessary to keep the fish
healthy through the chill of the night hours. He had
also relied on the fact that most of the roof would
certainly be of glass to admit sunlight during the day.
Also that there would be good ventilation.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was not disappointed. The whole of the south
wall of the warehouse, from just above the level of
his head, was of plate glass, and through it he could
see the moonlight shining down through half an acre
of glass roofing. High up above him, and well out of
reach, broad windows were open to the night air. There
was, as he and Leiter had expected, a small door low
down, but it was locked and bolted and leaded wires
near the hinges suggested some form of burglar-alarm.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was not interested in the door. Following his
hunch, he had come equipped for an entry through
glass. He cast about for something that would raise him
an extra two feet. In a land where litter and junk are
so much a part of the landscape he soon found what
he wanted. It was a discarded heavy gauge tyre. He
rolled it to the wall of the warehouse away from the
door and took off his shoes.</p>

<p class="pindent">He put bricks against the bottom edges of the tyre
to hold it steady and hoisted himself up. The steady
scream of the pumps gave him protection and he at
once set to work with a small glass-cutter which he had
bought, together with a hunk of putty, on his way to
dinner. When he had cut down the two vertical sides
of one of the yard-square panes, he pressed the putty
against the centre of the glass and worked it to a
protruding knob. He then went to work on the lateral
edges of the pane.</p>

<p class="pindent">While he worked he gazed through into the moonlit
vistas of the huge repository. The endless rows of tanks
stood on wooden trestles with narrow passages between.
Down the centre of the building there was a wider
passage. Under the trestles Bond could see long tanks
and trays let into the floor. Just below him, broad racks
covered with regiments of sea-shells jutted out from the
walls. Most of the tanks were dark but in some a tiny
strip of electric light glimmered spectrally and glinted
on little fountains of bubbles rising from the weeds
and sand. There was a light metal runway suspended
from the roof over each row of tanks and Bond guessed
that any individual tank could be lifted out and brought
to the exit for shipment or to extract sick fish for quarantine.
It was a window into a queer world and into a
queer business. It was odd to think of all the worms
and eels and fish stirring quietly in the night, the thousands
of gills sighing and the multitude of antennae
waving and pointing and transmitting their tiny radar
signals to the dozing nerve-centres.</p>

<p class="pindent">After a quarter of an hour’s meticulous work there
was a slight cracking noise and the pane came away
attached to the putty knob in his hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">He climbed down and put the pane carefully on the
ground away from the tyre. Then he stuffed his shoes
inside his shirt. With only one good hand they might
be vital weapons. He listened. There was no sound but
the unfaltering whine of the pumps. He looked up to
see if by chance there were any clouds about to cross
the moon but the sky was empty save for its canopy
of brightly burning stars. He got back on top of the
tyre and with an easy heave half of his body was through
the wide hole he had made.</p>

<p class="pindent">He turned and grasped the metal frame above his
head and, putting all his weight on his arms, he jackknifed
his legs through and down so that they were
hanging a few inches above the racks full of shells. He
lowered himself until he could feel the backs of the
shells with his stockinged toes, then he softly separated
them with his toes until he had exposed a width of
board. Then he let his whole weight subside softly on
to the tray. It held, and in a moment he was down on
the floor listening with all his senses for any noise behind
the whine of the machinery.</p>

<p class="pindent">But there was none. He took his steel-tipped shoes
out of his shirt and left them on the cleared board,
then he moved off on the concrete floor with a pencil
flashlight in his hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was in the aquarium-fish section, and as he examined
the labels he caught flashes of coloured light from
the deep tanks and occasionally a piece of living jewellery
would materialize and briefly goggle at him before
he moved on.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were all kinds—Swordtails, Guppies, Platys,
Terras, Neons, Cichlids, Labyrinth and Paradise fish,
and every variety of exotic Goldfish. Underneath, sunk
in the floor, and most of them covered with chicken
wire, there were tray upon tray swarming and heaving
with worms and baits: white worms, micro worms,
Daphnia, shrimp and thick slimy clam worms. From
these ground tanks, forests of tiny eyes looked up at
his torch.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was the foetid smell of a mangrove swamp in
the air and the temperature was in the high seventies.
Soon Bond began to sweat slightly and to long for the
clean night air.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had moved to the central passage-way before he
found the poison fish which were one of his objectives.
When he had read about them in the files of the Police
Headquarters in New York, he had made a mental note
that he would like to know more about this sideline of
the peculiar business of Ourobouros Inc.</p>

<p class="pindent">Here the tanks were smaller and there was generally
only one specimen in each. Here the eyes that looked
sluggishly at Bond were cold and hooded and an occasional
fang was bared at the torch or a spined backbone
slowly swelled.</p>

<p class="pindent">Each tank bore an ominous skull-and-crossbones in
chalk and there were large labels that said <span class="calibre4">VERY
DANGEROUS</span> and <span class="calibre4">KEEP OFF</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">There must have been at least a hundred tanks of
various sizes, from the large ones to hold Torpedo
Skates and the sinister Guitar Fish, to smaller ones for
the Horse-killer Eel, Mud Fish from the Pacific, and
the monstrous West Indian Scorpion Fish, each of
whose spines has a poison sac as powerful as a rattlesnake’s
venom.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s eyes narrowed as he noticed that in all the
dangerous tanks the mud or sand on the bottom occupied
nearly half the tank.</p>

<p class="pindent">He chose a tank containing a six-inch Scorpion Fish.
He knew something of the habits of this deadly species
and in particular that they do not strike, but poison
only on contact.</p>

<p class="pindent">The top of the tank was on a level with his waist.
He took out a strong pocket-knife he had purchased
and opened the longest blade. Then he leant over the
tank and with his sleeve rolled up he deliberately aimed
his knife at the centre of the craggy head between the
overhung grottoes of the eye-sockets. As his hand broke
the surface of the water the white dinosaur spines stood
threateningly erect and the mottled stripes of the fish
turned to a uniform muddy brown. Its broad, wing-like
pectorals rose slightly, poised for flight.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond lunged swiftly, correcting his aim for the refraction
from the surface of the tank. He pinned the bulging
head down as the tail threshed wildly and slowly drew
the fish towards him and up the glass side of the tank.
He stood aside and whipped it out on to the floor,
where it continued flapping and jumping despite its
shattered skull.</p>

<p class="pindent">He leant over the tank and plunged his hand deep
into the centre of the mud and sand.</p>

<p class="pindent">Yes, they were there. His hunch about the poison fish
had been right. His fingers felt the close rows of coin
deep under the mud, like counters in a box. They were
in a flat tray. He could feel the wooden partitions. He
pulled out a coin, rinsing it and his hand in the cleaner
surface water as he did so. He shone his torch on it. It
was as big as a modern five-shilling piece, and nearly
as thick, and it was gold. It bore the arms of Spain and
the head of Philip II.</p>

<p class="pindent">He looked at the tank, measuring it. There must be
a thousand coins in this one tank that no customs
officer would think of disturbing. Ten to twenty thousand
dollars’ worth, guarded by one poison-fanged
Cerberus. These must be the cargo brought in by the
<span class="it">Secatur</span> on her last trip a week ago. A hundred tanks.
Say one hundred and fifty thousand dollars’ worth of
gold per trip. Soon the trucks would be coming for
the tanks and somewhere down the road men with
rubber-coated tongs would extract the deadly fish and
throw them back in the sea or burn them. The water
and the mud would be emptied out and the gold coin
washed and poured into bags. Then the bags would
go to agents and the coins would trickle out on the
market, each one strictly accounted for by Mr Big’s
machine.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a scheme after Mr Big’s philosophy, effective,
technically brilliant, almost foolproof.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was full of admiration as he bent to the floor
and speared the Scorpion Fish in the side. He dropped
it back in the tank. There was no point in divulging his
knowledge to the enemy.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was as he turned away from the tank that all the
lights in the warehouse suddenly blazed on and a voice
of sharp authority said, ‘Don’t move an inch. Stick ’em
up.’</p>

<p class="pindent">As Bond took a rolling dive under the tank he caught
a glimpse of the lank figure of The Robber squinting
down the sights of his rifle about twenty yards away,
up against the main entrance. As he dived he prayed
that The Robber would miss, but also he prayed that
the floor tank which was to take his dive would be one
of the covered ones. It was. It was covered with chicken
wire. Something snapped up at him as he hit the wire
and sprawled clear in the next passage-way. As he dived,
the rifle cracked and the Scorpion Fish tank above his
head splintered sharply and water gushed down.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sprinted fast between the tanks back towards
his only means of retreat. Just as he turned the corner
there was a shot and a tank of angel fish exploded like
a bomb just beside his ear.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was now at his end of the warehouse with The
Robber at the other, fifty yards away. There was no
possible chance of jumping for his window on the other
side of the central passage-way. He stood for a moment
gaining his breath and thinking. He realized that the
lines of tanks would only protect him to the knees and
that between the tanks he would be in full view down
the narrow passages. Either way, he could not stand
still. He was reminded of the fact as a shot whammed
between his legs into a pile of conchs, sending splinters
of their hard china buzzing round him like wasps. He
ran to his right and another shot came at his legs. It hit
the floor and zoomed into a huge carboy of clams that
split in half and emptied a hundred shell-fish over the
floor. Bond raced back, taking long quick strides. He
had his Beretta out and loosed off two shots as he
crossed the central passage-way. He saw The Robber
jump for shelter as a tank shattered above his head.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond grinned as he heard a shout drowned by the
crash of glass and water.</p>

<p class="pindent">He immediately dropped to one knee and fired two
shots at The Robber’s legs, but fifty yards for his small-calibre
pistol was too much. There was the crash of
another tank but the second shot clanged emptily into
the iron entrance gates.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then The Robber was shooting again and Bond could
only dodge to and fro behind the cases and wait to be
caught in the kneecap. Occasionally he fired a shot in
return to make The Robber keep his distance, but he
knew the battle was lost. The other man seemed to
have endless ammunition. Bond had only two shots left
in his gun and one fresh clip in his pocket.</p>

<p class="pindent">As he shuttled to and fro, slipping on the rare fish
that flapped wildly on the concrete, he even stooped
to snatching up heavy queen conchs and helmet shells
and hurling them towards the enemy. Often they burst
impressively on top of some tank at The Robber’s end
and added to the appalling racket inside the corrugated-iron
shed. But they were quite ineffective. He thought
of shooting out the lights, but there were at least twenty
of them in two rows.</p>

<p class="pindent">Finally Bond decided to give up. He had one ruse to
fall back on, and any change in the battle was better
than exhausting himself at the wrong end of this deadly
coconut-shy.</p>

<p class="pindent">As he passed a row of cases of which the one near
him was shattered, he pushed it on to the floor. It was
still half full of rare Siamese Fighting Fish, and Bond
was pleased with the expensive crash as the remains of
the tank burst in fragments on the floor. A wide space
was cleared on the trestle table, and after making two
quick darts to pick up his shoes he dashed back to the
table and jumped up.</p>

<p class="pindent">With no target for The Robber to shoot at there was
a moment’s silence save for the whine of the pumps,
the sound of water dripping out of broken tanks and
the flapping of dying fish. Bond slipped his shoes on
and laced them tight.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hey, Limey,’ called The Robber patiently. ‘Come on
out or I start using pineapples. I been expectin’ you an’
I got plenty ammo.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Guess I got to give up,’ answered Bond through
cupped hands. ‘But only because you smashed one of
my ankles.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ll not shoot,’ called The Robber. ‘Drop your gun
on the floor and come down the central passage with
your hands up. We’ll have a quiet little talk.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Guess I got no option,’ said Bond, putting hopelessness
into his voice. He dropped his Beretta with a clatter
on to the cement floor. He took the gold coin out of
his pocket and clenched it in his bandaged left hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond groaned as he put his feet to the floor. He
dragged his left leg behind him as he limped heavily up
the central passage, his hands held level with his shoulders.
He stopped half way up the passage.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Robber came slowly towards him, half-crouching,
his rifle pointed at Bond’s stomach. Bond was glad to
see that his shirt was soaked and that he had a cut over
his left eye.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Robber walked well to the left of the passage-way.
When he was about ten yards away from Bond he
paused with one stockinged foot casually resting on a
small obstruction in the cement floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">He gestured with his rifle. ‘Higher,’ he said harshly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond groaned and lifted his hands a few inches so
that they were almost across his face, as if in defence.</p>

<p class="pindent">Between the fingers he saw The Robber’s toes kick
something sharply sideways and there was a faint clang
as if a bolt had been drawn. Bond’s eyes glinted behind
his hands and his jaw tightened. He knew now what
had happened to Leiter.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Robber came on, his hard, thin frame obscuring
the spot where he had paused.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Christ,’ said Bond, ‘I gotta sit down. My leg won’t
hold me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Robber stopped a few feet away. ‘Go ahead and
stand while I ask you a few questions, Limey.’ He bared
his tobacco-stained teeth. ‘You’ll soon be lying down,
and for keeps.’ The Robber stood and looked him over.
Bond sagged. Behind the defeat in his face his brain
was measuring in inches.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nosey bastard,’ said The Robber . . .</p>

<p class="pindent">At that moment Bond dropped the gold coin out of
his left hand. It clanged on the cement floor and started
to roll.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the fraction of a second that The Robber’s eyes
flickered down, Bond’s right foot in its steel-capped shoe
lashed out to its full length. It kicked the rifle almost out
of The Robber’s hands. At the same moment that The
Robber pulled the trigger and the bullet crashed harmlessly
through the glass ceiling, Bond launched himself
in a dive at the man’s stomach, his two arms flailing.</p>

<p class="pindent">Both hands connected with something soft and
brought a grunt of agony. Pain shot through Bond’s
left hand and he winced as the rifle crashed down across
his back. He bore on into the man, blind to pain, hitting
with both hands, his head down between hunched
shoulders, forcing the man back and off his balance. As
he felt the balance yield he straightened himself slightly
and lashed out again with his steel-capped foot. It
connected with The Robber’s kneecap. There was a
scream of agony and the rifle clattered to the ground
as The Robber tried to save himself. He was half way
to the floor when Bond’s uppercut hit him and projected
the body another few feet.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Robber fell in the centre of the passage just
opposite what Bond could now see was a drawn bolt
in the floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">As the body hit the ground a section of the floor
turned swiftly on a central pivot and the body almost
disappeared down the black opening of a wide trap-door
in the concrete.</p>

<p class="pindent">As he felt the floor give under his weight The Robber
gave a shrill scream of terror and his hands scrabbled
for a hold. They caught the edge of the floor and
clutched it just as his whole body slid into space and the
six-foot panel of reinforced concrete revolved smoothly
until it rested upright on its pivot, a black rectangle
yawning on either side.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gasped for air. He put his hands on his hips
and got back some of his breath. Then he walked to
the edge of the right-hand hole and looked down.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Robber’s terrified face, the lips drawn back from
the teeth and the eyes madly distended, jabbered up at
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Looking beyond him, Bond could see nothing, but
he heard the lapping of water against the foundations
of the building and there was a faint luminescence on
the seaward side. Bond guessed that there was access
to the sea through wire or narrow bars.</p>

<p class="pindent">As The Robber’s voice died down to a whimper, Bond
could hear something stirring down there, awoken by
the light. A Hammerhead or a Tiger Shark, he guessed,
with their sharper reactions.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Pull me out, friend. Give me a break. Pull me out.
I can’t hold much longer. I’ll do anything you want. Tell
you anything.’ The Robber’s voice was a hoarse whisper
of supplication.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What happened to Solitaire?’ Bond stared down into
the frenzied eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The Big Man did it. Told me to fix a snatch. Two
men in Tampa. Ask for Butch and The Lifer. Poolroom
behind the Oasis. She came to no harm. Lemme out,
pal.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And the American, Leiter?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The agonized face pleaded. ‘It was his fault. Called
me out early this mornin’. Said the place was on fire.
Seen it passing in his car. Held me up and brought me
back in here. Wanted to search the place. Just fell
through the trap. Accident. I swear it was his fault. We
pulled him out before he was finished. He’ll be okay.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked down coldly at the white fingers desperately
clinging to the sharp edge of concrete. He knew
that The Robber must have got the bolt back and
somehow engineered Leiter over the trap. He could
hear the man’s laugh of triumph as the floor swung
open, could see the cruel smile as he pencilled the note
and stuck it into the bandages when they had fished
the half-eaten body out.</p>

<p class="pindent">For a moment blind rage seized him.</p>

<p class="pindent">He kicked out sharply, twice.</p>

<p class="pindent">One short scream came up out of the depths. There
was a splash and then a great commotion in the
water.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked to the side of the trap-door and pushed
the upright concrete slab. It revolved easily on its central
pivot.</p>

<p class="pindent">Just before its edges shut out the blackness below,
Bond heard one terrible snuffling grunt as if a great
pig was getting its mouth full. He knew it for the grunt
that a shark makes as its hideous flat nose comes up
out of the water and its sickle-shaped mouth closes on
a floating carcass. He shuddered and kicked the bolt
home with his foot.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond collected the gold coin off the floor and picked
up his Beretta. He went to the main entrance and looked
back for a moment at the shambles of the battlefield.</p>

<p class="pindent">He reflected that there was nothing to show that
the secret of the treasure had been discovered. The
top had been shot off the Scorpion Fish tank under
which Bond had dived, and when the other men came
in the morning they would not be surprised to find
the fish dead in the tank. They would get the remains
of The Robber out of the shark tank and report to
Mr Big that he’d been worsted in a gun battle and
that there were X thousand dollars’ worth of damage
which would have to be repaired before the <span class="it">Secatur</span>
could bring over its next cargo. They would find some
of Bond’s bullets and soon guess that it was his
work.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond grimly shut his mind to the horror beneath the
floor of the warehouse. He turned off the lights and
let himself out by the main entrance.</p>

<p class="pindent">A small payment had been made on account of Solitaire
and Leiter.</p>
