<p class="pindent">Bond looked at the telephone, then he got up and
walked over to the sideboard. He put a handful of
wilted ice-cubes into a tall glass, poured in three inches
of Haig and Haig and swilled the mixture round in
the glass to cool and dilute it. Then he drank down
half the glass in one long swallow. He put the glass
down and eased himself out of his coat. His left hand
was so swollen that he could only just get it through
the sleeve. His little finger was still crooked back
and the pain was vicious as it scraped against the cloth.
The finger was nearly black. He pulled down his tie
and undid the top of his shirt. Then he picked up his
glass, took another deep swallow, and walked back to
the telephone.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter answered at once.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thank God,’ said Leiter with real feeling. ‘What’s the
damage?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Broken finger,’ said Bond. ‘How about you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Blackjack. Knocked out. Nothing serious. They
started off by considering all sorts of ingenious things.
Wanted to couple me to the compressed-air pump in
the garage. Start on the ears and then proceed elsewhere.
When no instructions came from The Big Man they
got bored and I got to arguing the finer points of Jazz
with Blabbermouth, the man with the fancy six-shooter.
We got on to Duke Ellington and agreed that we liked
our band-leaders to be percussion men, not wind. We
agreed the piano or the drums held the band together
better than any other solo instrument—Jelly Roll
Morton, for instance. Apropos the Duke, I told him
the crack about the clarinet—“an ill woodwind that
nobody blows good”. That made him laugh fit to bust.
Suddenly we were friends. The other man—The Flannel,
he was called—got sour and Blabbermouth told him
he could go off duty, he’d look after me. Then The Big
Man rang down.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I was there,’ said Bond. ‘It didn’t sound so hot.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Blabbermouth was worried as hell. He wandered
round the room talking to himself. Suddenly he used
the blackjack, hard, and I went out. Next thing I knew
we were outside Bellevue Hospital. About half after
three. Blabbermouth was very apologetic, said it was
the least he could have done. I believe him. He begged
me not to give him away. Said he was going to report
that he’d left me half dead. Of course I promised to
leak back some very lurid details. We parted on the best
of terms. I got some treatment at the Emergency ward
and came home. I was worried to hell an’ gone about
you, but after a while the telephone started ringing.
Police and FBI. Seems The Big Man has complained
that some fool Limey went berserk at The Boneyard
early this morning, shot three of his men—two
chauffeurs and a waiter, if you please—stole one of his
cars and got away, leaving his overcoat and hat in the
cloakroom. The Big Man’s yelling for action. Of course
I warned off the dicks and the FBI, but they’re madder’n
hell and we’ve got to get out of town at once. It’ll miss
the mornings but it’ll be splashed all over the afternoon
blatts and radio and TV’ll have it. Apart from all that,
Mr Big will be after you like a nest of hornets. Anyway,
I’ve got some plans fixed. Now you tell, and God, am
I glad to hear your voice!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gave a detailed account of all that had happened.
He forgot nothing. When he had finished, Leiter gave
a low whistle.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Boy,’ he said with admiration. ‘You certainly made a
dent in The Big Man’s machine. But were you lucky.
That Solitaire dame certainly seems to have saved your
bacon. D’you think we can use her?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Could if we could get near her,’ said Bond. ‘I should
think he keeps her pretty close.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We’ll have to think about that another day,’ said Leiter.
‘Now we’d better get moving. I’ll hang up and call you
back in a few minutes. First I’ll get the police surgeon
round to you right away. Be along in a quarter of an
hour or so. Then I’ll talk to the Commissioner myself
and sort out some of the police angles. They can stall
a bit by discovering the car. The FBI’ll have to tip off
the radio and newspaper boys so that at least we can
keep your name out of it and all this Limey talk. Otherwise
we shall have the British Ambassador being hauled
out of bed and parades by the National Association for
the Advancement of Colored People and God knows
what all.’ Leiter chuckled down the telephone. ‘Better
have a word with your chief in London. It’s about half
after ten their time. You’ll need a bit of protection. I
can look after the CIA, but the FBI have got a bad
attack of “see-here-young-man” this morning. You’ll
need some more clothes. I’ll see to that. Keep awake.
We’ll get plenty of sleep in the grave. Be calling you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He hung up. Bond smiled to himself. Hearing Leiter’s
cheerful voice and knowing everything was being taken
care of had wiped away his exhaustion and his black
memories.</p>

<p class="pindent">He picked up the telephone and talked to the Overseas
operator. Ten minutes’ delay, she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked into his bedroom and somehow got
out of his clothes. He gave himself a very hot shower
and then an ice-cold one. He shaved and managed to
pull on a clean shirt and trousers. He put a fresh clip
in his Beretta and wrapped the Colt in his discarded
shirt and put it in his suitcase. He was half way through
his packing when the telephone rang.</p>

<p class="pindent">He listened to the zing and echo on the line, the
chatter of distant operators, the patches of Morse from
aircraft and ships at sea, quickly suppressed. He could
see the big, grey building near Regent’s Park and imagine
the busy switchboard and the cups of tea and a girl
saying, ‘Yes, this is Universal Export,’ the address Bond
had asked for, one of the covers used by agents for
emergency calls on open lines from abroad. She would
tell the Supervisor, who would take the call over.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’re connected, caller,’ said the Overseas operator.
‘Go ahead, please. New York calling London.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond heard the calm English voice. ‘Universal Export.
Who’s speaking, please?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Can I speak to the Managing Director?’ said Bond.
‘This is his nephew James speaking from New York.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Just a moment, please.’ Bond could follow the call
to Miss Moneypenny and see her press the switch on
the intercom. ‘It’s New York, Sir,’ she would say. ‘I think
it’s 007.’ ‘Put him through,’ M would say.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes?’ said the cold voice that Bond loved and
obeyed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s James, Sir,’ said Bond. ‘I may need a bit of help
over a difficult consignment.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Go ahead,’ said the voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I went uptown to see our chief customer last night,’
said Bond. ‘Three of his best men went sick while I
was there.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How sick?’ asked the voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘As sick as can be, Sir,’ said Bond. ‘There’s a lot of
’flu about.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hope you didn’t catch any.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ve got a slight chill, Sir,’ said Bond, ‘but absolutely
nothing to worry about. I’ll write to you about it. The
trouble is that with all this ’flu about Federated think I
will do better out of town.’ (Bond chuckled to himself
at the thought of M’s grin.) ‘So I’m off right away with
Felicia.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Who?’ asked M.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Felicia,’ Bond spelled it out. ‘My new secretary from
Washington.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, yes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thought I’d try that factory you advised at San
Pedro.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good idea.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But Federated may have other ideas and I hoped
you’d give me your support.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I quite understand,’ said M. ‘How’s business?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Rather promising, Sir. But tough going. Felicia will
be typing my full report today.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good,’ said M. ‘Anything else?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No, that’s all, Sir. Thanks for your support.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s all right. Keep fit. Goodbye.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Goodbye, Sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond put down the telephone. He grinned. He could
imagine M calling in the Chief of Staff. ‘007’s already
tangled up with the FBI. Dam’ fool went up to Harlem
last night and bumped off three of Mr Big’s men. Got
hurt himself, apparently, but not much. Got to get out
of town with Leiter, the CIA man. Going down to St
Petersburg. Better warn A and C. Expect we’ll have
Washington round our ears before the day’s over. Tell
A to say I fully sympathize, but that 007 has my full
confidence and I’m sure he acted in self-defence. Won’t
happen again, and so forth. Got that?’ Bond grinned
again as he thought of Damon’s exasperation at having
to dish out a lot of soft soap to Washington when he
probably had plenty of other Anglo-American snarls
to disentangle.</p>

<p class="pindent">The telephone rang. It was Leiter again.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now listen,’ he said. ‘Everybody’s calming down
somewhat. Seems the men you got were a pretty nasty
trio—Tee-Hee Johnson, Sam Miami and a man called
McThing. All wanted on various counts. The FBI’s
covering up for you. Reluctantly, of course, and the Police
are stalling like mad. The FBI big brass had already asked
my Chief for you to be sent home—got him out of
bed, if you please—mostly jealousy, I guess—but we’ve
killed all that. Same time, we’ve both got to quit town at
once. That’s all fixed too. We can’t go together, so you’re
taking the train and I’ll fly. Jot this down.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond cradled the telephone against his shoulder and
reached for a pencil and paper. ‘Go ahead,’ he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Pennsylvania Station. Track 14. Ten-thirty this
morning. “The Silver Phantom”. Through train to St
Petersburg via Washington, Jacksonville and Tampa.
I’ve got you a compartment. Very luxurious. Car 245,
Compartment H. Ticket’ll be on the train. Conductor
will have it. In the name of Bryce. Just go to Gate 14
and down to the train. Then straight to your compartment
and lock yourself in till the train starts. I’m flying
down in an hour by Eastern, so you’ll be alone from
now on. If you get stuck call Dexter, but don’t be
surprised if he bites your head off. Train gets in around
midday tomorrow. Take a cab and go to The Everglades
Cabanas, Gulf Boulevard West, on Sunset Beach. That’s
on a place called Treasure Island where all the beach
hotels are. Connected with St Petersburg by a causeway.
Cabby’ll know it.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ll be waiting for you. Got all that? And for God’s
sake watch out. And I mean it. The Big Man’ll get you
if he possibly can and a police escort to the train would
only put the finger on you. Take a cab and keep out of
sight. I’m sending you up another hat and a fawn raincoat.
The check’s taken care of at the St Regis. That’s
the lot. Any questions?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sounds fine,’ said Bond. ‘I’ve talked to M and he’ll
square Washington if there’s any trouble. Look after
yourself too,’ he added. ‘You’ll be next on the list after
me. See you tomorrow. So long.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ll watch out,’ said Leiter. ‘ ’Bye.’</p>

<p class="pindent">It was half-past six and Bond pulled back the curtains
in the sitting-room and watched the dawn come up over
the city. It was still dark down in the caverns below but the
tips of the great concrete stalagmites were pink and the
sun lit up the windows floor by floor as if an army of
descending janitors was at work in the buildings.</p>

<p class="pindent">The police surgeon came, stayed for a painful quarter
of an hour and left.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Clean fracture,’ he had said. ‘Take a few days to heal.
How did you come by it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Caught it in a door,’ said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You ought to keep away from doors,’ commented
the surgeon. ‘They’re dangerous things. Ought to be
forbidden by law. Lucky you didn’t catch your neck in
this one.’</p>

<p class="pindent">When he had gone, Bond finished packing. He was
wondering how soon he could order breakfast when
the telephone rang.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was expecting a harsh voice from the Police or
the FBI. Instead, a girl’s voice, low and urgent, asked
for Mr Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Who’s calling?’ asked Bond, gaining time. He knew
the answer.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I know it’s you,’ said the voice, and Bond could feel
that it was right up against the mouthpiece. ‘This is
Solitaire.’ The name was scarcely breathed into the telephone.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond waited, all his senses pricked to what might be
the scene at the other end of the line. Was she alone?
Was she speaking foolishly on a house-phone with
extensions to which other listeners were now coldly,
intently glued? Or was she in a room with only Mr Big’s
eyes bent carefully on her, a pencil and pad beside him
so that he could prompt the next question?</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Listen,’ said the voice. ‘I’ve got to be quick. You
must trust me. I’m in a drugstore, but I must get back
at once to my room. Please believe me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had his handkerchief out. He spoke into it. ‘If
I can reach Mr Bond what shall I tell him?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, damn you,’ said the girl with what sounded like
a genuine touch of hysteria. ‘I swear by my mother, by
my unborn children. I’ve got to get away. And so have
you. You’ve got to take me. I’ll help you. I know a lot
of his secrets. But be quick. I’m risking my life here
talking to you.’ She gave a sob of exasperation and
panic. ‘For God’s sake trust me. You must. You
must!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond still paused, his mind working furiously.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Listen,’ she spoke again, but this time dully, almost
hopelessly. ‘If you don’t take me, I shall kill myself.
Now will you? Do you want to murder me?’</p>

<p class="pindent">If it was acting, it was too good acting. It was still
an unpardonable gamble, but Bond decided. He spoke
directly into the telephone, his voice low.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If this is a double-cross, Solitaire, I’ll get at you and
kill you if it’s the last thing I do. Have you got a pencil
and paper?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Wait,’ said the girl, excitedly. ‘Yes, yes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">If it had been a plant, reflected Bond, all that would
have been ready.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Be at Pennsylvania Station at ten-twenty exactly. The
Silver Phantom to . . .’ he hesitated, ‘. . . to Washington.
Car 245, Compartment H. Say you’re Mrs Bryce. Conductor
has the ticket in case I’m not there already. Go straight
to the compartment and wait for me. Got that?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ said the girl, ‘and thank you, thank you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t be seen,’ said Bond. ‘Wear a veil or something.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course,’ said the girl. ‘I promise. I really promise.
I must go.’ She rang off.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked at the dead receiver, then put it down
on the cradle. ‘Well,’ he said aloud. ‘That’s torn it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He got up and stretched. He walked to the window
and looked out, seeing nothing. His thoughts raced.
Then he shrugged and turned back to the telephone.
He looked at his watch. It was seven-thirty.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Room Service, good morning,’ said the golden
voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Breakfast, please,’ said Bond. ‘Pineapple juice, double.
Cornflakes and cream. Shirred eggs with bacon. Double
portion of Café Espresso. Toast and marmalade.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, Sir,’ said the girl. She repeated the order. ‘Right
away.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thank you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’re welcome.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond grinned to himself.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The condemned man made a hearty breakfast,’ he
reflected. He sat down by the window and gazed up at
the clear sky, into the future.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">Up in Harlem, at the big switchboard, The Whisper
was talking to the town again, passing Bond’s description
again to all Eyes: ‘All de railroads, all de airports.
Fifth Avenue an’ 55th Street doors of da San Regis. Mr
Big sez we gotta chance da highways. Pass it down da
line. All de railroads, all de airports . . .’</p>
