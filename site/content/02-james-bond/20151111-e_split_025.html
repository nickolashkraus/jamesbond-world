<p class="pindent">Like dangling emerald pendants the two humming-birds
were making their last rounds of the hibiscus and a
mocking bird had started on its evening song, sweeter
than a nightingale’s, from the summit of a bush of
night-scented jasmine.</p>

<p class="pindent">The jagged shadow of a man-of-war bird floated
across the green Bahama grass of the lawn as it sailed
on the air currents up the coast to some distant colony,
and a slate-blue kingfisher chattered angrily as it saw
the man sitting in the chair in the garden. It changed
its flight and swerved off across the sea to the island.
A brimstone butterfly flirted among the purple shadows
under the palms.</p>

<p class="pindent">The graded blue waters of the bay were quite still.
The cliffs of the island were a deep rose in the light of
the setting sun behind the house.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a smell of evening and of coolness after
a hot day and a slight scent of peat-smoke that came
from cassava being roasted in one of the fishermen’s
huts in the village away to the right.</p>

<p class="pindent">Solitaire came out of the house and walked on naked
feet across the lawn. She was carrying a tray with a
cocktail shaker and two glasses. She put it down on a
bamboo table beside Bond’s chair.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I hope I’ve made it right,’ she said. ‘Six to one sounds
terribly strong. I’ve never had Vodka Martinis before.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked up at her. She was wearing a pair of
his white silk pyjamas. They were far too large for her.
She looked absurdly childish.</p>

<p class="pindent">She laughed. ‘How do you like my Port Maria lipstick?’
she asked. ‘And the eyebrows made up with an
HB pencil. I couldn’t do anything with the rest of me
except wash it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You look wonderful,’ said Bond. ‘You’re far the prettiest
girl in the whole of Shark Bay. If I had some legs
and arms I’d get up and kiss you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Solitaire bent down and kissed him long on the lips,
one arm tightly round his neck. She stood up and
smoothed back the comma of black hair that had fallen
down over his forehead.</p>

<p class="pindent">They looked at each other for a moment, then she
turned to the table and poured him out a cocktail. She
poured half a glass for herself and sat down on the
warm grass and put her head against his knee. He played
with her hair with his right hand and they sat for a
while looking out between the trunks of the palm trees
at the sea and the light fading on the island.</p>

<p class="pindent">The day had been given over to licking wounds and
cleaning up the remains of the mess.</p>

<p class="pindent">When Quarrel had landed them on the little beach
at Beau Desert, Bond had half carried Solitaire across
the lawn and into the bathroom. He had filled the bath
full of warm water. Without her knowing what was
happening he had soaped and washed her whole body
and her hair. When he had cleaned away all the salt and
coral slime he helped her out, dried her and put merthiolate
on the coral cuts that striped her back and thighs.
Then he gave her a sleeping draught and put her naked
between the sheets in his own bed. He kissed her. Before
he had finished closing the jalousies she was asleep.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he got into the bath and Strangways soaped
him down and almost bathed his body in merthiolate.
He was raw and bleeding in a hundred places and his
left arm was numb from the barracuda bite. He had
lost a mouthful of muscle at the shoulder. The sting
of the merthiolate made him grind his teeth.</p>

<p class="pindent">He put on a dressing-gown and Quarrel drove him
to the hospital at Port Maria. Before he left he had a
Lucullian breakfast and a blessed first cigarette. He fell
asleep in the car and he slept on the operating table
and in the cot where they finally put him, a mass of
bandages and surgical tape.</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel brought him back in the early afternoon. By
that time Strangways had acted on the information Bond
had given him. There was a police detachment on the
Isle of Surprise; the wreck of the <span class="it">Secatur</span>, lying in about
twenty fathoms, was buoyed and the position being
patrolled by the Customs launch from Port Maria. The
salvage tug and divers were on their way from Kingston.
Reporters from the local press had been given a brief
statement and there was a police guard on the entrance
to Beau Desert prepared to repel the flood of newspapermen
who would arrive in Jamaica when the full
story got out to the world. Meanwhile a detailed report
had gone to M, and to Washington, so that The Big
Man’s team in Harlem and St Petersburg could be
rounded up and provisionally held on a blanket gold-smuggling
charge.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were no survivors from the <span class="it">Secatur</span>, but the
local fishermen had brought in nearly a ton of dead
fish that morning.</p>

<p class="pindent">Jamaica was aflame with rumours. There were serried
ranks of cars on the cliffs above the bay and along the
beach below. Word had got out about Bloody Morgan’s
treasure, but also about the packs of shark and barracuda
that had defended it, and because of them there
was not a swimmer who was planning to get out to the
scene of the wreck under cover of darkness.</p>

<p class="pindent">A doctor had been to visit Solitaire but had found
her chiefly concerned about getting some clothes and
the right shade of lip-stick. Strangways had arranged
for a selection to be sent over from Kingston next
day. For the time being she was experimenting with
the contents of Bond’s suitcase and a bowl of
hibiscus.</p>

<p class="pindent">Strangways got back from Kingston shortly after
Bond’s return from hospital. He had a signal for Bond
from M. It read:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="pindent1">PRESUME YOU HAVE FILED CLAIM TO TREASURE IN
YOUR NAME BEHALF UNIVERSAL EXPORT STOP
PROCEED IMMEDIATELY WITH SALVAGE STOP HAVE
ENGAGED COUNSEL TO PRESS OUR RIGHTS WITH
TREASURY AND COLONIAL OFFICE STOP MEANWHILE
VERY WELL DONE STOP FORTNIGHT’S PASSIONATE
LEAVE GRANTED ENDIT</p>

</div>

<p class="pindent">‘I suppose he means “Compassionate”,’ said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">Strangways looked solemn. ‘I expect so,’ he said. ‘I
made a full report of the damage to you. And to the
girl,’ he added.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hm,’ said Bond. ‘M’s cipherenes don’t often pick a
wrong group. However.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Strangways looked carefully out of the window with
his one eye.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s so like the old devil to think of the gold first,’
said Bond. ‘Suppose he thinks he can get away with it
and somehow dodge a reduction in the Secret Fund
when the next parliamentary estimates come round. I
expect half his life is taken up with arguing with the
Treasury. But still he’s been pretty quick off the mark.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I filed your claim at Government House directly I
got the signal,’ said Strangways. ‘But it’s going to be
tricky. The Crown will be after it and America will come
in somewhere as he was an American citizen. It’ll be a
long business.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They had talked some more and then Strangways had
left and Bond had walked painfully out into the garden
to sit for a while in the sunshine with his thoughts.</p>

<p class="pindent">In his mind he ran once more the gauntlet of dangers
he had entered on his long chase after The Big Man
and the fabulous treasure, and he lived again through
the searing flashes of time when he had looked various
deaths in the face.</p>

<p class="pindent">And now it was over and he sat in the sunshine among
the flowers with the prize at his feet and his hand in
her long black hair. He clasped the moment to him and
thought of the fourteen tomorrows that would be theirs
between them.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a crash of broken crockery from the
kitchen at the back of the house and the sound of
Quarrel’s voice thundering at someone.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Poor Quarrel,’ said Solitaire. ‘He’s borrowed the best
cook in the village and ransacked the markets for
surprises for us. He’s even found some black crabs, the
first of the season. Then he’s roasting a pitiful little
suckling pig and making an avocado pear salad and
we’re to finish up with guavas and coconut cream. And
Commander Strangways has left a case of the best
champagne in Jamaica. My mouth’s watering already.
But don’t forget it’s supposed to be a secret. I wandered
into the kitchen and found he had almost reduced the
cook to tears.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He’s coming with us on our passionate holiday,’ said
Bond. He told her of M’s cable. ‘We’re going to a house
on stilts with palm trees and five miles of golden sand.
And you’ll have to look after me very well because I
shan’t be able to make love with only one arm.’</p>

<p class="pindent">There was open sensuality in Solitaire’s eyes as she
looked up at him. She smiled innocently.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What about my back?’ she said.</p>
