<p class="pindent">Solitaire stood up.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I must go and tidy myself,’ she said. ‘I expect you’ve
both got plenty to talk about.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course,’ said Leiter, jumping up. ‘Crazy of me!
You must be dead beat. Guess you’d better take James’s
room and he can bed down with me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Solitaire followed him out into the little hall and Bond
heard Leiter explaining the arrangement of the
rooms.</p>

<p class="pindent">In a moment Leiter came back with a bottle of Haig
and Haig and some ice.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m forgetting my manners,’ he said. ‘We could both
do with a drink. There’s a small pantry next to the
bathroom and I’ve stocked it with all we’re likely to
need!’</p>

<p class="pindent">He fetched some soda-water and they both took a
long drink.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Let’s have the details,’ said Bond, sitting back. ‘Must
have been the hell of a fine job.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sure was,’ agreed Leiter, ‘except for the shortage of
corpses.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He put his feet on the table and lit a cigarette.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Phantom left Jacksonville around five,’ he began.
‘Got to Waldo around six. Just after leaving Waldo—and
here I’m guessing—Mr Big’s man comes along to your
car, gets into the next compartment to yours and hangs
a towel between the drawn blind and the window,
meaning—and he must have done a good deal of telephoning
at stations on the way down—meaning “the
window to the right of this towel is it”.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There’s a long stretch of straight track between
Waldo and Ocala,’ continued Leiter, ‘running through
forest and swamp land. State highway right alongside
the track. About twenty minutes outside Waldo, Wham!
goes a dynamite emergency signal under the leading
Diesel. Driver comes down to forty. Wham! And
another Wham! Three in line! Emergency! Halt at once!
He halts the train wondering what the hell. Straight
track. Last signal green over green. Nothing in sight.
It’s around quarter after six and just getting light. There’s
a sedan, clouted heap I expect [Bond raised an eyebrow.
“Stolen car,” explained Leiter], grey, thought to have been
a Buick, no lights, engine running, waiting on the
highway opposite the centre of the train. Three men
get out. Coloured. Probably negro. They walk slowly in
line abreast along the grass verge between the road and
the track. Two on the outside carry rippers—tommy-guns.
Man in the centre has something in his hand.
Twenty yards and they stop outside Car 245. Men with
the rippers give a double squirt at your window. Open
it up for the pineapple. Centre man tosses in the pineapple
and all three run back to the car. Two seconds
fuse. As they reach the car, BOOM! Fricassee of
Compartment H. Fricassee, presumably, of Mr and
Mrs Bryce. In fact fricassee of your Baldwin, who runs
out and crouches in the corridor directly he sees men
approaching his car. No other casualties except multiple
shock and hysterics throughout train. Car drives away
very fast towards limbo where it still is and will probably
remain. Silence, mingled with screams, falls. People
run to and fro. Train limps gingerly into Ocala. Drops
Car 245. Is allowed to proceed three hours later. Scene
II. Leiter sits alone in cottage, hoping he has never said
an unkind word to his friend James, and wondering how
Mr Hoover will have Mr Leiter served for his dinner
tonight. That’s all, folks.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. ‘What an organization!’ he said. ‘I’m
sure it’s all beautifully covered up and alibied. What a
man! He certainly seems to have the run of this country.
Just shows how one can push a democracy around,
what with <span class="it">habeas corpus</span> and human rights and all the
rest. Glad we haven’t got him on our hands in England.
Wooden truncheons wouldn’t make much of a dent in
him. Well,’ he concluded, ‘that’s three times I’ve managed
to get away with it. The pace is beginning to get a bit
hot.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ said Leiter thoughtfully. ‘Before you arrived over
here you could have counted the mistakes Mr Big has
ever made on one thumb. Now he’s made three all in
a row. He won’t like that. We’ve got to put the heat on
him while he’s still groggy and then get out, quick. Tell
you what I’ve got in mind. There’s no doubt that gold
gets into the States through this place. We’ve tracked
the <span class="it">Secatur</span> again and again and she just comes straight
over from Jamaica to St Petersburg and docks at that
worm-and-bait factory—Rubberus or whatever it’s
called.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ourobouros,’ said Bond. ‘The Great Worm of
mythology. Good name for a worm-and-bait factory.’
Suddenly a thought struck him. He hit the glass table-top
with the flat of his hand. ‘Felix! Of course.
Ourobouros—“The Robber”—don’t you see? Mr Big’s
man down here. It must be the same.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter’s face lit up. ‘Christ Almighty,’ he exclaimed.
‘Of course it’s the same. That Greek who’s supposed
to own it, the man in Tarpon Springs that figures in
the reports that blockhead showed us in New York,
Binswanger. He’s probably just a figurehead. Probably
doesn’t even know there’s anything phoney about it. It’s
his manager here we’ve got to get after. “The Robber.”
Of course that’s who it is.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter jumped up.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Cmon. Let’s get going. We’ll go right along and look
the place over. I was going to suggest it anyway, seeing
the <span class="it">Secatur</span> always docks at their wharf. She’s in Cuba
now, by the way,’ he added, ‘Havana. Cleared from here
a week ago. They searched her good and proper when
she came in and when she left. Didn’t find a thing, of
course. Thought she might have a false keel. Almost
tore it off. She had to go into dock before she could
sail again. Nix. Not a shadow of anything wrong. Let
alone a stack of gold coins. Anyway, we’ll go and smell
around. See if we can get a look at our Robber friend.
I’ll just have to talk to Orlando and Washington. Tell
’em all we know. They must catch up quick with The
Big Man’s fellow on the train. Probably too late by now.
You go and see how Solitaire’s getting on. Tell her she’s
not to move till we get back. Lock her in. We’ll take
her out to dinner in Tampa. They’ve got the best restaurant
on the whole coast, Cuban, “Los Novedades”. We’ll
stop at the airport on the way and fix her flight for
tomorrow.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter reached for the telephone and asked for Long
Distance. Bond left him to it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Ten minutes later they were on their way.</p>

<p class="pindent">Solitaire had not wanted to be left. She had clung to
Bond. ‘I want to get away from here,’ she said, her eyes
frightened. ‘I have a feeling . . .’ She didn’t end the
sentence. Bond kissed her.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s all right,’ he said. ‘We’ll be back in an hour or so.
Nothing can happen to you here. Then I shan’t leave
you until you’re on the plane. We can even stay the
night in Tampa and get you off at first light.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, please,’ said Solitaire anxiously. ‘I’d rather do
that. I’m frightened here. I feel in danger.’ She put her
arms round his neck. ‘Don’t think I’m being hysterical.’
She kissed him. ‘Now you can go. I just wanted to see
you. Come back quickly.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter had called and Bond had closed the door on
her and locked it.</p>

<p class="pindent">He followed Leiter to his car on the Parkway feeling
vaguely troubled. He couldn’t imagine that the girl could
come to any harm in this peaceful, law-abiding place,
or that The Big Man could conceivably have traced her
to The Everglades, which was only one of a hundred
similar beach establishments on Treasure Island. But
he respected the extraordinary power of her intuitions
and her attack of nerves made him uneasy.</p>

<p class="pindent">The sight of Leiter’s car put these thoughts out of
his mind.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond liked fast cars and he liked driving them. Most
American cars bored him. They lacked personality and
the patina of individual craftsmanship that European
cars have. They were just ‘vehicles’, similar in shape and
in colour, and even in the tone of their horns. Designed
to serve for a year and then be turned in in part exchange
for the next year’s model. All the fun of driving had
been taken out of them with the abolition of a gear-change,
with hydraulic-assisted steering and spongy
suspension. All effort had been smoothed away and all
of that close contact with the machine and the road
that extracts skill and nerve from the European driver.
To Bond, American cars were just beetle-shaped
Dodgems in which you motored along with one hand
on the wheel, the radio full on, and the power-operated
windows closed to keep out the draughts.</p>

<p class="pindent">But Leiter had got hold of an old Cord, one of the
few American cars with a personality, and it cheered
Bond to climb into the low-hung saloon, to hear the
solid bite of the gears and the masculine tone of the
wide exhaust. Fifteen years old, he reflected, yet still
one of the most modern-looking cars in the world.</p>

<p class="pindent">They swung on to the causeway and across the wide
expanse of unrippled water that separates the twenty
miles of narrow island from the broad peninsula
sprawling with St Petersburg and its suburbs.</p>

<p class="pindent">Already as they idled up Central Avenue on their way
across the town to the Yacht Basin and the main harbour
and the big hotels, Bond caught a whiff of the atmosphere
that makes the town the ‘Old Folks Home’ of
America. Everyone on the sidewalks had white hair,
white or blue, and the famous Sidewalk Davenports
that Solitaire had described were thick with oldsters
sitting in rows like the starlings in Trafalgar Square.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond noted the small grudging mouths of the
women, the sun gleaming on their pince-nez; the stringy,
collapsed chests and arms of the men displayed to the
sunshine in Truman shirts. The fluffy, sparse balls of
hair on the women showing the pink scalp. The bony
bald heads of the men. And, everywhere, a prattling
camaraderie, a swapping of news and gossip, a making
of folksy dates for the shuffle-board and the bridge-table,
a handing round of letters from children and
grandchildren, a tut-tutting about prices in the shops
and the motels.</p>

<p class="pindent">You didn’t have to be amongst them to hear it all. It
was all in the nodding and twittering of the balls of
blue fluff, the back-slapping and hawk-and-spitting of
the little old baldheads.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It makes you want to climb right into the tomb and
pull the lid down,’ said Leiter at Bond’s exclamations
of horror. ‘You wait till we get out and walk. If they
see your shadow coming up the sidewalk behind them
they jump out of the way as if you were the Chief
Cashier coming to look over their shoulders in the bank.
It’s ghastly. Makes me think of the bank clerk who went
home unexpectedly at midday and found the President
of the bank sleeping with his wife. He went back and
told his pals in the ledger department and said, “Gosh,
fellers, he nearly caught me!” ’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You can hear all the presentation gold watches ticking
in their pockets,’ said Leiter. ‘Place is full of undertakers,
and pawnshops stuffed with gold watches and masonic
rings and bits of jet and lockets full of hair. Makes you
shiver to think of it all. Wait till you go to Aunt Milly’s
Place and see them all in droves mumbling over their
corn-beef hash and cheeseburgers, trying to keep alive
till ninety. It’ll frighten the life out of you. But they’re
not all old down here. Take a look at that ad over there.’
He pointed towards a big hoarding on a deserted lot.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was an advertisement for maternity clothes.</p>

<p class="pindent"><span class="calibre4">STUTZHEIMER &amp; BLOCK</span>, it said, <span class="calibre4">IT’S NEW! OUR
ANTICIPATION DEPARTMENT, AND AFTER! CLOTHES
FOR CHIPS (1-4) AND TWIGS (4-8).</span></p>

<p class="pindent">Bond groaned. ‘Let’s get away from here,’ he said.
‘This is really beyond the call of duty.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They came down to the waterfront and turned right
until they came to the seaplane base and the Coastguard
Station. The streets were free of oldsters and here there
was the normal life of a harbour—wharves, warehouses,
a ship’s chandler, some up-turned boats, nets drying,
the cry of seagulls, the rather fetid smell coming in off
the bay. After the teeming boneyard of the town the
sign over the garage: ‘Drive-ur-Self. Pat Grady. The
Smiling Irishman. Used cars,’ was a cheerful reminder
of a livelier, bustling world.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Better get out and walk,’ said Leiter. ‘The Robber’s
place is in the next block.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They left the car beside the harbour and sauntered
along past a timber warehouse and some oil-storage
tanks. Then they turned left again towards the sea.</p>

<p class="pindent">The side-road ended at a small weather-beaten
wooden jetty that reached out twenty feet on barnacled
piles into the bay. Right up against its open gate was a
long low corrugated-iron warehouse. Over its wide
double doors was painted, black on white, <span class="calibre4">OUROBOUROS
INC. LIVE WORM AND BAIT MERCHANTS. CORAL,
SHELLS, TROPICAL FISH. WHOLESALE ONLY</span>. In one
of the double doors there was a smaller door with a
gleaming Yale lock. On the door was a sign: <span class="calibre4">PRIVATE,
KEEP OUT</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">Against this a man sat on a kitchen chair, its back
tilted so that the door supported his weight. He was
cleaning a rifle, a Remington 30 it looked like to Bond.
He had a wooden toothpick sticking out of his mouth
and a battered baseball cap on the back of his head.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was wearing a stained white singlet that revealed
tufts of black hair under his arms, and slept-in white
canvas trousers and rubber-soled sneakers. He was
around forty and his face was as knotted and seamed
as the mooring posts on the jetty. It was a thin, hatchet
face, and the lips were thin too, and bloodless. His
complexion was the colour of tobacco dust, a sort of
yellowy-beige. He looked cruel and cold, like the bad
man in a film about poker-players and gold mines.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond and Leiter walked past him and on to the pier.
He didn’t look up from his rifle as they went past but
Bond sensed that his eyes were following them.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If that isn’t The Robber,’ said Leiter, ‘it’s a blood
relation.’</p>

<p class="pindent">A pelican, grey with a pale yellow head, was hunched
on one of the mooring posts at the end of the jetty.
He let them get very close, then reluctantly gave a few
heavy beats of his wings and planed down towards the
water. The two men stood and watched him flying slowly
along just above the surface of the harbour. Suddenly
he crashed clumsily down, his long bill snaking out and
down in front of him. It came up clutching a small fish
which he moodily swallowed. Then the heavy bird got
up again and went on fishing, flying mostly into the
sun so that its big shadow would give no warning. When
Bond and Leiter turned to walk back down the jetty it
gave up fishing and glided back to its post. It settled
with a clatter of wings and resumed its thoughtful
consideration of the late afternoon.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man was still bent over his gun, wiping the
mechanism with an oily rag.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good afternoon,’ said Leiter. ‘You the manager of
this wharf?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yep,’ said the man without looking up.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Wondered if there was any chance of mooring my
boat here. Basin’s pretty crowded.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nope.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter took out his notecase. ‘Would twenty talk?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nope.’ The man gave a rattling hawk in his throat
and spat directly between Bond and Leiter.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hey,’ said Leiter. ‘You want to watch your manners.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The man deliberated. He looked up at Leiter. He had
small, close-set eyes as cruel as a painless dentist’s.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What’s a name of your boat?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The <span class="it">Sybil</span>,’ said Leiter.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ain’t no sich boat in the Basin,’ said the man. He
clicked the breech shut on his rifle. It lay casually on
his lap pointing down the approach to the warehouse,
away from the sea.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’re blind,’ said Leiter. ‘Been there a week. Sixty-foot
twin-screw Diesel. White with a green awning.
Rigged for fishing.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The rifle started to move lazily in a low arc. The man’s
left hand was at the trigger, his right just in front of
the trigger-guard, pivoting the gun.</p>

<p class="pindent">They stood still.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man sat lazily looking down at the breech, his
chair still tilted against the small door with the yellow
Yale lock.</p>

<p class="pindent">The gun slowly traversed Leiter’s stomach, then
Bond’s. The two men stood like statues, not risking a
move of the hand. The gun stopped pivoting. It was
pointing down the wharf. The Robber looked briefly
up, narrowed his eyes and pulled the trigger. The pelican
gave a faint squawk and they heard its heavy body crash
into the water. The echo of the shot boomed across
the harbour.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What the hell d’you do that for?’ asked Bond furiously.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Practice,’ said the man, pumping another bullet into
the breech.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Guess there’s a branch of the ASPCA in this town,’
said Leiter. ‘Let’s get along there and report this guy.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Want to be prosecuted for trespass?’ asked The
Robber, getting slowly up and shifting the gun under
his arm. ‘This is private property. Now,’ he spat the
words out, ‘git the hell out of here.’ He turned and
yanked the chair away from the door, opened the door
with a key and turned with one foot on the threshold.
‘You both got guns,’ he said. ‘I kin smell ’em. You come
aroun’ here again and you follow the boid ’n I plead
self-defence. I’ve had a bellyful of you lousy dicks aroun’
here lately breathin’ down my neck. <span class="it">Sybil</span> my ass!’ He
turned contemptuously through the door and slammed
it so that the frame rattled.</p>

<p class="pindent">They looked at each other. Leiter grinned ruefully
and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Round One to The Robber,’ he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">They moved off down the dusty side-road. The sun
was setting and the sea behind them was a pool of
blood. When they got to the main road, Bond looked
back. A big arc light had come on over the door and
the approach to the warehouse was stripped of
shadows.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No good trying anything from the front,’ said Bond.
‘But there’s never been a warehouse with only one
entrance.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Just what I was thinking,’ said Leiter. ‘We’ll save that
for the next visit.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They got into the car and drove slowly home across
Central Avenue.</p>

<p class="pindent">On their way home Leiter asked a string of questions
about Solitaire. Finally he said casually, ‘By the way,
hope I fixed the rooms like you want them.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Couldn’t be better,’ said Bond cheerfully.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Fine,’ said Leiter. ‘Just occurred to me you two might
be hyphenating.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You read too much Winchell,’ said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s just a delicate way of putting it,’ said Leiter. ‘Don’t
forget the walls of those cottages are pretty thin. I use
my ears for hearing with—not for collecting lipstick.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond grabbed for a handkerchief. ‘You lousy, goddam
sleuth,’ he said furiously.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter watched him scrubbing at himself out of the
corner of his eye. ‘What are you doing?’ he asked innocently.
‘I wasn’t for a moment suggesting the colour of
your ears was anything but a natural red. However . . .’
He put a wealth of meaning into the word.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If you find yourself dead in your bed tonight,’
laughed Bond, ‘you’ll know who did it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They were still chaffing each other when they arrived
at The Everglades and they were laughing when the
grim Mrs Stuyvesant greeted them on the lawn.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Pardon me, Mr Leiter,’ she said. ‘But I’m afraid we
can’t allow music here. I can’t have the other guests
disturbed at all hours.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They looked at her in astonishment. ‘I’m sorry, Mrs
Stuyvesant,’ said Leiter. ‘I don’t quite get you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That big radiogram you had sent round,’ said Mrs
Stuyvesant. ‘The men could hardly get the packing-case
through the door.’</p>
