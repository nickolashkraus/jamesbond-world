<h2 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_38"><span class="calibre1">The Lovesome Spot</span></h2>

<p class="line8"><span class="sc">Kissy’s crawl was</span> steady and relaxed, and Bond had no
difficulty in following the twinkling feet and the twin
white mounds of her behind, divided excitingly by the
black cord. But he was glad he had donned flippers because
the tug of his floating container against the wrist
was an irritating brake and, for the first half of the swim,
they were heading diagonally against the easterly current
through the straits. But then Kissy slightly changed her
direction, and now they could paddle lazily in towards the
soaring wall that soon became their whole horizon.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were a few tumbled rocks at its base, but Kissy
stayed in the water, clinging to a clump of seaweed, in
case the moon might betray her gleaming body to a sentry
or a chance patrol, though Bond guessed that the guards
kept clear of the grounds during the night so that the suicides
would have free entry. Bond pulled himself up on
the rocks and unzipped the container and extracted the
packet of iron pitons. Then he climbed up a few feet so
that he could stow his flippers away in a crack between
the granite blocks above high-water mark, and he was
ready to go. He blew a kiss to the girl. She replied with
the sideways wave of the hand that is the Japanese sign
of farewell and then was off across the sea again, a luminous
white torpedo that merged quickly into the path of
the moon.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond put her out of his thoughts. He was getting chilled
in his soaking black camouflage, and it was time to get
moving. He examined the fitting of the giant stone blocks
and found that the cracks between them were spacious, as
in the case of Tiger’s training castle, and would probably
provide adequate toe-holds. Then he pulled down his black
cowl and, towing the black container behind him, began
his climb.</p>

<p class="pindent">It took him twenty minutes to cover the two hundred
feet of the slightly inclined wall, but he only had to use
his pitons twice when he came to cracks that were too
narrow to give a hold to his aching toes. And then he was
at one of the gun-ports. He slithered quietly across its six
feet of flat masonry and cautiously looked over the edge
into the park. As he had expected, there were stone steps
down from the gun-port, and he crept down these into
the dark shadows at its base and stood up against the inside
of the wall, panting quietly. He waited for his breath
to calm down and then slipped back his cowl and listened.
Not a wisp of wind stirred in the trees, but from somewhere
came the sound of softly running water and, in the
background, a regular glutinous burping and bubbling.
The fumaroles! Bond, a black shadow among the rest,
edged along the wall to his right. His first task was to
find a hide-out, a base camp where he could bivouac in
emergency and where he could leave his container. He reconnoitred
various groves and clumps of bushes, but they
were all damnably well-kept, and the undergrowth had
been meticulously cleared from their roots. And many of
them exuded a sickly sweet, poisonous night-smell. Then,
up against the wall, he came upon a lean-to shed, its rickety
door ajar. He listened and then inched the door open. As
he had expected, there was a shadowy jumble of gardeners’
tools, wheelbarrows, and the like, and the musty smell of
such places. Moving carefully, and helped by shafts of
moonlight through the wide cracks in the planked walls,
he got to the back of the hut, where there was an untidy
mound of used sacking. He reflected for a moment and
decided that, though this place would be often visited, it
had great promise. He untied the cord of the container
from his wrist and proceeded methodically to move some
of the sacks forward so as to provide a nest for himself
behind them. When it was finished, and final touches of
artistic disarray added, he parked his container behind the
barrier and crept out again into the park to continue what
he planned should be a first quick survey of the whole
property.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond kept close to the boundary wall, flitting like a bat
across the open spaces between clumps of bushes and trees.
Although his hands were covered with the black material
of the <span class="it">ninja</span> suit, he avoided contact with the vegetation,
which emitted a continually changing variety of strong
odours and scents amongst which he recognized, as a result
of ancient adventures in the Caribbean, only the sugary
perfume of dogwood. He came to the lake, a wide
silent shimmer of silver from which rose the thin cloud
of steam he remembered from the aerial photograph. As
he stood and watched it, a large leaf from one of the surrounding
trees came wafting down and settled on the surface
near him. At once a quick purposeful ripple swept
down on the leaf from the surrounding water and immediately
subsided. There were some kind of fish in the lake,
and they would be carnivores. Only carnivores would be
excited like that at the hint of a prey. Beyond the lake,
Bond came on the first of the fumaroles, a sulphurous, bubbling
pool of mud that constantly shuddered and spouted
up little fountains. From yards away, Bond could feel its
heat. Jets of stinking steam puffed out and disappeared,
wraith-like, towards the sky. Now the jagged silhouette of
the castle, with its winged turrets, showed above the tree-line,
and Bond crept forward with added caution, alert
for the moment when he would come upon the treacherous
gravel that surrounded it. Suddenly, through a belt of
trees, he was facing it. He stopped in the shelter of the
trees, his heart hammering under his rib-cage.</p>

<p class="pindent">Close to, the soaring black-and-gold pile reared monstrously
over him, and the diminishing curved roofs of
the storeys were like vast bat-wings against the stars. It
was even bigger than Bond had imagined, and the supporting
wall of black granite blocks more formidable. He
reflected on the seemingly impossible problem of entry.
Behind would be the main entrance, the lowish wall, and
the open country-side. But didn’t castles always have an
alternative entrance low down for a rearward escape? Bond
stole cautiously forward, laying his feet flat down so that
the gravel barely stirred. The many eyes of the castle,
glittering white in the moonlight, watched his approach
with the indifference of total power. At any moment, he
expected the white shaft of a searchlight or the yellow-and-blue
flutter of gunfire. But he reached the base of the
wall without incident and followed it along to the left,
remembering from ancient schooling that most castles had
an exit at moat level beneath the drawbridge.</p>

<p class="pindent">And so it was with the castle of Doctor Shatterhand—a
small nail-studded door, arched and weather-beaten. Its
hinges and lock were cracked and rusty, but a new padlock
and chain had been stapled into the woodwork and
the stone frame. No moonlight filtered down to this corner
of what must once have been a moat but was now
grassed over. Bond felt carefully with his fingers. Yes! The
chain and lock would yield to the file and jemmy in his
conjurer’s pockets. Would there be bolts on the inner side?
Probably not, or the padlock would not have been thought
necessary. Bond softly retraced his steps across the gravel,
stepping meticulously in his previous foot-marks. That
door would be his target for tomorrow!</p>

<p class="pindent">Now, keeping right-handed, but still following the
boundary wall, he crept off again on his survey. Once,
something slithered away from his approaching feet and
disappeared with a heavy rustle into the fallen leaves under
a tree. What snakes were there that really went for
a man? The king-cobra, black mamba, the saw-scaled viper,
the rattlesnake, and the fer de lance. What others?
The remainder were inclined to make off if disturbed.
Were snakes day or night hunters? Bond didn’t know.
Among so many hazards, there weren’t even the odds of
Russian Roulette. When all the chambers of the pistol were
loaded, there was not even a one-in-six chance to bank
on.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was now on the castle side of the lake. He heard
a noise and edged behind a tree. The distant crashing in
the shrubbery sounded like a wounded animal, but then,
down the path, came staggering a man, or what had once
been a man. The brilliant moonlight showed a head swollen
to the size of a football, and only small slits remained
where the eyes and mouth had been. The man moaned
softly as he zigzagged along, and Bond could see that his
hands were up to his puffed face and that he was trying
to prise apart the swollen skin round his eyes so that he
could see out. Every now and then he stopped and let out
one word in an agonizing howl to the moon. It was not
a howl of fear or of pain, but of dreadful supplication.
Suddenly he stopped. He seemed to see the lake for the
first time. With a terrible cry, and holding out his arms
as if to meet a loved one, he made a quick run to the edge
and threw himself in. At once there came the swirl of
movement Bond had noticed before, but this time it involved
a great area of water and there was a wild boiling
of the surface round the vaguely threshing body. A mass
of small fish were struggling to get at the man, particularly
at the naked hands and face, and their six-inch bodies
glittered and flashed in the moonlight. Once the man raised
his head and let out a single terrible scream, and Bond
saw that his face was encrusted with pendent fish as if
with silvery locks of hair. Then his head fell back into
the lake and he rolled over and over as if trying to rid
himself of his attackers. But slowly the black stain spread
and spread around him and finally, perhaps because his
jugular had been pierced, he lay still, face downwards in
the water, and his head jigged slightly with the ceaseless
momentum of the attack.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond wiped the cold sweat off his face. Piranha!
The South American fresh-water killer whose massive jaws
and flat razor-sharp teeth can strip a horse down to the
bones in under an hour! And this man had been one of
the suicides who had heard of this terrible death! He had
come searching for the lake and had got his face poisoned
by some pretty shrub. The Herr Doktor had certainly provided
a feast for his victims. Unending dishes for their
delectation! A true banquet of death!</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond shuddered and went on his way. All right,
Blofeld, he thought, that’s one more notch on the sword
that is already on its way down to your neck. Brave words!
Bond hugged the wall and kept going. Gun-metal was
showing in the east.</p>

<p class="pindent">But the Garden of Death hadn’t quite finished the display
of its wares.</p>

<p class="pindent">All over the park, a slight smell of sulphur hung in the
air, and many times Bond had had to detour round steaming
cracks in the ground and the quaking mud of fumaroles,
identified by a warning circle of white-painted
stones. The Doctor was most careful lest anyone should
fall into one of these liquid furnaces by mistake! But now
Bond came to one the size of a circular tennis court, and
here there was a rough shrine in the grotto at the back
of it and, dainty touch, a vase with flowers in it—chrysanthemums,
because it was now almost the chrysanthemum
season. They were arranged with some sprigs of dwarf
maple, in a pattern which no doubt spelled out some fragrant
message to the initiates of Japanese flower arrangement.
And opposite the grotto, behind which Bond in his
ghostly black uniform crouched in concealment, a Japanese
gentleman stood in rapt contemplation of the bursting
mud-boils that were erupting genteelly in the simmering
soup of the pool. James Bond thought “gentleman”
because the man was dressed in the top hat, frock coat,
striped trousers, stiff collar and spats of a high government
official—or of the father of the bride. And the gentleman
held a carefully rolled umbrella between his clasped hands,
and his head was bowed over its crook as if in penance.
He was speaking, in a soft compulsive babble, like someone
in a highly ritualistic church, but he made no gestures
and just stood, humbly, quietly, either confessing or asking
one of the gods for something.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stood against a tree, black in the blackness. He
felt he should intervene in what he knew to be the man’s
purpose. But how to do so, knowing no Japanese, having
nothing but his “deaf and dumb” card to show? And it
was vital that he should remain a “ghost” in the garden,
not get involved in some daft argument with a man he
didn’t know, about some ancient sin he could never understand.
So Bond stood, while the trees threw long black
arms across the scene, and waited, with a cold, closed, stone
face, for death to walk on stage.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man stopped talking. He raised his head and gazed
up at the moon. He politely lifted his shining top hat.
Then he replaced it, tucked his umbrella under one arm,
and sharply clapped his hands. Then walking, as if to a
business appointment, calmly, purposefully, he took the
few steps to the edge of the bubbling fumarole, stepped
carefully over the warning stones, and went on walking.
He sank slowly in the glutinous grey slime; not a sound
escaped his lips until, as the tremendous heat reached his
groin, he uttered one rasping “Arghh!” and the gold in
his teeth showed as his head arched back in the rictus of
death. Then he was gone, and only the top hat remained,
tossing on a small fountain of mud that spat intermittently
into the air. Then the hat slowly crumpled with
the heat and disappeared, and a great belch was uttered
from the belly of the fumarole and a horrible stench of
cooking meat overcame the pervading stink of sulphur and
reached Bond’s nostrils.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond controlled his rising gorge. Honourable salary-man
had gone to honourable ancestors—his unknown sin expiated
as his calcined bones sank slowly down into the stomach
of the world. And one more statistic would be run
up on Blofeld’s abacus of death. Why didn’t the Japanese
air-force come and bomb this place to eternity, set the
castle and the poison garden ablaze with napalm? How
could this man continue to have protection from a bunch
of botanists and scientists? And now here was he, Bond,
alone in this hell to try and do the job with almost no
weapon but his bare hands. It was hopeless! He was scarcely
being given a chance in a million. Tiger and his Prime
Minister were certainly exacting their pound of flesh in
exchange for their precious <span class="sc">magic</span> 44—one hundred and
eighty-two pounds of it, to be exact!</p>

<p class="pindent">Cursing his fate, cursing Tiger, cursing the whole of Japan,
Bond went on his way, while a small voice whispered
in his ear, “But don’t you want to kill Blofeld? Don’t you
want to avenge Tracy? Isn’t this a God-given chance? You
have done well tonight. You have penetrated his defences
and spied out the land. You have even found a way into
his castle and probably up to his bedroom. Kill him in his
sleep tomorrow! And kill her, too, while you’re about it!
And then back into Kissy’s arms and, in a week or two,
back over the pole to London and to the applause of your
chief. Come on! Somewhere in Japan, a Japanese is committing
suicide every thirty minutes all through the year.
Don’t be squeamish because you’ve just seen a couple of
numbers ticked off on a sheet in the Ministry of Health,
a couple of points added to a graph. Snap out of it! Get
on with the job!”</p>

<p class="pindent">And Bond listened to the whisper and went on round
the last mile of wall and back to the gardeners’ hut.</p>

<p class="pindent">He took a last look round before going in. He could
see a neck of the lake about twenty yards away. It was
now gun-metal in the approaching dawn. Some big insects
were flitting and darting through the softly rising steam.
They were pink dragonflies. Pink ones. Dancing and skimming.
But of course! The <span class="it">haiku</span> of Tiger’s dying agent!
That was the last nightmarish touch to this obscenity of
a place. Bond went into the hut, picked his way carefully
between the machines and wheelbarrows, pulled some sacks
over himself, and fell into a shallow sleep full of ghosts
and demons and screams.</p>
