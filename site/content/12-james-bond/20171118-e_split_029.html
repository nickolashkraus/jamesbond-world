<p class="pindent">As your readers will have learned from earlier issues,
a senior officer of the Ministry of Defence, Commander
James Bond, <span class="sc">c.m.g.</span>, <span class="sc">r.n.v.r.</span>, is missing, believed killed,
while on an official mission to Japan. It grieves me to
have to report that hopes of his survival must now be
abandoned. It therefore falls to my lot, as the head of
the department he served so well, to give some account
of this officer and of his outstanding services to his country.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond was born of a Scottish father, Andrew
Bond of Glencoe, and a Swiss mother, Monique Delacroix,
from the Canton de Vaud. His father being a
foreign representative of the Vickers armaments firm,
his early education, from which he inherited a first-class
command of French and German, was entirely abroad.
When he was eleven years of age, both his parents were
killed in a climbing accident in the Aiguilles Rouges
above Chamonix, and the youth came under the guardianship
of an aunt, since deceased, Miss Charmian Bond,
and went to live with her at the quaintly named hamlet
of Pett Bottom near Canterbury in Kent. There, in
a small cottage hard by the attractive Duck Inn, his
aunt, who must have been a most erudite and accomplished
lady, completed his education for an English
public school, and at the age of twelve or thereabouts,
he passed satisfactorily into Eton, for which College he
had been entered at birth by his father. It must be admitted
that his career at Eton was brief and undistinguished,
and after only two halves, as a result, it pains
me to record, of some alleged trouble with one of the
boys’ maids, his aunt was requested to remove him. She
managed to obtain his transfer to Fettes, his father’s old
school. Here the atmosphere was somewhat Calvinistic,
and both academic and athletic standards were rigorous.
Nevertheless, though inclined to be solitary by nature,
he established some firm friendships among the
traditionally famous athletic circles at the school. By
the time he left, at the early age of seventeen, he had
twice fought for the school as a light-weight and had,
in addition, founded the first serious judo class at an
English public school. By now it was 1941, and by
claiming an age of nineteen and with the help of an
old Vickers colleague of his father, he entered a branch
of what was subsequently to become the Ministry of
Defence. To serve the confidential nature of his duties,
he was accorded the rank of lieutenant in the Special
Branch of the R.N.V.R., and it is a measure of the satisfaction
his services gave to his superiors that he ended
the war with the rank of commander. It was about this
time that the writer became associated with certain aspects
of the ministry’s work, and it was with much
gratification that I accepted Commander Bond’s post-war
application to continue working for the ministry
in which, at the time of his lamented disappearance, he
had risen to the rank of Principal Officer in the Civil
Service.</p>

<p class="pindent">The nature of Commander Bond’s duties with the
ministry, which were, incidentally, recognized by the
appointment of C.M.G. in 1954, must remain confidential,
nay secret, but his colleagues at the ministry will
allow that he performed them with outstanding bravery
and distinction, although occasionally, through an impetuous
strain in his nature, with a streak of the foolhardy
that brought him in conflict with higher authority.
But he possessed what almost amounted to “The
Nelson Touch” in moments of the highest emergency,
and he somehow contrived to escape more or less unscathed
from the many adventurous paths down which
his duties led him. The inevitable publicity, particularly
in the foreign press, accorded some of these adventures,
made him, much against his will, something of a public
figure, with the inevitable result that a series of popular
books came to be written around him by a personal
friend and former colleague of James Bond. If the
quality of these books, or their degree of veracity, had
been any higher, the author would certainly have been
prosecuted under the Official Secrets Act. It is a measure
of the disdain in which these fictions are held at
the ministry that action has not yet—I emphasize the
qualification—been taken against the author and publisher
of these high-flown and romanticized caricatures
of episodes in the career of an outstanding public servant.</p>

<p class="pindent">It only remains to conclude this brief <span class="it">in memoriam</span>
by assuring his friends that Commander Bond’s last mission
was one of supreme importance to the state. Although
it now appears that, alas, he will not return from
it, I have the authority of the highest quarters in the
land to confirm that the mission proved one hundred
per cent successful. It is no exaggeration to pronounce
unequivocally that, through the recent valorous efforts
of this one man, the Safety of the Realm has received
mighty reassurance.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond was briefly married in 1962, to Teresa,
only daughter of Marc-Ange Draco, of Marseilles. The
marriage ended in tragic circumstances that were reported
in the press at the time. There was no issue of
the marriage, and James Bond leaves, so far as I am
aware, no relative living.</p>

<p class="line8">M.G. writes:</p>

<p class="pindent">I was happy and proud to serve Commander Bond in
a close capacity during the past three years at the Ministry
of Defence. If indeed our fears for him are justified,
may I suggest these simple words for his epitaph?
Many of the junior staff here feel they represent his
philosophy: “I shall not waste my days in trying to prolong
them. I shall use my time.”</p>
