<h2 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_31"><span class="calibre1">Instant Japan</span></h2>

<p class="line8"><span class="sc">The black Toyopet</span> hurtled through the deserted streets,
which were shiny with the dew of what would be a beautiful
day.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger had dressed in casual clothes as if for a country
outing. He had a small overnight bag on the seat beside
him. They were on the way to a bath-house which Tiger
said was of a very special, a very pleasurable nature. It
was also, Tiger said, very discreet, and the opportunity
would be taken to make a start in transforming Bond’s
appearance into something more closely resembling a Japanese.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger had overridden all Bond’s objections. On all the
evidence, this doctor was a purveyor of death. Because he
was mad? Because it amused him? Tiger neither knew nor
cared. For obvious reasons of policy, his assassination,
which had been officially agreed to, could not be carried
out by a Japanese. Bond’s appearance on the scene was
therefore very timely. He had had much practice in such
clandestine operations, and if he was subsequently arrested
by the Japanese police, an adequate cover story involving
foreign intelligence services could be cooked up. He would
be tried, sentenced, and then quietly smuggled out of the
country. If he failed, then presumably the doctor or his
guards would kill him. That would be too bad. Bond
argued that he had personally nothing against this Swiss
botanist. Tiger replied that any good man’s hand would
be against a man who had already killed five hundred of
his fellow creatures. Was that not so? And in any case,
Bond was being hired to do this act in exchange for <span class="sc">magic</span>
44. Did that not quieten his conscience? Bond agreed reluctantly
that it did. As a last resort, Bond said that the
operation was in any case impossible. A foreigner in Japan
could be spotted five miles away. Tiger replied that
this matter had been provided for and the first step was
a visit to this most discreet bath-house. Here Bond would
receive his first treatment and then get some sleep before
catching the train on which Tiger would be accompanying
him. And Tiger, with a devilish grin, had assured him
that at any rate part of his treatment would be most pleasurable
and relaxing.</p>

<p class="pindent">The exterior of the bath-house looked like a Japanese
inn—some carefully placed stepping-stones meandering
briefly between dwarf pines, a wide-open, yellow-lighted
doorway with a vista of polished wood floors behind, three
bowing, smiling women in traditional dress, as bright as
birds although it was nearly five in the morning, and the
inevitable row of spotless but undersized slippers. After
much bowing and counter-bowing and a few phrases from
Tiger, Bond took off his shoes and, in his socks (explanation
by Tiger; polite giggles behind raised hands), did as
Tiger told him and followed one of the women along a
gleaming corridor and through an open partition that revealed
a miniature combination of a bedroom and a Turkish
bath. A young girl, wearing nothing but tight, brief
white shorts and an exiguous white brassière, bowed low,
said, “Excuse, please,” and began to unbutton Bond’s trousers.
Bond held the pretty hand where it was. He turned
to the older woman who was about to close the partition
and said, “Tanaka-san,” in a voice that pleaded and ordered.
Tiger was fetched. He was wearing nothing but
his underpants. He said, “What is it now?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “Now listen, Tiger, I’m sure this pretty girl
and I will get along very well indeed. But just tell me
what the menu is. Am I going to eat her or is she going
to eat me?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger said patiently, “You really must learn to obey orders
without asking questions, Bondo-san. That is the essence
of our relationship during the next few days. You
see that box? When she has undressed you, she will put
you in the box which has a charcoal fire under it. You
will sweat. After perhaps ten minutes, she will help you
out of the box and wash you from head to foot. She will
even tenderly clean out your ears with a special ivory instrument.
She will then pour a very tenacious dark dye
with which she has been supplied into that tiled bath in
the floor, and you will get in. You will relax and bathe
your face and hair. She will then dry you and cut your
hair in the Japanese style. She will then give you a massage
on that couch and, according to your indications, she
will make this massage as delightful, as prolonged as you
wish. You will then go to sleep. When you are awakened
with eggs and bacon and coffee, you will kiss the girl good
morning and shave, or the other way round, and that
will be that.” Tiger curtly asked the girl a question. She
brushed back her bang of black hair coquettishly and replied.
“The girl says she is eighteen and that her name is
Mariko Ichiban. Mariko means ‘Truth’ and Ichiban means
‘number one.’ The girls in these establishments are numbered.
And now, please don’t disturb me any more. I am
about to enjoy myself in a similar fashion, but without
the walnut stain. And please, in future, have faith. You
are about to undergo a period of entirely new sensations.
They may be strange and surprising. They will not be
painful—while you are under my authority, that is. Savour
them. Enjoy them as if each one was your last. All
right? Then good night, my dear Bondo-san. The night
will be short, alas, but if you embrace it fully, it will be
totally delightful up to the last squirm of ecstasy. And,”
Tiger gave a malicious wave of the hand as he went out
and closed the partition, “you will arise from it what is
known as ‘a new man.’ ”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond got at any rate part of the message. As
Mariko’s busy fingers proceeded to remove his trousers and
then his shirt, he lifted her chin and kissed her full on the
soft, yielding, bud-like mouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">Later, sitting sweating and reflecting in the comfortable
wooden box, very tired, slightly but cheerfully drunk, he
remembered his dismal thoughts in Queen Mary’s Rose
Garden. He also remembered his interview with M., and
M. saying that he could leave the hardware behind on this
purely diplomatic assignment; the lines of irony round
Bond’s mouth deepened.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mariko was looking into the wall mirror and fiddling
with her hair and eyebrows. Bond said, “Mariko. Out!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Mariko smiled and bowed. She unhurriedly removed her
brassière and came towards the wooden box.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond reflected, What was it that Tiger had said about
becoming a new man? He reached for Mariko’s helping
hands and watched her breasts tauten as she pulled him
out and towards her.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">It was indeed a new man who followed Tiger through
the thronged halls of Tokyo main station. Bond’s face and
hands were of a light brown tint, his black hair, brightly
oiled, was cut and neatly combed in a short fringe that
reached halfway down his forehead, and the outer corners
of his eyebrows had been carefully shaved so that they
now slanted upwards. He was dressed, like so many of the
other travellers, in a white cotton shirt buttoned at the
wrists and a cheap, knitted silk, black tie exactly centred
with a rolled gold pin. His ready-made black trousers, held
up by a cheap black plastic belt, were rather loose in the
fork, because Japanese behinds are inclined to hang low,
but the black plastic sandals and dark blue nylon socks
were exactly the right size. A much-used overnight bag
of Japan Air Lines was slung over his shoulder, and this
contained a change of shirt, singlet, pants, and socks, Shinsei
cigarettes, and some cheap Japanese toilet articles. In
his pockets were a comb, a cheap, used wallet containing
some five thousand yen in small denomination notes, and
a stout pocket knife which, by Japanese law, had a blade
not more than two inches long. There was no handkerchief,
only a packet of tissues. (Later, Tiger explained.
“Bondo-san, this Western habit of blowing the nose and
carefully wrapping up the result in silk or fine linen and
harbouring it in your pocket as if it were something precious!
Would you do the same thing with the other excretions
of your body? Exactly! So, if in Japan you wish
to blow your nose, perform the act decorously and dispose
at once, tidily, of the result.”)</p>

<p class="pindent">Despite his height, Bond merged quite adequately into
the bustling, shoving crowds of passengers. His “disguise”
had mysteriously appeared in his room at the bath-house,
and Mariko had greatly enjoyed dressing him up. “Now
Japanese gentreman,” she had said approvingly as, with a
last lingering kiss, she had gone to answer Tiger’s rap on
the partition. Bond’s own clothes and possessions had already
been taken away.</p>

<p class="pindent">“They and your things from the hotel will be transferred
to Dikko’s apartment,” Tiger had said. “Later today,
Dikko will inform your chief that you have left
Tokyo with me for a visit to the MAGIC establishment,
which is, in fact, a day’s journey from Tokyo, and that
you will be away for several days. Dikko believes that this
is so. My own department merely know that I shall be
absent on a mission to Fukuoka. They do not know that
you are accompanying me. And now we will take the express
to Gamagori on the south coast and the evening
hydrofoil across Atsumi and Ise Bays to the fishing port
of Toba. There we will spend the night. This is to be a
slow journey to Fukuoka for the purpose of training and
educating you. It is necessary that I make you familiar
with Japanese customs and folkways so that you make as
few mistakes as possible—when the time comes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The gleaming orange and silver express slid to a stop
beside them. Tiger barged his way on board. Bond waited
politely for two or three women to precede him. When
he sat down beside Tiger, Tiger hissed angrily, “First lesson,
Bondo-san! Do not make way for women. Push them,
trample them down. Women have no priority in this country.
You may be polite to very old men, but to no one
else. Is that understood?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, master,” said Bond sarcastically.</p>

<p class="pindent">“And do not make Western-style jokes while you are
my pupil. We are engaged on a serious mission.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh all right, Tiger,” said Bond resignedly. “But damn
it all . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger held up a hand. “And that is another thing. No
swearing, please. There are no swear-words in the Japanese
language, and the usage of bad language does not exist.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“But good heavens, Tiger! No self-respecting man could
get through the day without his battery of four-letter
words to cope with the roughage of life and let off steam.
If you’re late for a vital appointment with your superiors,
and you find that you’ve left all your papers at home,
surely you say, well, Freddie Uncle Charlie Katie, if I may
put it so as not to offend.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No,” said Tiger. “I would say ‘<span class="it">Shimatta</span>,’ which means
‘I have made a mistake.’ ”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Nothing worse?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“There is nothing worse to say.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, supposing it was your driver’s fault that the papers
had been forgotten. Wouldn’t you curse him backwards
and sideways?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“If I wanted to get myself a new driver, I might conceivably
call him ‘<span class="it">bakyaro</span>,’ which means a ‘bloody fool,’
or even ‘<span class="it">konchikisho</span>,’ which means ‘you animal.’ But these
are deadly insults, and he would be within his rights to
strike me. He would certainly get out of the car and walk
away.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“And those are the worst words in the Japanese language!
What about your taboos? The Emperor, your ancestors,
all these gods? Don’t you ever wish them in hell,
or worse?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No. That would have no meaning.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well then, dirty words. Sex words?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“There are two—‘<span class="it">chimbo</span>,’ which is masculine, and
‘<span class="it">monko</span>,’ which is feminine. These are nothing but coarse
anatomical descriptions. They have no meaning as swear-words.
There are no such things in our language.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well I’m . . . I mean, well, I’m astonished! A violent
people without a violent language! I must write a learned
paper on this. No wonder you have nothing left but to
commit suicide when you fail an exam, or cut your girl
friend’s head off when she annoys you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger laughed. “We generally push them under trams
or trains.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, for my money, you’d do much better to say
‘You——,’ ” Bond fired off the hackneyed string, “and get
it off your chest that way.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That is enough, Bondo-san,” said Tiger patiently. “The
subject is now closed. But you will kindly refrain both
from using these words or looking them. Be calm, stoical,
impassive. Do not show anger. Smile at misfortune. If you
sprain your ankle, laugh.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Tiger, you’re a cruel taskmaster.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger grinned with satisfaction. “Bondo-san, you don’t
know the half of it. But now let us go and get something
to eat and drink in the buffet car. All that Suntory you
forced on me last night is crying out for the skin of the
dog that bit me.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“The hair,” corrected Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">“One hair would not be enough, Bondo-san. I need the
whole skin.”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond wrestled with his chopsticks and slivers of
raw octopus and a mound of rice (“You must get accustomed
to the specialities of the country, Bondo-san”) and
watched the jagged coast-line, interspersed with glittering
paddy fields, flash by. He was lost in thought when he felt
a hard jostle from behind. He had been constantly jostled
as he sat up at the counter—the Japanese are great jostlers—but
he now turned and caught a glimpse of the stocky
back of a man disappearing into the next compartment.
There were white strings round his ears which showed that
he was wearing a <span class="it">masko</span>, and he wore an ugly black leather
hat. When they went back to their seat, Bond found that
his pocket had been picked. His wallet was gone. Tiger
was astonished. “That is very unusual in Japan,” he said
defensively. “But no matter. I will get you another at
Toba. It would be a mistake to call the conductor. We do
not wish to draw attention to ourselves. The police would
be sent for at the next station, and there would be much
interrogation and filling out of forms. And there is no
way of finding the thief. The man will have pocketed his
<span class="it">masko</span> and hat and will be unrecognizable. I regret the incident,
Bondo-san. I hope you will forget it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course. It’s nothing.”</p>

<p class="pindent">They left the train at Gamagori, a pretty sea-side village
with a humped island in the bay that Tiger said
housed an important shrine, and the fifty-knot ride in the
hydrofoil to Toba, an hour away across the bay, was exhilarating.
As they disembarked, Bond caught a glimpse
of a stocky silhouette in the crowd. Could it be the thief
on the train? But the man wore heavy horn-rimmed spectacles,
and there were many other stocky men in the
crowd. Bond dismissed the thought and followed Tiger
along the narrow streets, gaily hung with paper banners
and lanterns, to the usual discreet frontage and dwarf
pines that he had become accustomed to. They were expected
and were greeted with deference. Bond had had
about enough of the day. There weren’t many bows and
smiles left in him, and he was glad when he was at last
left alone in his maddeningly dainty room with the usual
dainty pot of tea, dainty cup, and dainty sweetmeat
wrapped in rice-paper. He sat at the open partition that
gave on to a handkerchief of garden and then the sea-wall
and gazed gloomily across the water at a giant statue of
a man in a bowler hat and morning coat that Tiger had
told him was Mr. Mikimoto, founder of the cultured pearl
industry, who had been born at Toba and had there, as a
poor fisherman, invented the trick of inserting grains of
sand under the mantle of a live oyster to form the kernel
of a pearl. Bond thought, To hell with Tiger and his
crazy plan. What in God’s name have I got myself into?
He was still sitting there cursing his lot when Tiger came
in and brusquely ordered him to don one of the <span class="it">yukatas</span>
that hung with the bedding in the single cupboard in the
paper wall.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You really must concentrate, Bondo-san,” said Tiger
mildly. “But you are making progress. As a reward, I have
ordered <span class="it">saké</span> to be brought in large quantities and then a
dinner of the speciality of this place—lobster.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s spirits rose minutely. He undressed to his pants,
donned the dark-brown <span class="it">yukata</span> (“Stop!” from Tiger.
“Wrap it round to the right! Only a corpse wraps it round
to the left.”), and adopted the lotus position across the
low table from Tiger. He had to admit that the kimono
was airy and comfortable. He bowed low. “That sounds
a most sincere programme. Now then, Tiger. Tell me
about the time you were training as a <span class="it">kami-kaze</span>. Every
detail. What was it all about?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The <span class="it">saké</span> came. The pretty waitress knelt on the <span class="it">tatami</span>
and served them both. Tiger had been thoughtful. He had
ordered tumblers. Bond swallowed his at one gulp. Tiger
said, “The grossness of your drinking habits fits well with
your future identity.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“And what is that to be?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“A coal-miner from Fukuoka. There are many tall men
in that profession. Your hands are not rough enough, but
you pushed a truck underground. Your nails will be filled
with coal dust when the time comes. You were too stupid
to wield a pick. You are deaf and dumb. Here,” Tiger
slipped across a scrubby card, creased and dog-eared. There
were some Japanese characters on it. “That is ‘<span class="it">tsumbo de
oshi</span>’—deaf and dumb. Your disability will inspire pity
and some distaste. If someone talks to you, show that and
they will desist. They may also give you a few pieces of
small coin. Accept them and bow deeply.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thanks very much. And I suppose I have to account
for these tips to your secret fund?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That will not be necessary.” Tiger was wooden-faced.
“Our expenses on this mission are a direct charge on the
Prime Minister’s purse.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond bowed. “I am honoured.” He straightened himself.
“And now, you old bastard, more <span class="it">saké</span> and tell me
about the <span class="it">kami-kaze</span>. In due course, I am prepared to become
a deaf-and-dumb miner from Fukuoka. In public,
I am prepared to hiss and bow with the best of them. But,
by God, when we’re alone, the password is Freddie Uncle
Charlie Katie or I’ll be putting my head under a pile-driver
before you get me on to the first tee. Is that
agreed?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger bowed low. “<span class="it">Shimatta!</span> I am in error. I have been
pressing you hard. It is my duty to entertain a friend as
well as instruct a pupil. Lift your glass, Bondo-san. Until
you do so, the girl will not pour. Right. Now you ask
me about the <span class="it">kami-kaze</span>.” Tiger rocked backwards and
forwards, and his dark assassin’s eyes became introspective.
He didn’t look up at Bond. He said, “It was nearly twenty
years ago. Things were looking bad for my country. I had
been doing intelligence work in Berlin and Rome. I had
been far from the air raids and even farther from the
front line, and every night when I listened to the radio
from my homeland and heard the bad news of the slow
but sure approach of the American forces, island by island,
airstrip by airstrip, I paid no attention to the false news
of the Nazis, but thought only that my country was in
danger and that I was needed to defend it.” Tiger paused.
“And the wine turned sour in my mouth and the girls
turned cold in my bed. I listened to the accounts of this
brilliant invention, the corps of <span class="it">kami-kaze</span>. That is the
‘Divine Wind’ that saved my country from invasion by
Kublai Khan in the thirteenth century by destroying his
fleet. I said to myself that that was the way to die—no
medals, total death, suicide if you like, but at enormous
cost to the enemy. It seemed to me the most heroic form
of personal combat that had ever been invented. I was
nearly forty. I had lived fully. It seemed to me that I
could take the place of a younger man. The technique was
simple. Anyone can learn to pilot a plane. The escorts of
fighter planes led in to the attack. It was then just a question
of aiming yourself at the largest ship, preferably an
aircraft carrier that was bringing planes to the islands to
attack the homeland. You got the ship lined up below you
and you went for the flight deck and the lift which is the
heart of a carrier. Pay no attention to the bridge or the
water-line. They are heavily armoured. Go for the vulnerable
machinery of the flight deck. You understand?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger was completely sent. He was back there again
fighting the war. Bond knew the symptoms. He often visited
this haunted forest of memory himself. He lifted his
glass. The kneeling girl bowed and poured. Bond said,
“Yes. Go on, Tiger.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I forced the <span class="it">Kempeitai</span> to accept my resignation and
I returned to Japan and more or less bribed my way into
a <span class="it">kami-kaze</span> training squadron. They were very difficult
to get into. All the youth of the nation seemed to want
to serve the Emperor in this way. At this time we were
running out of aircraft and we were forced to use the
more difficult <span class="it">baku</span>—that was a small plane made mostly
of wood with a thousand pounds of explosive in the nose,
a kind of flying bomb. It had no engine, but was released
from below the belly of a fighter bomber. The pilot had
a single joystick for controlling direction.” Tiger looked
up. “I can tell you, Bondo-san, that it was a terrible and
beautiful thing to see an attack wave going off. These young
men in their pure white shifts, and with the ancient white
scarf that was the badge of the <span class="it">samurai</span> bound round their
heads, running joyfully for their planes as if they were
running to embrace a loved one. The roar of the engines
of the mother planes, and then the take-off into the dawn
or into the setting sun towards some distant target that
had been reported by spies or intercepted on the radio. It
was as if they were flying to their ancestors in heaven, as
indeed they were, for, of course, none ever came back or
were captured.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“But what did it all achieve? Of course it frightened
the American fleet all right, and the British. But you lost
thousands of your best young men. Was it worth it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Is it worth writing one of the most glorious pages in
your country’s history? Do you know that the <span class="it">kami-kaze</span>
is the only unit in the history of air warfare whose claims
were less than the truth? The unit claimed as sunk or
damaged two hundred seventy-six naval craft from aircraft
carriers downwards. Those actually sunk or damaged
were three hundred twenty-two.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You were lucky the surrender came before you were
sent on a mission.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Perhaps. And yet, Bondo-san, it is one of my most
cherished dreams today to come diving out of the sun into
a hail of antiaircraft fire, see the tiny terrified figures running
for shelter from the flight deck of a wildly swerving
carrier, and know that you are about to kill a hundred
or more of the enemy and destroy a million pounds’ worth
of his fighting machine, all by yourself.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“And I suppose Admiral Ohnishi, who invented the
whole idea, committed suicide when the surrender came?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Naturally. And in a most honourable fashion. When
you commit <span class="it">seppuku</span>, you invite two of your best friends
to be present to finish you off if you fail. The admiral executed
the cross-cut from left to right of the belly, and
then the upward cut to the breastbone, most admirably.
But it did not kill him. Yet he refused the coup de grâce.
He sat there contemplating his insides for a whole day
before he finally died. A most sincere gesture of apology
to the Emperor.” Tiger waved a hand airily. “However, I
must not spoil your dinner. I can see that some of our
honourable customs offend your soft Western susceptibilities.
Here comes the lobster. Are they not splendid animals?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Lacquer boxes of rice, raw quails’ eggs in sauce, and
bowls of sliced seaweed were placed in front of them both.
Then they were each given a fine oval dish bearing a large
lobster whose head and tail had been left as a dainty ornament
to the sliced pink flesh in the centre. Bond set to
with his chopsticks. He was surprised to find that the flesh
was raw. He was even more surprised when the head of his
lobster began moving off his dish and, with questing
antennae and scrabbling feet, tottered off across the table.
“Good God, Tiger!” Bond said, aghast. “The damn thing’s
alive!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger hissed impatiently, “Really, Bondo-san. I am much
disappointed in you. You fail test after test. I sincerely
hope you will show improvement during the rest of our
journey. Now eat up and stop being squeamish. This is a
very great Japanese delicacy.”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond bowed ironically. “<span class="it">Shimatta!</span>” he said. “I
have made a mistake. It crossed my mind that honourable
Japanese lobster might not like being eaten alive. Thank
you for correcting the unworthy thought.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You will soon become accustomed to the Japanese way
of life,” said Tiger graciously.</p>

<p class="pindent">“It’s their way of death that’s got me a little bit puzzled,”
said Bond amiably, and he handed his glass to the
kneeling waitress for more <span class="it">saké</span> to give him strength to
try the seaweed.</p>
