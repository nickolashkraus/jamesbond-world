<p class="line8"><span class="sc">And now it</span> was a month later and Mr. Tanaka had become
“Tiger” and Commander Bond had become “Bondo-san.”
Tiger had explained his name for James Bond.
“James,” he had said. “That is a difficult word in Japanese.
And it does not convey sufficient respect. Bond-san is too
much like the Japanese word <span class="it">bon-san</span>, which means a
priest, a greybeard. The hard consonants at the end of
‘Bond’ are also not easy for the Japanese, and when these
occur in a foreign word, we add an O. So you are Bondo-san.
That is acceptable?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Does Bondo mean a pig or anything like that in Japanese?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No. It has no meaning.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Forgive my asking. The Japanese seem to enjoy many
private jokes at the expense of the <span class="it">gaijin</span>. I referred the
other day to a friend of mine called ‘Monkey’ McCall,
whom we used to call ‘Monko.’ You told me that this was
an unmentionable word in your language. So I thought
‘Bondo’ might be equally unmentionable.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Have no fear. It is totally respectable.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The weeks had passed without any significant progress
in Bond’s mission except in the direction of what seemed
to be a genuine friendship between Bond, Tiger, and
Dikko. Outside working hours, the three men became well-nigh
inseparable, but Bond sensed that on their excursions
into the country-side and during their roistering in the
evenings he was being constantly, but with great discretion,
sized up. Dikko had confirmed Bond’s impression.
“I think you’re making progress, champ. Tiger would regard
it as dishonourable to lead you up the garden path
and then pull the rug out from under you with a flat refusal.
Something’s definitely cooking in the background,
but what it is I haven’t the faintest idea. I guess the ball’s
with Tiger’s superiors, but with Tiger on your side. And,
in the vernacular, Tiger’s got what’s called ‘a broad face.’
That means he has great powers as a fixer. And this ON
he’s got in respect of Britain is a huge factor in your
favour. What he gave you on your first meeting was an
unheard-of <span class="it">presento</span>, as we call it here. But watch out!
You’re piling up a great heap of ON in respect of Tiger.
And if it comes to striking a bargain, I hope you’ve got a
pretty massive <span class="it">presento</span> up your sleeve so that the ON
on both sides is more or less evenly balanced. None of this
salmon and shrimp business! Have got? Can do?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m not so sure,” said Bond doubtfully. The Macao
“Blue Route” material had already dwindled in his mind
to the size of a minnow in comparison with the salmon
that was Tiger’s to give or withhold. The impact of the
single slice he had handed Bond had already been formidable.
The test of the 200-megaton bomb had duly taken
place and had been greeted by the public uproar anticipated
by Moscow. But counteraction by the West had
been swift. On the excuse of protecting Soviet personnel in
England from demonstrations of public animosity, they
had been confined within a radius of twenty miles of their
homes, and “for their protection,” police were thick round
the Soviet embassy, the consulates, and their various trading
offices. There had, of course, been reprisals on British
diplomats and journalists in Russia, but these had been expected.
Then President Kennedy had come out with the
strongest speech of his career, and had committed total reprisals
from the United States in the event of a single
nuclear device being exploded by the Soviet Union in any
country in the world outside Soviet territory. This thundering
pronouncement, which had produced a growl of
dismay from the American man-in-the-street, was greeted
from Moscow by the feeble riposte that they would take
similar action in answer to any Western nuclear device exploded
on the territory of the U.S.S.R. or her allies.</p>

<p class="pindent">A few days later Bond had been summoned again to
Tiger’s underground hide-out. “You will not, of course,
repeat this,” Tiger had said with his wicked smile. “But
action in respect of the matter of which you are privately
aware has been indefinitely postponed by the Central
Authority.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thank you for this private information,” Bond had
said. “But you do realize how your kindness of three weeks
ago has greatly alleviated the international tension, particularly
in relation to my country. My country would be
immensely grateful if they knew of your personal generosity
to me. Have I grounds for hoping for your further
indulgence?” Bond had got used to the formalities of Oriental
circumlocution, although he had not yet attained the
refinements of Dikko’s speech with Tiger, which included
at least one four-letter word in each flowery sentence and
which caused Tiger much amusement.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Bondo-san, this implement which you wish to rent
from us, in the most improbable event that it is made
available, will command a very high price. As a fair trader,
what has your country to offer in exchange for the full
use of <span class="sc">magic</span> 44?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“We have a most important intelligence network in
China known as the Macao ‘Blue Route.’ The fruits of this
source would be placed entirely at your disposal.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Melancholy settled over Tiger’s massive face, but deep
down in the Tartar eyes there was a wicked gleam. “I am
very much afraid that I have bad news for you, Bondo-san.
‘Blue Route’ has been penetrated by my organization
almost since its inception. We already receive the entire
fruits of that source. I could show you the files if you wish.
We have simply renamed it ‘Route Orange,’ and I admit
that the material is very acceptable. But we already have
it. What other goods had you in mind for exchange?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had to laugh. The pride of Section J—and of M.,
for that matter! The work, the expense, the danger of running
the “Blue Route.” And at least fifty per cent in aid
of Japan! By God, his eyes were being opened on this
trip. This news would put a fine cat among the pigeons at
H.Q. He said blandly, “We have many other commodities.
Now that you have demonstrated the undoubted value of
your implement, may I suggest that you name your price?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You believe that you have something on your shelves
that is of comparable value? Perhaps material from a similar,
though no doubt inferior, source that would be of
equal importance in the defence of <span class="it">our</span> country?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Undoubtedly,” said Bond staunchly. “But, my dear
Tiger, would it not be a good idea, once your mind is made
up, for you to pay a visit to London and inspect the
shelves for yourself? I am sure my chief would be honoured
to receive you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You do not possess full powers of negotiation?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That would be impossible, my dear Tiger. Our security
is such that even I have not full knowledge of all our
merchandise. So far as I personally am concerned, I am
only in a position to pass on to my chief the substance of
what you say or to render you any other personal services
you might ask of me.”</p>

<p class="pindent">For a moment, Tiger Tanaka looked thoughtful. He
seemed to be turning Bond’s last words over in his mind.
Then he closed the interview with the invitation to the
geisha restaurant, and Bond went off with mixed feelings
to report to Melbourne and London what he had gleaned.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">In the room where he now sat after the geisha party, and
where Tiger had just cheerfully threatened him with death,
tigers’ heads snarled at him from the walls and gnashed at
him from the floor. His ash-tray was enclosed in a stuffed
tiger’s paw and the chair in which he was sitting was upholstered
in tiger’s skin. Mr. Tanaka had been born in
the year of the Tiger, whereas Bond, as Tiger had taken
much pleasure in telling him, had been born in the year
of the Rat.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took a deep drink of <span class="it">saké</span> and said, “My dear Tiger,
I would hate to put you to the inconvenience of having to
remove me from the face of the earth. You mean that this
time the cedar may not bow before the typhoon? So be it.
This time you have my very topmost word of honour.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger pulled up a chair and faced Bond across the low
drink table. He poured himself a liberal tot of Suntory and
splashed in the soda. The sound of night traffic from the
main Tokyo-Yokohama road came in from some way
beyond the surrounding houses, only a few of which now
showed doll’s-house squares of yellow light. It was the
end of September, but warm. It was ten minutes to midnight.
Tiger began talking in a soft voice. “In that case,
my dear Bondo-san, and since I know you to be a man of
honour, except, of course, in matters affecting your country,
which this does not, I will tell you quite an interesting
story. This is how it is.” He got out of his chair and sat
down on the <span class="it">tatami</span> and arranged himself in the lotus
position. He was obviously more comfortable in this posture.
He said, in an expository tone of voice, “Ever since
the beginning of the era of Meiji, who you will know was
the emperor who fathered the modernization and Westernization
of Japan from the beginning of his reign nearly
a hundred years ago, there have from time to time been
foreigners who have come to this country and settled here.
They have for the most part been cranks and scholars, and
the European-born American Lafcadio Hearn, who became
a Japanese citizen, is a very typical example. In general,
they have been tolerated, usually with some amusement.
So, perhaps, would be a Japanese who bought a castle
in the Highlands of Scotland, and who learned and spoke
Gaelic with his neighbours and expressed unusual and
often impertinent interest in Scottish folkways. If he went
about his researches politely and peaceably, he would be
dubbed an amiable eccentric. And so it has been with the
Westerners who have settled and spent their lives in Japan,
though occasionally, in time of war, as would no doubt
be the case with our mythical Japanese in Scotland, they
have been regarded as spies and suffered internment and
hardship. Now, since the occupation, there have been
many such settlers, the great majority of whom, as you
can imagine, have been American. The Oriental way of
life is particularly attractive to the American who wishes
to escape from a culture which, I am sure you will agree,
has become, to say the least of it, more and more unattractive
except to the lower grades of the human species to
whom bad but plentiful food, shiny toys such as the automobile
and the television, and the ‘quick buck,’ often dishonestly
earned, or earned in exchange for minimal labour
or skills, are the <span class="it">summum bonum</span>, if you will allow the
sentimental echo from my Oxford education.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I will,” said Bond. “But is this not a picture of the life
that is being officially encouraged in your own country?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger Tanaka’s face darkened perceptibly. “For the time
being,” he said with distaste, “we are being subjected to
what I can best describe as the ‘Scuola di Coca Cola.’ Baseball,
amusement arcades, hot dogs, hideously large bosoms,
neon lighting—these are part of our payment for defeat
in battle. They are the tepid tea of the way of life we
know under the name of <span class="it">demokorasu</span>. They are a frenzied
denial of the official scapegoats for our defeat—a denial of
the spirit of the <span class="it">samurai</span> as expressed in the <span class="it">kami-kaze</span>, a
denial of our ancestors, a denial of our gods. They are a
despicable way of life”—Tiger almost spat the words—“but
fortunately they are also expendable and temporary.
They have as much importance in the history of Japan as
the life of a dragonfly.” He paused. “But to return to my
story. Our American residents are of a sympathetic type—on
a low level, of course. They enjoy the subservience,
which I may say is only superficial, of our women. They
enjoy the remaining strict patterns of our life—the symmetry,
compared with the chaos that reigns in America.
They enjoy our simplicity, with its underlying hint of
deep meaning, as expressed for instance in the tea ceremony,
flower arrangements, No plays—none of which, of
course, they understand. They also enjoy, because they
have no ancestors and probably no family life worth speaking
of, our veneration of the old and our worship of the
past. For in their impermanent world, they recognize these
as permanent things just as, in their ignorant and childish
way, they admire the fictions of the Wild West and other
American myths that have become known to them, not
through their education, of which they have none, but
through television.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“This is tough stuff, Tiger. I’ve got a lot of American
friends who don’t equate with what you’re saying. Presumably
you’re talking of the lower-level G.I.s—second-generation
Americans who are basically Irish or Germans or
Czechs or Poles who probably ought to be working in the
fields or coal-mines of their countries of origin instead of
swaggering around a conquered country under the blessed
coverlet of the Stars and Stripes with too much money to
spend. I daresay they occasionally marry a Japanese girl
and settle down here. But surely they pull up stumps
pretty quickly. Our Tommies have done the same thing in
Germany. But that’s quite a different thing from the
Lafcadio Hearns of the world.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger Tanaka bowed almost to the ground. “Forgive me,
Bondo-san. Of course, you are right, and I have been
diverted from my story down most unworthy paths. I
did not ask you here to pour out my innermost repugnance
at the occupation of my country. This, of course, is repugnance
against the fact of defeat. I apologize. And, of
course, you are correct. There are many cultured Americans
who have taken up residence in this country and who
are most valued citizens. You are right to correct me, for
I have friends of this nature, in the arts, the sciences, in
literature, and they are indeed valued members of the community.
I was, let us say, letting off steam. You understand?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course, Tiger. My country has not been occupied
for many centuries. The imposition of a new culture on
an old one is something we have not suffered. I cannot
imagine my reactions in the same circumstances. Much the
same as yours, I expect. Please go on with your story.”
Bond reached for the <span class="it">saké</span> flask. It stood in a jar of warm
water being heated over a slow flame from a charcoal
burner. He filled his glass and drank. Tiger Tanaka rocked
two or three times on his buttocks and the sides of his
feet. He resumed.</p>

<p class="pindent">“As I have said, there are a number of foreigners who
have taken up residence in Japan, and for the most part,
they are inoffensive eccentrics. But there is one such person
who entered the country in January of this year who has
revealed himself to be an eccentric of the most devilish
nature. This man is a monster. You may laugh, Bondo-san,
but this man is no less than a fiend in human form.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I have met many bad men in my time, Tiger, and generally
they have been slightly mad. Is that the case in this
instance?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Very much the reverse. The calculated ingenuity of
this man, his understanding of the psychology of my
people, show him to be a man of quite outstanding genius.
In the opinion of our highest scholars and savants, he is
a scientific research worker and collector probably unique
in the history of the world.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What does he collect?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“He collects death.”</p>
