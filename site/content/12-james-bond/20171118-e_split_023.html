<h2 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_37"><span class="calibre1">The Six Guardians</span></h2>

<p class="line8"><span class="sc">The next day</span> was as golden as the first, and the haul of
<span class="it">awabi</span> went up to sixty-eight, largely thanks to Bond’s
improved diving.</p>

<p class="pindent">The evening before, Kissy had come back from selling
her shells at the market and had found Bond writhing on
the floor of his room with cramps in his stomach muscles
and her mother clucking helplessly over him. She had
shooed her mother away, spread the soft <span class="it">futon</span> on the floor
beside him, and had pulled off his bathing pants and rolled
him on to the <span class="it">futon</span> face downwards. Then she had stood
upright on his back and had walked softly up and down
his spine from his buttocks to his neck, and the ache had
slowly gone. She told him to lie still and brought him warm
milk. Then she led him into the tiny bath-house and poured
hot and then tepid water over him from an <span class="it">awabi</span> tub until
all the salt was out of his skin and hair. She dried him
softly, rubbed warm milk into his sunburn and his chafed
hands, and led him back to his room, telling him with
gentle sternness to go to sleep and to call her if he awoke
in the night and needed anything. She blew out his candle
and left him, and he went out, to the night-song of the
cricket in its cage, like a light.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the morning, nothing remained of his aches except
the soreness of the hands, and Kissy gave him the rare treat
of an egg beaten up in his rice and bean curd and he apologized
for his bad manners of the night before. She said,
“Todoroki-san, you have the spirit of ten <span class="it">samurai</span>, but you
have the body of only one. I should have known that I
had asked too much of that single body. It was the pleasure
of the day. It made me forget everything else. So it is I
who apologize, and today we will not go so far. Instead,
we will keep close to the cliffs of the island and see what
we can find. I will do the rowing, for it is a small distance,
but you will be able to do more diving because the place
that I know of, which I haven’t visited for many weeks,
is inshore and the water is, at the most, twenty feet deep.”</p>

<p class="pindent">And so it had been, and Bond had worn a shirt to protect
him from the sun and his tally of shells had gone up to
twenty-one, and the solitary shadow on the day had been
the clear view he had had of the black fortress across the
straits and the chunky yellow-and-black warning balloon
that flew the column of black ideograms above it.</p>

<p class="pindent">During one of their rests, Bond casually asked Kissy what
she knew of the castle, and he was surprised by the way her
face darkened. “Todoroki-san, we do not usually talk about
that place. It is almost a forbidden subject on Kuro. It is as
if hell had suddenly opened its mouth half a mile away
across the sea from our home. And my people, the Ama, are
like what I have read about your gypsies. We are very
superstitious. And we believe the devil himself has come to
live over there.” She didn’t look at the fortress, but gestured
with her head. “Even the <span class="it">kannushi-san</span> does not deny
our fears, and our elders say that the <span class="it">gaijin</span> have always
been bad for Japan and that this one is the incarnation of
all the evil in the West. And there is already a legend that
has grown up on the island. It is that our six <span class="it">Jizo</span> Guardians
will send a man from across the sea to slay this ‘King of
Death,’ as we call him.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Who are these Guardians?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“<span class="it">Jizo</span> is the god who protects children. He is, I think, a
Buddhist god. On the other side of the island, on the foreshore,
there are five statues. The sixth has been mostly
washed away. They are rather frightening to see. They
squat there in a line. They have rough bodies of stone and
round stones for heads and they wear white shirts that are
changed by the people every month. They were put there
centuries ago by our ancestors. They sit on the line of low
tide, and as the tide comes up, it covers them completely,
and they keep watch under the surface of the sea and protect
us, the Ama, because we are known as ‘The Children
of the Sea.’ At the beginning of every June, when the sea
is warm after the winter and the diving begins, every
person on the island forms into a procession and we go
to the Six Guardians and sing to them to make them happy
and favourable towards us.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“And this story of the man from Kuro. Where did it
come from?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Who knows? It could have come from the sea or the
air and thus into the minds of the people. Where do
stories like that come from? It is widely believed.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“<span class="it">Ah, so desu ka!</span>” said Bond, and they both laughed and
got on with the work.</p>

<p class="pindent">On the third day, when Bond was as usual eating his
breakfast on the doorstep, Kissy came to the doorway and
said softly, “Come inside, Todoroki-san.” Mystified, he
went in, and she shut the door behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">She said in a low voice, “I have just heard from a messenger
from the <span class="it">kannushi-san</span> that there were people here
yesterday in a boat from the mainland. They brought
<span class="it">presentos</span>—cigarettes and sweets. They were asking about
the visit of the police boat. They said it came with three
visitors and left with only two. They wanted to know
what had happened to the third visitor. They said they
were guards from the castle and it was their duty to prevent
trespassers. The elders accepted the <span class="it">presentos</span>, but
they showed <span class="it">shiran-kao</span>, which is ‘the face of him who
knows nothing,’ and referred the man to the <span class="it">kannushi-san</span>,
who said that the third visitor was in charge of fishing
licences. He had felt sick on the way to the island and
had perhaps lain down in the boat on the way back. Then
he dismissed the men and sent a boy to the top of the High
Place to see where the boat went, and the boy reported that
it went to the bay beside the castle and was put back into
the boat-house that is there. The <span class="it">kannushi-san</span> thought that
you should know these things.” She looked at him piteously.
“Todoroki-san, I have a feeling of much friendship
for you. I feel that there are secret things between you and
the <span class="it">kannushi-san</span>, and that they concern the castle. I think
you should tell me enough to put me out of my unhappiness.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled. He went up to her and took her face in
both his hands and kissed her on the lips. He said, “You are
very beautiful and kind, Kissy. Today we will not take the
boat out because I must have some rest. Lead me up to the
High Place from which I can take a good look at this
castle and I will tell you what I can. I was going to anyway,
for I shall need your help. Afterwards, I would like
to visit the Six Guardians. They interest me—as an anthropologist.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Kissy collected their usual lunch in a small basket, put
on her brown kimono and rope-soled shoes, and they set
off along a small foot-path that zigzagged up the peak
behind the crouching grey cluster of the village. The time
of the camellia was almost past, but here there were occasional
bushes of wild camellias in red and white, and
there was a profusion of these round a small grove of
dwarf maples, some of which already wore their flaming
autumn colours. The grove was directly above Kissy’s
house. She led him in and showed him the little Shinto
shrine behind a rough stone <span class="it">torii</span>. She said, “Behind the
shrine there is a fine cave, but the people of Kuro are
afraid of it as it is full of ghosts. But I explored it once,
and if there are ghosts there, they are friendly ones.” She
clapped her hands before the shrine, bent her head for a
moment, and clapped them again. Then they went on up
the path to the top of the thousand-foot peak. A brace
of gorgeous copper pheasants with golden tails fled squawking
over the brow and down to a patch of bushes on the
southern cliff as they approached. Bond told Kissy to stay
out of sight while he went and stood behind the tall cairn
of stones on the summit and gazed circumspectly round
it and across the straits.</p>

<p class="pindent">He could see over the high fortress wall and across the
park to the towering black-and-gold donjon of the castle.
It was ten o’clock. There were figures in blue peasant dress
with high boots and long staves moving busily about the
grounds. They occasionally seemed to prod into the bushes
with their staves. They wore black <span class="it">maskos</span> over their
mouths. It crossed Bond’s mind that they might be doing
the morning rounds looking for overnight prey. What
did they do when they found some half-blinded creature,
or a pile of clothes beside one of the fumaroles whose little
clouds of steam rose here and there in the park? Take
them to the Doctor? And, in the case of the living, what
happened then? And when he, Bond, got up that wall
tonight, where was he going to hide from the guards?
Well, sufficient unto the day! At least the straits were
calm and it was cloudless weather. It looked as if he would
get there all right. Bond turned away and went back to
Kissy and sat with her on the sparse turf. He gazed across
the harbour to where the Ama fleet lay sprawled across
the middle distance.</p>

<p class="pindent">He said, “Kissy, tonight I have to swim to the castle
and climb the wall and get inside.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She nodded. “I know this. And then you are going to
kill this man and perhaps his wife. You are the man who
we believe was to come to Kuro from across the sea and
do these things.” She continued to gaze out to sea. She
said dully, “But why have you been chosen? Why should
it not be another, a Japanese?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“These people are <span class="it">gaijin</span>. I am a <span class="it">gaijin</span>. It will cause less
trouble for the state if the whole matter is presented as
being trouble between foreigners.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, I see. And has the <span class="it">kannushi-san</span> given his approval?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“And if . . . And after. Will you come back and be
my boatman again?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“For a time. But then I must go back to England.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No. I believe that you will stay for a long time on
Kuro.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Why do you believe that?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Because I prayed for it at the shrine. And I have never
asked for such a big thing before. I am sure it will be
granted.” She paused. “And I shall be swimming with you
tonight.” She held up a hand. “You will need company
in the dark, and I know the currents. You would not get
there without me.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took the small dry paw in his. He looked at the
childish broken nails. His voice was harsh. He said, “No.
This is man’s work.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked at him. The brown eyes were calm and serious.
She said, and she used his first name, “Taro-san,
your other name may mean thunder, but I am not frightened
of thunder. I have made up my mind. And I shall
come back every night, at midnight exactly, and wait
among the rocks at the bottom of the wall. I shall wait
for one hour in case you need my help in coming home.
These people may harm you. Women are much stronger
in the water than men. That is why it is the Ama girls
who dive and not the Ama men. I know the waters round
Kuro as a peasant knows the fields round his farm, and
I have as little fear of them. Do not be stiff-necked in
this matter. In any case, I shall hardly sleep until you
come back. To feel that I am close to you for a time and
that you may need me will give me some peace. Say yes,
Taro-san.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, all right, Kissy,” said Bond gruffly. “I was only
going to ask you to row me to a starting point down there
somewhere.” He gestured to the left across the straits. “But
if you insist on being an extra target for the sharks . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">“The sharks never trouble us. The Six Guardians look
after that. We never come to any harm. Years ago, one
of the Amas caught her rope in a rock underwater, and
the people have talked of the accident ever since. The
sharks just think we are big fish like themselves.” She
laughed happily. “Now it is all settled and we can have
something to eat and then I will take you down to see
the Guardians. The tide will be low by then, and they
will want to inspect you.”</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">They followed another little path from the summit. It
went over the shoulder of the peak and down to a small
protected bay to the east of the village. The tide was far
out, and they could wade over the flat black pebbles and
rocks and round the corner of the promontory. Here, on
a stretch of flat stony beach, five people squatted on a
square foundation of large rocks and gazed out towards
the horizon. Except that they weren’t people. They were,
as Kissy had described, stone pedestal bodies with large
round boulders cemented to their tops. Rough white shirts
were roped round them, and they looked terrifyingly human
as they sat in immobile judgement and guardianship
over the waters and what went on beneath them. Of the
sixth, only the body remained. His head must have been
destroyed by a storm.</p>

<p class="pindent">They walked round in front of the five and looked up
at the smooth blank faces, and Bond, for the first time
in his life, had a sensation of deep awe. So much belief,
so much authority seemed to have been invested by the
builders in these primitive faceless idols, guardians of the
blithe naked Ama girls, that Bond had a ridiculous urge
to kneel and ask for their blessing as the Crusaders had
once done before their God. He brushed the impulse aside,
but he did bow his head and briefly ask for good fortune
to accompany his enterprise. And then he stood back and
watched with a pull at his heart-strings while Kissy, her
beautiful face strained and pleading, clapped to attract
their attention and then made a long and impassioned
speech in which his name recurred. At the end, when she
again clapped her hands, did the round boulder-heads
briefly nod? Of course not! But when Bond took Kissy’s
hand and they walked away, she said happily, “It is all
right, Todoroki-san. You saw them nod their heads?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No,” said Bond firmly, “I did not.”</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">They crept round the eastern shore of Kuro and pulled
the boat up into a deep cleft in the black rocks. It was
just after eleven o’clock, and the giant moon rode high
and fast through wisps of mackerel cloud. They talked
softly, although they were out of sight of the fortress and
half a mile away from it. Kissy took off her brown kimono
and folded it neatly and put it in the boat. Her body
glowed in the moonlight. The black triangle between her
legs beckoned, and the black string round her waist that
held the piece of material was an invitation to untie it.
She giggled provocatively. “Stop looking at my black cat!”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Why is it called that?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Guess!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond carefully pulled on his <span class="it">ninja</span> suit of black cotton.
It was comfortable enough and would give warmth in the
water. He left the head-shroud hanging down his back
and pushed the goggles that belonged to Kissy’s father up
his forehead. The small floating pack he was to tow behind
him rode jauntily in the waters of the creek, and he
tied its string firmly to his right wrist so that he would
always know it was there.</p>

<p class="pindent">He smiled at Kissy and nodded.</p>

<p class="pindent">She came up to him and threw her arms round his neck
and kissed him full on the lips.</p>

<p class="pindent">Before he could respond, she had pulled down her goggles
and had dived into the quiet mercury sea.</p>
