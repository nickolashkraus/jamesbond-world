<h2 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_34"><span class="calibre1">Appointment in Samarra</span></h2>

<p class="line8"><span class="sc">At six in</span> the morning, a car from the prefect of police
in Fukuoka came for them. There were two police corporals
in the front seat. They went off northwards on the
coast road at a good pace. After a while, Bond said, “Tiger,
we’re being followed. I don’t care what you say. The man
who stole my wallet was in the <span class="it">fugu</span> restaurant last night,
and he’s now a mile behind on a motor-cycle—or I’ll eat
my hat. Be a good chap and tell the driver to dodge up
a side-road and then go after him and get him. I’ve got
a sharp nose for these things and I ask you to do what I
say.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger grunted. He looked back and then issued rapid
instructions to the driver. The driver said, “<span class="it">Hai!</span>” briskly,
and the corporal at his side unbuttoned the holster of his
M-14 automatic. Tiger flexed his powerful fingers.</p>

<p class="pindent">They came to a track on the left which went into the
scrub. The driver did a good racing change and pulled in
out of sight of the road. He cut his engine. They listened.
The roar of a motor-cycle approached and receded. The
driver reversed sharply on to the road and tore off in
pursuit. Tiger issued more sharp instructions. He said to
Bond, “I have told him to try warning the man with his
siren, and if he doesn’t stop, to ride him into the ditch.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, I’m glad you’re giving him a chance,” said Bond,
beginning to have qualms. “I may be wrong, and he may
only be a Fuller brush man in a hurry.”</p>

<p class="pindent">They were doing eighty along the winding road. They
soon came up with the man’s dust, and then there was the
machine itself. The man was hunched over the handlebars,
going like hell.</p>

<p class="pindent">The driver said something. Tiger translated, “He says
it’s a five hundred-cc. Honda. On that, he could easily
get away from us. But even Japanese crooks are men of
discipline. He will prefer to obey the siren.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The siren wailed and then screamed. The white mask
gleamed as the man glanced over his shoulder. He braked
slowly to a stop. His right hand went inside his jacket.
Bond had his hand on the door-latch. He said, “Watch
out, Tiger, he’s got a gun!” and as they pulled up alongside,
he hurled himself out of the door and crashed into
the man, knocking him and his machine to the ground.
The corporal beside the driver took a flying leap, and the
two bodies rolled into the ditch. Almost immediately the
corporal got to his feet. He had a blood-stained knife in
his hand. He threw it aside and tore at the man’s coat
and shirt. He looked up and shook his head. Tiger shouted
something, and the corporal began slapping the man’s face
as hard as he could from side to side. The <span class="it">masko</span> was
knocked off, and Bond recognized the snarling rictus of
death. He said, sickened, “Stop him, Tiger! The man’s
dead.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger walked down into the ditch. He picked up the
man’s knife and bent down and slit the right sleeve of the
corpse up to the shoulder. He looked and then called Bond
down. He pointed to a black figure tattooed in the crook
of the man’s arm. He said, “You were right, Bondo-san.
He is a Black Dragon.” He stood up and, his face contorted,
spat out: “<span class="it">Shimatta!</span>”</p>

<p class="pindent">The two policemen were standing by looking politely
baffled. Tiger gave them orders. They searched the man’s
clothing and extracted various commonplace objects including
Bond’s wallet, with the five thousand yen still intact,
and a cheap diary. They handed everything to Tiger
and then hauled the corpse out of the ditch and stuffed
it roughly into the boot of the car. Then they hid the
motor-cycle in some bushes, and everyone dusted himself
and got back into the car.</p>

<p class="pindent">After a few moments, Tiger said thoughtfully, “It is
incredible! These people must have a permanent tail on
me in Tokyo.” He riffled through the diary. “Yes, all my
movements for the past week and all the stopping-places
on our journey. You are simply described as a <span class="it">gaijin</span>. But
he could have telephoned a description. This is indeed an
unfortunate business, Bondo-san. I apologize most deeply.
You may already be incriminated. I will naturally absolve
you from your mission. It is entirely my fault for being
careless. I have not been taking these people seriously
enough. I must talk with Tokyo as soon as we get to
Fukuoka. But at least you have seen an example of
the measures Doctor Shatterhand takes for his protection.
There is certainly more to this man than meets the eye.
At some time in his life, he must have been an experienced
intelligence agent. To have discovered my identity,
for instance, which is a state secret. To have recognized
me as his chief enemy. To have taken the appropriate
countermeasures to ensure his privacy. This is either a great
madman or a great criminal. You agree, Bondo-san?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Looks quite like it. I’m really getting keen to have a
sight of the fellow. And don’t worry about the mission.
This was probably just the jolt I needed to get the wind
under my tail.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The headquarters of the local department of the <span class="it">Sosaka</span>,
the C.I.D., for the southern island of Kyushu, was just
off the main street of Fukuoka. It was a stern-looking
building in yellow lavatory brick in a style derived from
the German. Tiger confirmed that it had been the headquarters
of the <span class="it">Kempeitai</span>, the Japanese Gestapo, before
and during the war. Tiger was received with pomp. The
office of the chief of the C.I.D. was small and cluttered.
Superintendent Ando himself looked to Bond like any other
Japanese salary-man, but he had a military bearing and
the eyes behind the rimless spectacles were quick and hard.
Bond sat patiently smoking while much conversation went
on. A blown-up aerial mosaic of the Castle of Death and
the surrounding country was produced from a filing cabinet
and laid out on the desk. Superintendent Ando weighted
down the corners with ash-trays and other hardware and
Tiger called him over with a respect, Bond noticed, that
was not lost on the superintendent. It crossed Bond’s mind
that he had heaped much ON on Tiger, or alternatively
that Tiger had lost much face vis-à-vis Bond by the business
of the Black Dragon agent. Tiger said, “Please examine
this photograph, Bondo-san. The superintendent
says that a clandestine approach from the landward side
is now very difficult. The suicides pay local peasants to
lead them through these marshlands,” he pointed, “and
there are recognized breaches in the walls surrounding the
property which are constantly changed and kept open for
the suicides. Every time the superintendent posts a guard
at one of them, another is made known to the peasants
by the castle guards. He says he is at his wits’ end. Twenty
bodies have been fetched to the mortuary in the past week.
The superintendent wishes to hand in his resignation.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Naturally,” said Bond. “And then perhaps honourable
<span class="it">fugu</span> poisoning. Let’s have a look.”</p>

<p class="pindent">At first glance, Bond’s heart quailed. He might just as
well try and storm Windsor Castle single-handed! The
estate covered the whole expanse of a small promontory
that jutted out into the sea from a rocky coast, and the
two-hundred-foot cliff round the promontory had been
revetted with giant stone blocks down to the breaking
waves to form an unbroken wall that sloped slightly up
to gun-ports and the irregularly sited tiled watch-towers.
From the top of this wall there appeared to be a ten-foot
drop into the park, heavily treed and shrubbed between
winding streams and a broad lake with a small island in
its centre. Steam appeared to be rising from the lake, and
there were occasional wisps of it among the shrubbery. At
the back of the property stood the castle, protected from
the low-lying country-side by a comparatively modest
wall. It would be over this wall that the suicides gained
access. The castle itself was a giant five-storeyed affair in
the Japanese tradition, with swooping winged roofs of
glazed tile. Dolphin-shaped finials decorated the topmost
storey, and there was a profusion of other decorative devices,
small balconies, isolated turrets and gazebos so that
the whole black-painted edifice, edged here and there with
what Tiger said was gold paint, gave the impression of a
brilliant attempt to make a stage setting for Dracula. Bond
picked up a large magnifying glass and ran over the whole
property inch by inch, but there was nothing more to be
gleaned except the presence of an occasional diminutive
figure at work in the park or raking the gravel round the
castle.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laid down the glass. He said gloomily, “That’s not
a castle! That’s a fortress! How am I supposed to get into
the bloody place?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“The superintendent asks if you are a good swimmer. I
have had a complete outfit sent down from my <span class="it">ninjutsu</span>
establishment. The seaward wall would present no problems.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I can swim well enough, but how do I get to the base
of the wall? Where do I start from?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“The superintendent says there is an Ama island called
Kuro only half a mile out to sea.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What’s an Ama island?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“They exist at different places round Japan. I believe
there are some fifty such settlements. The Ama are a tribe
whose girls dive for the <span class="it">awabi</span> shells—that is our local
abalone. A clam. It is a great delicacy. They sometimes
dive for pearl oysters. They dive naked. Some of them
are very beautiful. But they keep themselves very much
to themselves, and visitors to their islands are completely
discouraged. They have their own primitive culture and
customs. I suppose you could compare them to sea-gypsies.
They rarely marry outside the tribe, and it is that which
has made them a race apart.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sounds intriguing, but how am I going to make a base
on this Kuro Island? I may have to wait days for the
weather to be right.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger spoke rapidly to the superintendent, and there
was a lengthy reply. “<span class="it">Ah, so desu ka!</span>” said Tiger with
interest and enthusiasm. He turned to Bond. “It seems
that the superintendent is distantly related to a family on
Kuro. It is a most interesting family. There is a father and
a mother and one daughter. She is called Kissy Suzuki. I
have heard of her. When she was seventeen, she became
famous in Japan by being chosen to go to Hollywood to
make a film. They wanted a Japanese diving girl of great
beauty, and someone had heard of her. She made the film,
but hated Hollywood and longed only to return to her
Ama life. She could have made a fortune, but she retired
to this obscure island. There was a great to-do in the press
at the time, and it was judged that she had behaved most
honourably. They christened her ‘The Japanese Garbo.’
But Kissy will now be twenty-three, and everyone has forgotten
about her. The superintendent says that he could
arrange for you to stay with this family. They seem to
have some obligation towards him. He says it is a simple
house, but comfortable because of the money this girl
earned in Hollywood. The other houses on the island are
nothing but fishermen’s shacks.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“But won’t the rest of the community resent me being
there?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No. The people of the island belong to the Shinto religion.
The superintendent will speak to the Shinto priest
and everything will be okay.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“All right, so I stay on this island and then one night
I swim across to the wall. How do I get up it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You will have the <span class="it">ninja</span> outfit. It is here. You have
seen how it is used. You will use it. It is very simple.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“As I saw from the man who fell into the moat. Then
what do I do?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You hide up in the grounds and wait for an opportunity
to kill him. How you do that is up to you. As I told
you, he goes about in armour. A man in armour is very
vulnerable. You only have to knock him off his feet. Then
you will throttle him with the <span class="it">ninja</span> chain you will be
wearing round your waist. If his wife is with him, you
will throttle her, too. She is certainly involved in all this
business, and anyway she is too ugly to live. Then you
escape over the wall and swim back to Kuro. There you
will be picked up by the police launch, which will visit
the place at once. The news of the death will quickly get
round.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said doubtfully, “Well, it all sounds very simple.
But what about these guards? The place is crawling with
them.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You must just keep out of their way. As you can see,
the park is full of hiding-places.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thanks very much. In one of those poison bushes or
up one of those trees. I don’t want to blind myself or go
mad.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“The <span class="it">ninja</span> clothing will give you complete protection.
You will have a black suit for night and a camouflage one
for the day. You will wear the swimming goggles to protect
your eyes. All this equipment you will tow over in a
plastic bag, which will be provided.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“My dear Tiger, you’ve thought of everything. But I’d
much rather have just one little gun.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That would be crazy, Bondo-san. You know perfectly
well that silence will be essential. And with a silencer,
which would be very heavy to swim with, the speed of
the bullet would be so much reduced that you might not
pierce the armour. No, my friend. Use <span class="it">ninjutsu</span>. It is the
only way.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh all right,” said Bond resignedly. “Now let’s have a
look at a photograph of this chap. Has the superintendent
got one?”</p>

<p class="pindent">It had been taken from a long way away with a telephoto
lens. It showed a giant figure in full medieval chain
armour with the jagged, winged helmet of ancient Japanese
warriors. Bond studied the photograph carefully, noting
the vulnerable spots at neck and joints. A metal shield
protected the man’s groin. A wide-bladed <span class="it">samurai</span> sword
hung from his waist, but there was no sign of any other
weapon. Bond said thoughtfully, “He doesn’t look as daft
as he ought to. Probably because of the Dracula setting.
Have you got one of his face? Perhaps he looks a bit
madder in the raw.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The superintendent went to the bottom of his file, extracted
what looked like a blown-up copy of Doctor Guntram
Shatterhand’s passport photograph, and handed it
over.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took it nonchalantly. Then his whole body stiffened.
He said to himself, <span class="it">God Almighty! God Almighty!</span>
Yes. There was no doubt, no doubt at all! He had grown
a drooping black moustache. He had had the syphilitic
nose repaired. There was a gold-capped tooth among the
upper frontals, but there could be no doubt. Bond looked
up. He said, “Have you got one of the woman?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Startled by the look of controlled venom on Bond’s
face, and by the pallor that showed through the walnut
dye, the superintendent bowed energetically and scrabbled
through his file.</p>

<p class="pindent">Yes, there she was, the bitch—the flat ugly wardress
face, the dull eyes, the scraped-back bun of hair.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond held the pictures, not looking at them, thinking.
Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Irma Bunt. So this was where they
had come to hide! And the long strong gut of fate had
lassoed him to them! They of all people! He of all people!
A taxi-ride down the coast in this remote corner of
Japan. Could they smell him coming? Had the dead spy
got hold of his name and told them? Unlikely. The power
and prestige of Tiger would have protected him. Privacy,
discretion, are the heartbeat of Japanese inns. But would
they know that an enemy was on his way? That fate had
arranged this appointment in Samarra? Bond looked up
from the pictures. He was in cold control of himself. This
was now a private matter. It had nothing to do with Tiger
or Japan. It had nothing to do with <span class="sc">magic</span> 44. It was
ancient feud. He said casually, “Tiger, could the superintendent
inquire what his detectives have made of that
Black Dragon agent? And of his belongings? I am particularly
interested to know whether he may have telephoned
or telegraphed my description or my purpose in
coming down here.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a long and electric silence in the room. Tiger
examined Bond’s face with piercing interest before he
passed the inquiry on to the superintendent. The superintendent
picked up the receiver of an old-fashioned telephone
on a double hook. He spoke into it, then, a Japanese
habit, blew sharply into the mouthpiece to clear the
line, and spoke again at length. He said, “<span class="it">Ah, so desu ka!</span>”
many times. Then he put down the receiver. When he had
finished talking, Tiger turned to Bond. Again with the
same piercing appraisal of Bond’s face, he said, “The man
came from these parts. He has a police record. Fortunately,
he was poorly educated and is known as nothing more
than a stupid thug. On the first page of the diary he wrote
down his assignment, which was only to follow me to my
destination and then report to his master. It seems unlikely
that he was authorized to communicate before then. But
what is it, Bondo-san? Is it that you know these people?”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond laughed. It was a laugh that grated. Even
to Bond, it sounded harsh and false in the small room. He
had immediately made up his mind to keep his knowledge
to himself. To reveal the true identity of Doctor Shatterhand
would be to put the whole case back into official
channels. The Japanese secret service and the C.I.A. would
swarm down to Fukuoka. Blofeld and Irma Bunt would
be arrested. James Bond’s personal prey would be snatched
from him. There would be no revenge! Bond said, “Good
lord, no! But I am something of a physiognomist. When
I saw this man’s face, it was as if someone had walked over
my grave. I have a feeling that, whether I succeed or not,
the outcome of this mission is going to be decisive for one
or the other of us. It will not be a drawn game. But now
I have a number of further questions with which I must
worry you and the superintendent. They are small matters
of detail, but I want to get everything right before I
start.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger looked relieved. The raw animalism in Bond’s face
had been so different from the stoical, ironical face of the
Bondo-san for whom he had come to have so much affection.
He gave his great golden smile and said, “But of
course, my friend. And I am pleased with your worries
and with the trouble you are taking to make sure of everything
in advance. You will forgive me if I quote you one
last Japanese proverb. It says, ‘A reasonable number of
fleas is good for a dog. Otherwise the dog forgets he is a
dog.’ ”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Good old Basshō!” said Bond.</p>
