<h2 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_23"><span class="calibre1">Scissors Cut Paper</span></h2>

<p class="line8"><span class="sc">The geisha called</span> “Trembling Leaf,” on her knees beside
James Bond, leant forward from the waist and kissed
him chastely on the right cheek.</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s a cheat,” said Bond severely. “You agreed that if
I won it would be a real kiss on the mouth. At the very
least,” he added.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Grey Pearl,” the madame, who had black lacquered
teeth, a bizarre affectation, and was so thickly made up
that she looked like a character out of a No play, translated.
There was much giggling and cries of encouragement.
Trembling Leaf covered her face with her pretty
hands as if she were being required to perform some ultimate
obscenity. But then the fingers divided and the pert
brown eyes examined Bond’s mouth, as if taking aim, and
her body lanced forward. This time the kiss was full on the
lips, and it lingered fractionally. In invitation? In promise?
Bond remembered that he had been promised a “pillow
geisha.” Technically, this would be a geisha of low
caste. She would not be proficient in the traditional arts
of her calling—she would not be able to tell humorous
stories, sing, paint, or compose verses about her patron.
But, unlike her cultured sisters, she might agree to perform
more robust services—discreetly, of course, in conditions
of the utmost privacy and at a high price. But to the
boorish, brutalized tastes of a <span class="it">gaijin</span>, a foreigner, this made
more sense than having a <span class="it">tanka</span> of thirty-one syllables,
which in any case he couldn’t understand, equate, in exquisite
language, his charms with budding chrysanthemums
on the slopes of Mount Fuji.</p>

<p class="pindent">The applause which greeted this unbridled exhibition of
lasciviousness died quickly and respectfully. The powerful
chunky man in the black <span class="it">yukata</span>, sitting directly across the
low red lacquer table from Bond, had taken the Dunhill
filter holder from between his golden teeth and had laid it
beside his ash-tray. “Bondo-san,” said Tiger Tanaka, head
of the Japanese Secret Service, “I will now challenge you
to this ridiculous game, and I promise you in advance that
you will not win.” The big creased brown face that Bond
had come to know so well in the past month split expansively.
The wide smile closed the almond eyes to slits—slits
that glittered. Bond knew that smile. It wasn’t a smile. It
was a mask with a golden hole in it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. “All right, Tiger. But first, more <span class="it">saké</span>!
And not in these ridiculous thimbles. I’ve drunk five flasks
of the stuff and its effect is about the same as one double
martini. I shall need another double martini if I am to
go on demonstrating the superiority of Western instinct
over the wiles of the Orient. Is there such a thing as a
lowly glass tumbler discarded in some corner behind the
cabinets of Ming?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Bondo-san. Ming is Chinese. Your knowledge of porcelain
is as meagre as your drinking habits are gross.
Moreover, it is unwise to underestimate <span class="it">saké</span>. We have a
saying, ‘It is the man who drinks the first flask of <span class="it">saké</span>;
then the second flask drinks the first; then it is the <span class="it">saké</span>
that drinks the man.’ ” Tiger Tanaka turned to Grey
Pearl, and there followed a laughing conversation which
Bond interpreted as jokes at the expense of this uncouth
Westerner and his monstrous appetites. At a word from
the madame, Trembling Leaf bowed low and scurried out
of the room. Tiger turned to Bond. “You have gained
much face, Bondo-san. It is only the <span class="it">sumo</span> wrestlers who
drink <span class="it">saké</span> in these quantities without showing it. She says
you are undoubtedly an eight-flask man.” Tiger’s face became
sly. “But she also suggests that you will not make
much of a companion for Trembling Leaf at the end of
the evening.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Tell her that I am more interested in her own more
mature charms. She certainly possesses talents in the art
of love-making which would overcome any temporary lassitude
on my part.”</p>

<p class="pindent">This leaden gallantry got what it deserved. There came
a spirited crackle of Japanese from Grey Pearl. Tiger translated.
“Bondo-san, this is a woman of some wit. She has
made a joke. She says she is already respectably married to
one <span class="it">bon-san</span> and there is no room in her <span class="it">futon</span> for another.
<span class="it">Bon-san</span> means a priest, a greybeard. <span class="it">Futon</span>, as you know,
is bedding. She has made a joke on your name.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The geisha party had been going on for two hours, and
Bond’s jaws were aching with the unending smiles and
polite repartee. Far from being entertained by the geisha,
or bewitched by the inscrutable discords issuing from the
catskin-covered box of the three-stringed <span class="it">samisen</span>, Bond
had found himself having to try desperately to make the
party go. He also knew that Tiger Tanaka had been observing
his efforts with a sadistic pleasure. Dikko Henderson
had warned him that geisha parties were more or less the
equivalent, for a foreigner, of trying to entertain a lot of
unknown children in a nursery with a strict governess, the
madame, looking on. But Dikko had also warned him that
he was being done a great honour by Tiger Tanaka, that
the party would cost Tiger a small fortune, whether from
secret funds or from his own pocket, and that Bond had
better put a good face on the whole thing since this looked
like a break-through in Bond’s mission. But it could equally
well be disaster.</p>

<p class="pindent">So now Bond smiled and clapped his hands in admiration.
He said to Tiger, “Tell the old bitch she’s a clever
old bitch,” accepted the brimming tumbler of hot <span class="it">saké</span>
from the apparently adoring hands of Trembling Leaf,
and downed it in two tremendous gulps. He repeated the
performance so that more <span class="it">saké</span> had to be fetched from the
kitchen, then he placed his fist decisively on the red lacquer
table and said with mock belligerence, “All right, Tiger!
Go to it!”</p>

<p class="pindent">It was the old game of Scissors cut Paper, Paper wraps
Stone, Stone blunts Scissors, that is played by children all
over the world. The fist is the Stone, two outstretched
fingers are the Scissors, and a flat hand is the Paper. The
closed fist is hammered twice in the air simultaneously by
the two opponents, and at the third downward stroke, the
chosen emblem is revealed. The game consists of guessing
which emblem the opponent will choose, and of you yourself
choosing one that will defeat him. Best of three goes
or more. It is a game of bluff.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger Tanaka rested his fist on the table opposite Bond.
The two men looked carefully into each other’s eyes. There
was dead silence in the box-like little lath-and-paper room,
and the soft gurgling of the tiny brook in the ornamental
square of garden outside the opened partition could be
heard clearly for the first time that evening. Perhaps it
was this silence, after all the talk and giggling, or perhaps
it was the deep seriousness and purpose that was suddenly
evident in Tiger Tanaka’s formidable, cruel, <span class="it">samurai</span> face,
but Bond’s skin momentarily crawled. For some reason this
had become more than a children’s game. Tiger had promised
he would beat Bond. To fail would be to lose much
face. How much? Enough to breach a friendship that had
become oddly real between the two of them over the past
weeks? This was one of the most powerful men in Japan.
To be defeated by a miserable <span class="it">gaijin</span> in front of the two
women might be a matter of great moment to this man.
The defeat might leak out through the women. In the West,
such a trifle would be farcically insignificant, like a cabinet
minister losing a game of backgammon at Blades. But in the
East? In a very short while, Dikko Henderson had taught
Bond total respect for Oriental conventions, however old-fashioned
or seemingly trivial, but Bond was still at sea in
their gradations. This was a case in point. Should Bond try
and win at this baby game of bluff and double-bluff, or
should he try to lose? But to try and lose involved the same
cleverness at correctly guessing the other man’s symbols in
advance. It was just as difficult to lose on purpose as to win.
And anyway, did it really matter? Unfortunately, on the
curious assignment in which James Bond was involved, he
had a nasty feeling that even this idiotic little gambit had
significance towards success or failure.</p>

<p class="pindent">As if with second sight, Tiger Tanaka spelled the problem
out. He gave a harsh taut laugh that was more of a shout
than an expression of humour or pleasure. “Bondo-san, with
us, and certainly at a party at which I am the host and you
are the honoured guest, it would be good manners for me
to let you win this game that we are to play together. It
would be more. It would be required behaviour. So I must
ask your forgiveness in advance for defeating you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled cheerfully. “My dear Tiger, there is no point
in playing a game unless you try to win. It would be a very
great insult to me if you endeavoured to play to lose. But if
I may say so, your remarks are highly provocative. They are
like the taunts of the <span class="it">sumo</span> wrestlers before the bout. If I
was not myself so certain of winning, I would point out
that you spoke in English. Please tell our dainty and distinguished
audience that I propose to rub your honourable
nose in the dirt at this despicable game and thus display
not only the superiority of Great Britain, and particularly
Scotland, over Japan, but also the superiority of our Queen
over your Emperor.” Bond, encouraged perhaps by the
crafty ambush of the <span class="it">saké</span>, had committed himself. This
kind of joking about their different cultures had become
a habit between himself and Tiger, who, with a first in
P.P.E. at Trinity before the war, prided himself in the
<span class="it">demokorasu</span> of his outlook and the liberality and breadth
of his understanding of the West. But Bond, having
spoken, caught the sudden glitter in the dark eyes, and he
thought of Dikko Henderson’s cautionary, “Now listen,
you stupid limey bastard. You’re doing all right. But
don’t press your luck. T.T.’s a civilized kind of a chap—as
Japs go, that is. But don’t overdo it. Take a look at that
mug. There’s Manchu there, and Tartar. And don’t forget
the so-an-so was a Black Belt at judo before he ever went
up to your bloody Oxford. And don’t forget he was spying
for Japan when he called himself assistant naval attaché
in their London embassy before the war, and you stupid
bastards thought he was okay because he’d got a degree at
Oxford. And don’t forget his war record. Don’t forget
he ended up as personal aide to Admiral Ohnishi and was
training as a <span class="it">kami-kaze</span> when the Americans made loud
noises over Nagasaki and Hiroshima and the Rising Sun
suddenly took a backward somersault into the sea. And if
you forget all that, just ask yourself why it’s T.T. rather
than any other of the ninety million Japanese who happens
to hold down the job as head of the <span class="it">Kōan-Chōsa-Kyōku</span>.
Okay, James? Got the photo?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Since Bond had arrived in Japan he had assiduously practised
sitting in the lotus position. Dikko Henderson had
advised it. “If you make the grade with these people,” he
had said, “or even if you don’t, you’ll be spending a lot
of time sitting on your ass on the ground. There’s only
one way to do it without cracking your joints—that’s in
the Indian position, squatting with your legs crossed and
the sides of your feet hurting like hell on the floor. It takes
a bit of practice, but it won’t kill you and you’ll end up
gaining plenty of face.” Bond had more or less mastered
the art, but now, after two hours, his knee-joints were on
fire and he felt that if he didn’t alter his posture he would
end up bandy-legged for life. He said to Tiger, “Playing
against a master such as yourself, I must first adopt a
relaxed position so that my brain may be totally concentrated.”
He got painfully to his feet, stretched, and sat
down again—this time with one leg extended under the
low table and with his left elbow resting on the bent knee
of the other. It was a blessed relief. He lifted his tumbler
and, obediently, Trembling Leaf filled it from a fresh
flagon. Bond downed the <span class="it">saké</span>, handed the tumbler to the
girl, and suddenly crashed his right fist down on the lacquer
table so that the little boxes of sweetmeats rattled and the
porcelain tinkled. He looked belligerently across at Tiger
Tanaka. “Right!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger bowed. Bond bowed back. The girl leant forward
expectantly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger’s eyes bored into Bond’s, trying to read his plan.
Bond had decided to have no plan, display no pattern. He
would play completely at random, showing the symbol
that his fist decided to make at the psychological moment
after the two hammer blows.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger said, “Three games of three?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Right.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The two fists rose slowly from the table top, quickly
hammered twice in unison, and shot forward. Tiger had
kept his fist balled in the Stone. Bond’s palm was open
in the Paper that wrapped the Stone. One up to Bond.
Again the ritual and the moment of truth. Tiger had kept
to the Stone. Bond’s first and second fingers were open in
the Scissors, blunted by Tiger’s Stone. One all.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger paused and placed his fist against his forehead. He
closed his eyes in thought. He said, “Yes. I’ve got you,
Bondo-san. You can’t escape.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Good show,” said Bond, trying to clear his mind of the
suspicion that Tiger would keep to the Stone, or alternatively,
that Tiger would expect him to play it that way,
expect Bond to play the Paper and himself riposte with the
Scissors to cut the Paper. And so on and so forth. The three
emblems whirled round in Bond’s mind like the symbols
on a fruit machine.</p>

<p class="pindent">The two fists were raised—one, two, forward!
Tiger had kept to his Stone. Bond had wrapped it up
with the Paper. First game to Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">The second game lasted longer. They both kept on showing
the same symbol, which meant a replay. It was as if the
two players were getting the measure of each other’s psychology.
But that could not be so, since Bond had no
psychological intent. He continued to play at random. It
was just luck. Tiger won the game. One all.</p>

<p class="pindent">Last game! The two contestants looked at each other.
Bond’s smile was bland, rather mocking. A glint of red
shone in the depths of Tiger’s dark eyes. Bond saw it and
said to himself, “I would be wise to lose. Or would I?” He
won the game in two straight goes, blunting Tiger’s Scissors
with his Stone, wrapping Tiger’s Stone with his Paper.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger bowed low. Bond bowed even lower. He sought
for a throwaway remark. He said, “I must get this game
adopted in time for your Olympics. I would certainly be
chosen to play for my country.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger Tanaka laughed with controlled politeness. “You
play with much insight. What was the secret of your
method?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had had no method. He quickly invented the one
that would be most polite to Tiger. “You are a man of
rock and steel, Tiger. I guessed that the paper symbol would
be the one you would use the least. I played accordingly.”</p>

<p class="pindent">This bit of mumbo-jumbo got by. Tiger bowed. Bond
bowed and drank more <span class="it">saké</span>, toasting Tiger. Released from
the tension, the geisha applauded and the madame instructed
Trembling Leaf to give Bond another kiss. She
did so. How soft the skins of Japanese women were! And
their touch was almost weightless! James Bond was plotting
the rest of his night when Tiger said, “Bondo-san,
I have matters to discuss with you. Will you do me the
honour of coming to my house for a nightcap?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond immediately put away his lascivious thoughts. According
to Dikko, to be invited to a Japanese private house
was a most unusual sign of favour. So, for some reason,
he had done right to win this childish game. This might
mean great things. Bond bowed. “Nothing would give
me more pleasure, Tiger.”</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">An hour later, they were sitting in blessed chairs with
a drink-tray between them. The lights of Yokohama
glowed a deep orange along the horizon, and a slight smell
of the harbour and the sea came in through the wide-open
partition leading on to the garden. Tiger’s house was designed,
enchantingly, as is even the meanest Japanese salary-man’s
house, to establish the thinnest possible dividing line
between the inhabitant and nature. The three other partitions
in the square room were also fully slid back, revealing
a bedroom, a small study, and a passage.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger had opened the partitions when they entered the
room. He had commented, “In the West, when you have
secrets to discuss, you shut all the doors and windows. In
Japan, we throw everything open to make sure that no one
can listen at the thin walls. And what I have now to discuss
with you is a matter of the very highest secrecy. The <span class="it">saké</span>
is warm enough? You have the cigarettes you prefer? Then
listen to what I have to say to you and swear on your
honour to divulge it to no one.” Tiger Tanaka gave his
great golden shout of mirthless laughter. “If you were to
break your promise, I would have no alternative but to
remove you from the earth.”</p>
