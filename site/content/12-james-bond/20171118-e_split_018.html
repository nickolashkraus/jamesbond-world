<p class="line8"><span class="sc">To Bond’s unspeakable</span> relief, they put up that night
at the smartest hotel in Kyoto, the Miyako. The comfortable
bed, air-conditioning, and Western-style lavatory on
which one could actually sit were out of this world. Better
still, Tiger said that unfortunately he had to dine with the
chief of police of the prefecture and Bond ordered a pint
of Jack Daniels and a double portion of eggs Benedict to
be brought up to his room. Then, from a belated sense
of duty, he watched “The Seven Detectives,” a famous
Japanese television series, failed to spot the villain, and
went to bed and slept for twelve hours.</p>

<p class="pindent">The next morning, hungover and conscience-stricken,
he obediently fell in with Tiger’s plans that they should
visit the oldest whore-house in Japan before a quick drive
to Osaka for the day’s journey across the Inland Sea to
the southern island of Kyushu. “Bit early for visiting a
whore-house,” had been his only comment.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger laughed. “It is a matter of deep regret to me that
your baser instincts should always be in the ascendancy,
Bondo-san. Prostitution is now illegal in Japan. What we
are about to visit is a national monument.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, good show!”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a deal of bowing and hissing at the whore-house,
a spacious establishment in the now defunct red
lamp street of the ancient capital, and they were presented
with handsomely bound descriptive booklets by the earnest
curator. They wandered over polished floors from chamber
to chamber and gravely inspected the sword cuts in the
wooden supports that had been inflicted, according to
Tiger, by <span class="it">samurai</span> infuriated by lust and impatience. Bond
inquired how many actual bedrooms there had been. It
seemed to him that the whole place was taken up by a
vast kitchen and many dining-rooms.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Four rooms,” answered the curator.</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s no way to run a whore-house,” commented
Bond. “You need quick through-put, like a casino.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Bondo-san,” complained Tiger. “Please try and put
out of your mind comparisons between our way of life
and yours. In former times, this was a place of rest and
recreation. Food was served and there was music and story-telling.
People would write <span class="it">tankas</span>. Take that inscription
on the wall. It says ‘Everything is new tomorrow.’ Some
man with a profound mind will have written that.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Then he threw his pen away and reached for his sword
and shouted, ‘When is room No. 4 going to be empty?’
National monument indeed! It’s like in the new African
states where they pretend the cannibal stewpot in the
chief’s hut was for cooking yams for the hungry children.
Everyone tries to forget his rowdy past instead of being
proud of it. Like we are of Bloody Morgan, or Nell
Gwynne, for instance. The great murderer and the great
whore are part of our history. You shouldn’t try and pretend
that your oldest whore-house is a sort of Stratford-on-Avon.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger uttered an explosive laugh. “Bondo-san, your comments
on our Japanese way of life become more and more
outrageous. Come, it is time to cleanse your mind in the
salubrious breezes of the Inland Sea.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The <span class="it">Murasaki Maru</span> was a very modern 3000-ton ship
with all the luxuries of an ocean liner. Crowds waved her
good-bye as if the ship was setting off across the Atlantic
instead of doing a day trip down the equivalent of a long
lake. There was much throwing of paper streamers by
groups bearing placards to show whom they represented—business
outings, schools, clubs—part of the vast travelling
population of Japan, for ever on the move, making an
outing, visiting relatives or shrines, or just seeing the sights
of the country. The ship throbbed grandly through the
endless horned islands. Tiger said that there were fine whirlpools
“like great lavatory pans, specially designed for suicides”
between some of these. Meanwhile, Tiger and Bond
sat in the first-class dining-room and consumed “Hamlets”—ham
omelets—and <span class="it">saké</span>. Tiger was in a lecturing mood.
He was determined to correct Bond’s boorish ignorance of
Japanese culture. “Bondo-san, I wonder if I will ever get
you to appreciate the nuances of the Japanese <span class="it">tanka</span>, or of
the <span class="it">haiku</span>, which are the classical forms of Japanese verse.
Have you ever heard of Basshō, for instance?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No,” said Bond with polite interest. “Who’s he?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Just so,” said Tiger bitterly. “And yet you would
think me grossly uneducated if I had never heard of
Shakespeare, Homer, Dante, Cervantes, Goethe. And yet
Basshō, who lived in the seventeenth century, is the equal
of any of them.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What did he write?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“He was an itinerant poet. He was particularly at home
with the <span class="it">haiku</span>, the verse of seventeen syllables.” Tiger
assumed a contemplative expression. He intoned:</p>


          <div class="poetry-container">
          <div class="lgp"> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class="lgl">
<p class="line7">“In the bitter radish</p>
<p class="line7">that bites into me, I feel</p>
<p class="line7">the autumn wind.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class="line8">“Does that not say anything to you? Or this:</p>


          <div class="poetry-container">
          <div class="lgp"> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class="lgl">
<p class="line7">“The butterfly is perfuming</p>
<p class="line7">its wings, in the scent</p>
<p class="line7">of the orchid.</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class="line8">“You do not grasp the beauty of that image?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Rather elusive, compared to Shakespeare.”</p>


          <div class="poetry-container">
          <div class="lgp"> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class="lgl">
<p class="line7">“In the fisherman’s hut</p>
<p class="line7">mingled with dried shrimps</p>
<p class="line7">the crickets are chirping.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class="pindent">Tiger looked at him hopefully.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Can’t get the hang of that one,” said Bond apologetically.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You do not catch the still-life quality of these verses?
The flash of insight into humanity, into nature? Now, do
me a favour, Bondo-san. Write a <span class="it">haiku</span> for me yourself.
I am sure you could get the hang of it. After all you must
have had <span class="it">some</span> education?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. “Mostly in Latin and Greek. All about
Caesar and Balbus and so on. Absolutely no help in ordering
a cup of coffee in Rome or Athens after I’d left school.
And things like trigonometry, which I’ve totally forgotten.
But give me a pen and a piece of paper and I’ll have
a bash, if you’ll forgive the bad joke.” Tiger handed them
over, and Bond put his head in his hands. Finally, after
much crossing out and rewriting he said, “Tiger, how’s
this? It makes just as much sense as old Basshō and it’s much
more pithy.” He read out:</p>


          <div class="poetry-container">
          <div class="lgp"> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class="lgl">
<p class="line7">“You only live twice:</p>
<p class="line7">Once when you’re born,</p>
<p class="line7">Once when you look death in the face.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class="pindent">Tiger clapped his hands softly. He said with real delight,
“But that is excellent, Bondo-san. Most sincere.” He took
the pen and paper and jotted some Japanese characters up
the page. He shook his head. “No, it won’t do in Japanese.
You have the wrong number of syllables. But it is a most
honourable attempt.” He looked keenly at Bond. “You
were perhaps thinking of your mission?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Perhaps,” said Bond with indifference.</p>

<p class="pindent">“It is weighing on your mind?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“The practical difficulties are bound to do so. I have
swallowed the moral principles involved. Things being as
they are, I have to accept that the end justifies the means.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Then you are not concerned with your own safety?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Not particularly. I’ve had worse jobs to do.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I must congratulate you on your stoicism. You do not
appear to value your life as highly as most Westerners.”
Tiger looked at him kindly. “Is there perhaps a reason for
that?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was offhand. “Not that I can think of. But for
God’s sake chuck it, Tiger! None of your Japanese brainwashing!
More <span class="it">saké</span>, and answer my question of yesterday.
Why weren’t those men disabled by those terrific slashes
to the groin? That might be of some practical value to me
instead of all this waffle about poetry.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger ordered the <span class="it">saké</span>. He laughed. “Unfortunately,
you are too old to benefit. I would need to have caught
you at the age of about fourteen. You see, it is this way.
You know the <span class="it">sumo</span> wrestlers? It is they who invented
the trick many centuries ago. It is vital for them to be
immune from damage to those parts of the body. Now,
you know that, in men, the testicles, which until puberty
have been held inside the body, are released by a particular
muscle and descend between the legs?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, the <span class="it">sumo</span> wrestler will have been selected for his
profession by the time of puberty. Perhaps because of his
weight and strength, or perhaps because he comes of a
<span class="it">sumo</span> family. Well, by assiduously massaging those parts,
he is able, after much practice, to cause the testicles to
re-enter the body up the inguinal canal down which they
originally descended.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“My God, you Japanese!” said Bond with admiration.
“You really are up to all the tricks. You mean he gets
them right out of the way behind the bones of the pelvis
or what not?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Your knowledge of anatomy is as vague as your appreciation
for poetry, but that is more or less so, yes. Then,
before a fight, he will bind up that part of the body most
thoroughly to contain these vulnerable organs in their
hiding-place. Afterwards, in the bath, he will release them
to hang normally. I have seen them do it. It is a great pity
that it is now too late for you to practise this art. It might
have given you more confidence on your mission. It is my
experience that agents fear most for that part of the body
when there is fighting to be done or when they risk capture.
These organs, as you know, are most susceptible to
torture for the extraction of information.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’t I know it!” said Bond from the heart. “Some
of our chaps wear a box when they think they’re in for a
rough-house. I don’t care for them. Too uncomfortable.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What is a box?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It is what our cricketers wear to protect those parts
when they go out to bat. It is a light padded shield of
aluminium.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I regret that we have nothing of that nature. We do
not play cricket in Japan. Only baseball.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Lucky for you you weren’t occupied by the British,”
commented Bond. “Cricket is a much more difficult and
skilful game.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“The Americans say otherwise.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Naturally. They want to sell you baseball equipment.”</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">They arrived at Beppu in the southern island of Kyushu
as the sun was setting. Tiger said that this was just the
time to see the famous geysers and fumaroles of the little
spa. In any case, there would be no time in the morning as
they would have to start early for Fukuoka, their final
destination. Bond shivered slightly at the name. The moment
was rapidly approaching when the <span class="it">saké</span> and sightseeing
would have to stop.</p>

<p class="pindent">Above the town of Beppu, they visited in turn the ten
spectacular “hells,” as they are officially designated. The
stink of sulphur was disgusting, and each bubbling, burping
nest of volcanic fumaroles was more horrific than the
last. The steaming mud and belching geysers were of different
colours—red, blue, and orange—and everywhere there
were warning notices and skulls and crossbones to keep
visitors at a safe distance. The tenth “hell” announced in
English and Japanese that there would be an eruption
punctually every twenty minutes. They joined a small
group of spectators under the arc lights that pinpointed
a small quiescent crater in a rocky area bespattered with
mud. Sure enough, in five minutes, there came a rumbling
from underground and a jet of steaming grey mud shot
twenty feet up into the air and splashed down inside the
enclosure. As Bond was turning away, he noticed a large
red painted wheel, heavily padlocked and surrounded by
wire netting in a small separate enclosure. There were
warning notices above it and a particularly menacing skull
and crossbones. Bond asked Tiger what it was.</p>

<p class="pindent">“It says that this wheel controls the pulse of the geyser.
It says that if this wheel were screwed down it could result
in the destruction of the entire establishment. It gives the
explosive force of the volcano, if the exhaust valve of the
geyser were to be closed, as the equivalent of a thousand
pounds of T.N.T. It is, of course, all a bit of nonsense to
attract the tourists. But now, back to the town, Bondo-san!
Since it is our last day together,” he added hastily, “on this
particular voyage, I have arranged a special treat. I ordered
it by radio from the ship. A <span class="it">fugu</span> feast!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond cursed silently. The memory of his eggs Benedict
the night before was intolerably sweet. What new monstrosity
was this? he asked.</p>

<p class="pindent">“<span class="it">Fugu</span> is the Japanese blow-fish. In the water, it looks
like a brown owl, but when captured it blows itself up into
a ball covered with wounding spines. We sometimes dry
the skins and put candles inside and use them as lanterns.
But the flesh is particularly delicious. It is the staple food
of the <span class="it">sumo</span> wrestlers because it is supposed to be very
strength-giving. The fish is also very popular with suicides
and murderers because its liver and sex glands contain a
poison which brings death instantaneously.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s just what I would have chosen for dinner. How
thoughtful of you, Tiger.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Have no fear, Bondo-san. Because of the dangerous
properties of the fish, every <span class="it">fugu</span> restaurant has to be
manned by experts and be registered with the state.”</p>

<p class="pindent">They left their bags at a Japanese inn where Tiger had
reserved rooms, enjoyed the <span class="it">o-furo</span>, honourable bath, together
in the blue-tiled miniature swimming pool whose
water was very hot and smelled of sulphur, and then,
totally relaxed, went off down the street leading to the
sea.</p>

<p class="pindent">(Bond had become enamoured of the civilized, vaguely
Roman bathing habits of the Japanese. Was it because of
these, because they washed <span class="it">outside</span> the bath instead of wallowing
in their own effluvia, that they all smelled so clean?
Tiger said bluntly that, at the very best, Westerners smelled
of sweet pork.)</p>

<p class="pindent">The restaurant had a giant blow-fish hanging as a sign
above the door, and inside, to Bond’s relief, there were
Western-style chairs and tables at which a smattering of
people were eating with the intense concentration of the
Japanese. They were expected, and their table had been
prepared. Bond said, “Now then, Tiger, I’m not going
to commit honourable suicide without at least five bottles
of <span class="it">saké</span> inside me.” The flasks were brought, all five of
them, to the accompaniment of much tittering by the
waitresses. Bond downed the lot, tumbler by tumbler, and
expressed himself satisfied. “Now you can bring on this
blasted blow-fish,” he said belligerently, “and if it kills
me, it will be doing a good turn to our friend the doctor
in his castle.”</p>

<p class="pindent">A very beautiful white porcelain dish as big as a bicycle
wheel was brought forward with much ceremony. On it
were arranged, in the pattern of a huge flower, petal upon
petal of a very thinly sliced and rather transparent white
fish. Bond followed Tiger’s example and set to with his
chopsticks. He was proud of the fact that he had reached
Black Belt standard with these instruments—the ability
to eat an underdone fried egg with them.</p>

<p class="pindent">The fish tasted of nothing, not even of fish. But it was
very pleasant on the palate and Bond was effusive in his
compliments because Tiger, smacking his lips over each
morsel, obviously expected it of him. There followed various
side-dishes containing other parts of the fish, and more
<span class="it">saké</span>, but this time containing raw <span class="it">fugu</span> fins.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat back and lit a cigarette. He said, “Well, Tiger.
This is nearly the end of my education. Tomorrow you
say I am to leave the nest. How many marks out of a
hundred?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger looked at him quizzically. “You have done well,
Bondo-san. Apart from your inclination to make Western
jokes about Eastern customs. Fortunately I am a man of
infinite patience, and I must admit that your company has
given me much pleasure and a certain amount of amusement.
I will award you seventy-five marks out of a possible
hundred.”</p>

<p class="pindent">As they rose to go, a man brushed past Bond to get to
the exit. He was a stocky man with a white <span class="it">masko</span> over
his mouth, and he wore an ugly leather hat. The man on
the train!</p>

<p class="pindent">Well, well! thought Bond. If he shows up on the last
lap to Fukuoka, I’ll get him. If not, I’ll reluctantly put
it down to “funny-coincidence department.” But it looks
like nought out of a hundred to Tiger for powers of observation.</p>
