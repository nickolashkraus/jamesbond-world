CHAPTER EIGHT
<br class="calibre6"/>
ALL TO PLAY FOR
</h3>

<p class="calibre4">
'Good afternoon, Blacking.  All set?'  The voice was
casual, authoritative.  'I see there's a car outside.
Not somebody looking for a game, I suppose?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I'm not sure, sir.  It's an old member come back to have
a club made up.  Would you like me to ask him, sir?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Who is it?  What's his name?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond smiled grimly.  He pricked his ears.  He wanted to
catch every inflection.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'A Mr Bond, sir.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There was a pause.  'Bond?'  The voice had not changed.
It was politely interested.  'Met a fellow called Bond the
other day.  What's his first name?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'James, sir.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Oh yes.'  Now the pause was longer.  'Does he know I'm
here?'  Bond could sense Goldfinger's antennae probing
the situation.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'He's in the workshop, sir.  May have seen your car
drive up.'  Bond thought: Alfred's never told a lie in his
life.  He's not going to start now.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Might be an idea.'  Now Goldfinger's voice unbent.
He wanted something from Alfred Blacking, some
information.  'What sort of a game does this chap play?  What's his
handicap?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Used to be quite useful when he was a boy, sir.  Haven't
seen his game since then.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Hm.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond could feel the man weighing it all up.  Bond
smelled that the bait was going to be taken.  He reached
into his bag and pulled out his driver and started rubbing
down the grip with a block of shellac.  Might as well look
busy.  A board in the shop creaked.  Bond honed away
industriously, his back to the open door.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I think we've met before.'  The voice from the doorway
was low, neutral.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond looked quickly over his shoulder.  'My God, you
made me jump.  Why—' recognition dawned—'it's
Gold, Goldman ... er—Goldfinger.'  He hoped he wasn't
overplaying it.  He said with a hint of dislike, or mistrust,
'Where have you sprung from?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I told you I played down here.  Remember?'  Goldfinger
was looking at him shrewdly.  Now the eyes opened wide.
The X-ray gaze pierced through to the back of Bond's
skull.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'No.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Did not Miss Masterton give you my message?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'No.  What was it?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I said I would be over here and that I would like a
game of golf with you.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Oh, well,' Bond's voice was coldly polite, 'we must do
that some day.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I was playing with the professional.  I will play with you
instead.'  Goldfinger was stating a fact.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There was no doubt that Goldfinger was hooked.  Now
Bond must play hard to get.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Why not some other time?  I've come to order a club.
Anyway I'm not in practice.  There probably isn't a
caddie.'  Bond was being as rude as he could.  Obviously the
last thing he wanted to do was play with Goldfinger.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I also haven't played for some time.'  (Bloody liar,
thought Bond.)  'Ordering a club will not take a
moment.'  Goldfinger turned back into the shop.  'Blacking,
have you got a caddie for Mr Bond?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes, sir.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Then that is arranged.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond wearily thrust his driver back into his bag.  'Well,
all right then.'  He thought of a final way of putting
Goldfinger off.  He said roughly, 'But I warn you I like playing
for money.  I can't be bothered to knock a ball round just
for the fun of it.'  Bond felt pleased with the character he
was building up for himself.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Was there a glint of triumph, quickly concealed, in
Goldfinger's pale eyes?  He said indifferently, 'That suits
me.  Anything you like.  Off handicap, of course.  I think
you said you're nine.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger said carefully, 'Where, may I ask?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Huntercombe.'  Bond was also nine at Sunningdale.
Huntercombe was an easier course.  Nine at Huntercombe
wouldn't frighten Goldfinger.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'And I also am nine.  Here.  Up on the board.  So it's a
level game.  Right?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond shrugged.  'You'll be too good for me.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I doubt it.  However,' Goldfinger was offhand, 'tell
you what I'll do.  That bit of money you removed from me
in Miami.  Remember?  The big figure was ten.  I like a
gamble.  It will be good for me to have to try.  I will play
you double or quits for that.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said indifferently, 'That's too much.'  Then, as if
he thought better of it, thought he might win, he said—with
just the right amount of craft mixed with reluctance—'Of
course you can say that was "found money".  I
won't miss it if it goes again.  Oh, well, all right.  Easy
come easy go.  Level match.  Ten thousand dollars it is.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger turned away.  He said, and there was a
sudden sweetness in the flat voice, 'That's all arranged
then, Mr Blacking.  Many thanks.  Put your fee down on
my account.  Very sorry we shall be missing our game.
Now, let me pay the caddie fees.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Alfred Blacking came into the workroom and picked up
Bond's clubs.  He looked very directly at Bond.  He said,
'Remember what I told you, sir.'  One eye closed and
opened again.  'I mean about that flat swing of yours.  It
needs watching—all the time.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond smiled at him.  Alfred had long ears.  He might
not have caught the figure, but he knew that somehow this
was to be a key game.  'Thanks, Alfred.  I won't forget.
Four Penfolds—with hearts on them.  And a dozen tees.
I won't be a minute.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond walked through the shop and out to his car.  The
bowler-hatted man was polishing the metal work of the
Rolls with a cloth.  Bond felt rather than saw him stop and
watch Bond take out his zip bag and go into the club
house.  The man had a square flat yellow face.  One of
the Koreans?
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond paid his green-fee to Hampton, the steward, and
went into the changing-room.  It was just the same—the
same tacky smell of old shoes and socks and last summer's
sweat.  Why was it a tradition of the most famous golf clubs
that their standard of hygiene should be that of a Victorian
private school?  Bond changed his socks and put on the
battered old pair of nailed Saxones.  He took off the coat of
his yellowing black and white hound's-tooth suit and
pulled on a faded black wind-cheater.  Cigarettes?
Lighter?  He was ready to go.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond walked slowly out, preparing his mind for the
game.  On purpose he had needled this man into a high,
tough match so that Goldfinger's respect for him should be
increased and Goldfinger's view of Bond—that he was the
type of ruthless, hard adventurer who might be very useful
to Goldfinger—would be confirmed.  Bond had thought
that perhaps a hundred-pound Nassau would be the
form.  But ten thousand dollars!  There had probably never
been such a high singles game in history—except in the
finals of American Championships or in the big amateur
Calcutta Sweeps where it was the backers rather than the
players who had the money on.  Goldfinger's private
accounting must have taken a nasty dent.  He wouldn't
have liked that.  He would be aching to get some of his
money back.  When Bond had talked about playing high,
Goldfinger had seen his chance.  So be it.  But one thing
was certain, for a hundred reasons Bond could not afford
to lose.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
He turned into the shop and picked up the balls and
tees from Alfred Blacking.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Hawker's got the clubs, sir.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond strolled out across the five hundred yards of
shaven seaside turf that led to the first tee.  Goldfinger was
practising on the putting green.  His caddie stood near by,
rolling balls to him.  Goldfinger putted in the new
fashion—between his legs with a mallet putter.  Bond felt
encouraged.  He didn't believe in the system.  He knew it was
no good practising himself.  His old hickory Calamity
Jane had its good days and its bad.  There was nothing to
do about it.  He knew also that the St Marks practice green
bore no resemblance, in speed or texture, to the greens on
the course.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond caught up with the limping, insouciant figure of
his caddie who was sauntering along chipping at an
imaginary ball with Bond's blaster.  'Afternoon, Hawker.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Afternoon, sir.'  Hawker handed Bond the blaster and
threw down three used balls.  His keen sardonic poacher's
face split in a wry grin of welcome.  'How've you been
keepin', sir?  Played any golf in the last twenty years?  Can
you still put them on the roof of the starter's hut?'  This
referred to the day when Bond, trying to do just that
before a match, had put two balls through the starter's
window.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Let's see.'  Bond took the blaster and hefted it in his
hand, gauging the distance.  The tap of the balls on the
practice green had ceased.  Bond addressed the ball,
swung quickly, lifted his head and shanked the ball almost
at right angles.  He tried again.  This time it was a dunch.
A foot of turf flew up.  The ball went ten yards.  Bond
turned to Hawker, who was looking his most sardonic.
'It's all right, Hawker.  Those were for show.  Now then,
one for you.'  He stepped up to the third ball, took his club
back slowly and whipped the club head through.  The ball
soared a hundred feet, paused elegantly, dropped eighty
feet on to the thatched roof of the starter's hut and
bounced down.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond handed back the club.  Hawker's eyes were
thoughtful, amused.  He said nothing.  He pulled out the
driver and handed it to Bond.  They walked together to the
first tee, talking about Hawker's family.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger joined them, relaxed, impassive.  Bond
greeted Goldfinger's caddie, an obsequious, talkative man
called Foulks whom Bond had never liked.  Bond glanced
at Goldfinger's clubs.  They were a brand new set of
American Ben Hogans with smart St Marks leather covers
for the woods.  The bag was one of the stitched black
leather holdalls favoured by American pros.  The clubs
were in individual cardboard tubes for easy extraction.
It was a pretentious outfit, but the best.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Toss for honour?'  Goldfinger flicked a coin.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Tails.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
It was heads.  Goldfinger took out his driver and
unpeeled a new ball.  He said, 'Dunlop 65.  Number One.
Always use the same ball.  What's yours?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Penfold.  Hearts.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger looked keenly at Bond.  'Strict Rules of Golf?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Naturally.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Right.'  Goldfinger walked on to the tee and teed up.  He
took one or two careful, concentrated practice swings.
It was a type of swing Bond knew well—the grooved,
mechanical, repeating swing of someone who had studied
the game with great care, read all the books and spent
five thousand pounds on the finest pro teachers.  It would
be a good, scoring swing which might not collapse under
pressure.  Bond envied it.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger took up his stance, waggled gracefully, took
his club head back in a wide slow arc and, with his eyes
glued to the ball, broke his wrists correctly.  He brought
the club head mechanically, effortlessly, down and
through the ball and into a rather artificial, copybook
finish.  The ball went straight and true about two hundred
yards down the fairway.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
It was an excellent, uninspiring shot.  Bond knew that
Goldfinger would be capable of repeating the same swing
with different clubs again and again round the eighteen
holes.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond took his place, gave himself a lowish tee, addressed
the ball with careful enmity and, with a flat, racket-player's
swing in which there was just too much wrist for safety,
lashed the ball away.  It was a fine, attacking drive that
landed past Goldfinger's ball and rolled on fifty yards.
But it had had a shade of draw and ended on the edge of
the left-hand rough.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
They were two good drives.  As Bond handed his club
to Hawker and strolled off in the wake of the more
impatient Goldfinger, he smelled the sweet smell of the
beginning of a knock-down-and-drag-out game of golf on
a beautiful day in May with the larks singing over the
greatest seaside course in the world.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The first hole of the Royal St Marks is four hundred and
fifty yards long—four hundred and fifty yards of
undulating fairway with one central bunker to trap a mis-hit
second shot and a chain of bunkers guarding three-quarters
of the green to trap a well-hit one.  You can slip
through the unguarded quarter, but the fairway slopes
to the right there and you are more likely to end up with
a nasty first-chip-of-the-day out of the rough.  Goldfinger
was well placed to try for this opening.  Bond watched him
take what was probably a spoon, make his two practice
swings and address the ball.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Many unlikely people play golf, including people who
are blind, who have only one arm, or even no legs, and
people often wear bizarre clothes to the game.  Other
golfers don't think them odd, for there are no rules of
appearance or dress at golf.  That is one of its minor
pleasures.  But Goldfinger had made an attempt to look
smart at golf and that is the only way of dressing that is
incongruous on a links.  Everything matched in a blaze of
rust-coloured tweed from the buttoned 'golfer's cap'
centred on the huge, flaming red hair, to the brilliantly
polished, almost orange shoes.  The plus-four suit was too
well cut and the plus-fours themselves had been pressed
down the sides.  The stockings were of a matching heather
mixture and had green garter tabs.  It was as if Goldfinger
had gone to his tailor and said, 'Dress me for golf—you
know, like they wear in Scotland.'  Social errors made no
impression on Bond, and for the matter of that he rarely
noticed them.  With Goldfinger it was different.  Everything
about the man had grated on Bond's teeth from the
first moment he had seen him.  The assertive blatancy of his
clothes was just part of the malevolent animal magnetism
that had affected Bond from the beginning.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger executed his mechanical, faultless swing.
The ball flew true but just failed to make the slope and
curled off to the right to finish pin high off the green in
the short rough.  Easy five.  A good chip could turn it into
a four, but it would have to be a good one.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond walked over to his ball.  It was lying cocked up,
just off the fairway.  Bond took his number four wood.  Now
for the 'all air route'—a soaring shot that would carry
the cross-bunkers and give him two putts for a four.  Bond
remembered the dictum of the pros: 'It's never too early
to start winning.'  He took it easy, determined not to press
for the long but comfortable carry.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
As soon as Bond had hit the shot he knew it wouldn't
do.  The difference between a good golf shot and a bad
one is the same as the difference between a beautiful and
a plain woman—a matter of millimetres.  In this case, the
club face had gone through just that one millimetre too
low under the ball.  The arc of flight was high and
soft—no legs.  Why the hell hadn't he taken a spoon or a two
iron off that lie?  The ball hit the lip of the far bunker and
fell back.  Now it was the blaster, and fighting for a half.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond never worried too long about his bad or stupid
shots.  He put them behind him and thought of the next.
He came up with the bunker, took his blaster and
measured the distance to the pin.  Twenty yards.  The ball was
lying well back.  Should he splash it out with a wide stance
and an outside-in swing, or should he blast it and take
plenty of sand?  For safety's sake he would blast it out.
Bond went down into the bunker.  Head down and follow
well through.  The easiest shot in golf.  Try and put it dead.
The wish, half way down his back swing, hurried the
hands in front of the club head.  The loft was killed and
there was the ball rolling back off the face.  Get it out, you
bloody fool, and hole a long putt!  Now Bond took too much
sand.  He was out, but barely on the green.  Goldfinger
bent to his chip and kept his head down until the ball was
half way to the hole.  The ball stopped three inches from
the pin.  Without waiting to be given the putt, Goldfinger
turned his back on Bond and walked off towards the
second tee.  Bond picked up his ball and took his driver
from Hawker.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'What does he say his handicap is, sir?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Nine.  It's a level match.  Have to do better than that
though.  Ought to have taken my spoon for the second.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Hawker said encouragingly, 'It's early days yet, sir.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond knew it wasn't.  It was always too early to start
losing.

<h3 class="calibre8">
CHAPTER NINE
<br class="calibre6"/>
THE CUP AND THE LIP
</h3>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger had already teed up.  Bond walked
slowly behind him, followed by Hawker.  Bond stood
and leant on his driver.  He said, 'I thought you
said we would be playing the strict rules of golf.  But I'll
give you that putt.  That makes you one up.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger nodded curtly.  He went through his practice
routine and hit his usual excellent, safe drive.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The second hole is a three hundred and seventy yard
dog-leg to the left with deep cross-bunkers daring you to
take the tiger's line.  But there was a light helping breeze.
For Goldfinger it would now be a five iron for his second.
Bond decided to try and make it easier for himself and
only have a wedge for the green.  He laid his ears back and
hit the ball hard and straight for the bunkers.  The breeze
got under the slight draw and winged the ball on and over.
The ball pitched and disappeared down into the gully
just short of the green.  A four.  Chance of a three.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger strode off without comment.  Bond lengthened
his stride and caught up.  'How's the agoraphobia?
Doesn't all this wide open space bother it?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'No.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger deviated to the right.  He glanced at the
distant, half-hidden flag, planning his second shot.  He
took his five iron and hit a good, careful shot which took a
bad kick short of the green and ran down into the thick
grass to the left.  Bond knew that territory.  Goldfinger
would be lucky to get down in two.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond walked up to his ball, took the wedge and flicked
the ball on to the green with plenty of stop.  The ball
pulled up and lay a yard past the hole.  Goldfinger
executed a creditable pitch but missed the twelve-foot
putt.  Bond had two for the hole from a yard.  He didn't
wait to be given the hole but walked up and putted.  The
ball stopped an inch short.  Goldfinger walked off the
green.  Bond knocked the ball in.  All square.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The third is a blind two hundred and forty yards, all
carry, a difficult three.  Bond chose his brassie and hit a
good one.  It would be on or near the green.  Goldfinger's
routine drive was well hit but would probably not have
enough steam to carry the last of the rough and trickle
down into the saucer of the green.  Sure enough,
Goldfinger's ball was on top of the protecting mound of rough.
He had a nasty, cuppy lie, with a tuft just behind the ball.
Goldfinger stood and looked at the lie.  He seemed to make
up his mind.  He stepped past his ball to take a club from
the caddie.  His left foot came down just behind the ball,
flattening the tuft.  Goldfinger could now take his putter.
He did so and trickled the ball down the bank towards the
hole.  It stopped three feet short.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond frowned.  The only remedy against a cheat at golf
is not to play with him again.  But that was no good in this
match.  Bond had no intention of playing with the man
again.  And it was no good starting a you-did-I-didn't
argument unless he caught Goldfinger doing something
even more outrageous.  Bond would just have to try and
beat him, cheating and all.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Now Bond's twenty-foot putt was no joke.  There was
no question of going for the hole.  He would have to
concentrate on laying it dead.  As usual, when one plays to
go dead, the ball stopped short—a good yard short.  Bond
took a lot of trouble about the putt and holed it, sweating.
He knocked Goldfinger's ball away.  He would go on
giving Goldfinger missable putts until suddenly Bond
would ask him to hole one.  Then that one might look just
a bit more difficult.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Still all square.  The fourth is four hundred and sixty
yards.  You drive over one of the tallest and deepest bunkers
in the United Kingdom and then have a long second shot
across an undulating hilly fairway to a plateau green
guarded by a final steep slope which makes it easier to take
three putts than two.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond picked up his usual fifty yards on the drive and
Goldfinger hit two of his respectable shots to the gully
below the green.  Bond, determined to get up, took a
brassie instead of a spoon and went over the green and
almost up against the boundary fence.  From there he was
glad to get down in three for a half.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The fifth was again a long carry, followed by Bond's
favourite second shot on the course—over bunkers and
through a valley between high sand-dunes to a distant,
taunting flag.  It is a testing hole for which the first essential
is a well-placed drive.  Bond stood on the tee, perched high
up in the sand-hills, and paused before the shot while he
gazed at the glittering distant sea and at the faraway
crescent of white cliffs beyond Pegwell Bay.  Then he took
up his stance and visualized the tennis court of turf that
was his target.  He took the club back as slowly as he knew
how and started down for the last terrific acceleration
before the club head met the ball.  There was a dull clang
on his right.  It was too late to stop.  Desperately Bond
focused the ball and tried to keep his swing all in one piece.
There came the ugly clonk of a mis-hit ball.  Bond's head
shot up.  It was a lofted hook.  Would it have the legs?  Get
on!  Get on!  The ball hit the top of a mountain of rough
and bounced over.  Would it reach the beginning of the
fairway?
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond turned towards Goldfinger and the caddies, his
eyes fierce.  Goldfinger was straightening up.  He met
Bond's eyes indifferently.  'Sorry.  Dropped my driver.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Don't do it again,' said Bond curtly.  He stood down off
the tee and handed his driver to Hawker.  Hawker shook
his head sympathetically.  Bond took out a cigarette and
lit it.  Goldfinger hit his drive the dead straight regulation
two hundred yards.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
They walked down the hill in a silence which Goldfinger
unexpectedly broke.  'What is the firm you work for?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Universal Export.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'And where do they hang out?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'London.  Regent's Park.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'What do they export?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond woke up from his angry ruminations.  Here, pay
attention!  This is work, not a game.  All right, he put you
off your drive, but you've got your cover to think about.
Don't let him needle you into making mistakes about it.
Build up your story.  Bond said casually, 'Oh everything
from sewing-machines to tanks.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'What's your speciality?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond could feel Goldfinger's eyes on him.  He said, 'I
look after the small arms side.  Spend most of my time
selling miscellaneous ironmongery to sheiks and
rajahs—anyone the Foreign Office decides doesn't want the stuff
to shoot at us with.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Interesting work.'  Goldfinger's voice was flat, bored.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Not very.  I'm thinking of quitting.  Came down here
for a week's holiday to think it out.  Not much future in
England.  Rather like the idea of Canada.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Indeed?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
They were past the rough and Bond was relieved to find
that his ball had got a forward kick off the hill on to the
fairway.  The fairway curved slightly to the left and Bond
had even managed to pick up a few feet on Goldfinger.
It was Goldfinger to play.  Goldfinger took out his spoon.
He wasn't going for the green but only to get over the
bunkers and through the valley.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond waited for the usual safe shot.  He looked at his
own lie.  Yes, he could take his brassie.  There came the
wooden thud of a mis-hit.  Goldfinger's ball, hit off the
heel, sped along the ground and into the stony wastes of
Hell Bunker—the widest bunker and the only unkempt
one, because of the pebbles, on the course.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
For once Homer had nodded—or rather, lifted his
head.  Perhaps his mind had been half on what Bond had
told him.  Good show!  But Goldfinger might still get down
in three more.  Bond took out his brassie.  He couldn't
afford to play safe.  He addressed the ball, seeing in his
mind's eye its eighty-eight-millimetre trajectory through
the valley and then the two or three bounces that would
take it on to the green.  He laid off a bit to the right to
allow for his draw.  Now!
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There came a soft clinking away to his right.  Bond stood
away from his ball.  Goldfinger had his back to Bond.  He
was gazing out to sea, rapt in its contemplation, while his
right hand played 'unconsciously' with the money in his
pocket.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond smiled grimly.  He said, 'Could you stop shifting
bullion till after my shot?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger didn't turn round or answer.  The noise
stopped.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond turned back to his shot, desperately trying to
clear his mind again.  Now the brassie was too much of a
risk.  It needed too good a shot.  He handed it to Hawker
and took his spoon and banged the ball safely through the
valley.  It ran on well and stopped on the apron.  A five,
perhaps a four.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger got well out of the bunker and put his chip
dead.  Bond putted too hard and missed the one back.
Still all square.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The sixth, appropriately called 'The Virgin', is a
famous short hole in the world of golf.  A narrow green,
almost ringed with bunkers, it can need anything from an
eight to a two iron according to the wind.  Today, for
Bond, it was a seven.  He played a soaring shot, laid off to
the right for the wind to bring it in.  It ended twenty feet
beyond the pin with a difficult putt over and down a
shoulder.  Should be a three.  Goldfinger took his five and
played it straight.  The breeze took it and it rolled into the
deep bunker on the left.  Good news!  That would be the
hell of a difficult three.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
They walked in silence to the green.  Bond glanced into
the bunker.  Goldfinger's ball was in a deep heel-mark.
Bond walked over to his ball and listened to the larks.
This was going to put him one up.  He looked for Hawker
to take his putter, but Hawker was the other side of the
green, watching with intent concentration Goldfinger play
his shot.  Goldfinger got down into the bunker with his
blaster.  He jumped up to get a view of the hole and then
settled himself for the shot.  As his club went up Bond's
heart lifted.  He was going to try and flick it out—a
hopeless technique from that buried lie.  The only hope
would have been to explode it.  Down came the club,
smoothly, without hurry.  With hardly a handful of sand
the ball curved up out of the deep bunker, bounced once
and lay dead!
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond swallowed.  Blast his eyes!  How the hell had
Goldfinger managed that?  Now, out of sour grapes, Bond must
try for his two.  He went for it, missed the hole by an inch
and rolled a good yard past.  Hell and damnation!  Bond
walked slowly up to the putt, knocking Goldfinger's ball
away.  Come on, you bloody fool!  But the spectre of the
big swing—from an almost certain one up to a possible
one down—made Bond wish the ball into the hole instead
of tapping it in.  The coaxed ball, lacking decision, slid
past the lip.  One down!
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Now Bond was angry with himself.  He, and he alone,
had lost that hole.  He had taken three putts from twenty
feet.  He really must pull himself together and get going.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
At the seventh, five hundred yards, they both hit good
drives and Goldfinger's immaculate second lay fifty yards
short of the green.  Bond took his brassie.  Now for the
equalizer!  But he hit from the top, his club head came
down too far ahead of the hands and the smothered ball
shot into one of the right-hand bunkers.  Not a good lie,
but he must put it on the green.  Bond took a dangerous
seven and failed to get it out.  Goldfinger got his five.  Two
down.  They halved the short eighth in three.  At the ninth,
Bond, determined to turn only one down, again tried to do
too much off a poor lie.  Goldfinger got his four to Bond's
five.  Three down at the turn!  Not too good.  Bond asked
Hawker for a new ball.  Hawker unwrapped it slowly,
waiting for Goldfinger to walk over the hillock to the next
tee.  Hawker said softly, 'You saw what he did at The
Virgin, sir?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes, damn him.  It was an amazing shot.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Hawker was surprised.  'Oh, you didn't see what he did
in the bunker, sir?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'No, what?  I was too far away.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The other two were out of sight over the rise.  Hawker
silently walked down into one of the bunkers guarding the
ninth green, kicked a hole with his toe and dropped the
ball in the hole.  He then stood just behind the half-buried
ball with his feet close together.  He looked up at Bond.
'Remember he jumped up to look at the line to the
hole, sir?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Just watch this, sir.'  Hawker looked towards the ninth
pin and jumped, just as Goldfinger had done, as if to get
the line.  Then he looked up at Bond again and pointed
to the ball at his feet.  The heavy impact of the two feet
just behind the ball had levelled the hole in which it had
lain and had squeezed the ball out so that it was now
perfectly teed for an easy shot—for just the easy cut-up
shot which had seemed utterly impossible from
Goldfinger's lie at The Virgin.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond looked at his caddie for a moment in silence.
Then he said, 'Thanks, Hawker.  Give me the bat and the
ball.  Somebody's going to be second in this match, and
I'm damned if it's going to be me.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes, sir,' said Hawker stolidly.  He limped off on the
short cut that would take him half way down the tenth
fairway.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond sauntered slowly over the rise and down to the
tenth tee.  He hardly looked at Goldfinger who was standing
on the tee swishing his driver impatiently.  Bond was
clearing his mind of everything but cold, offensive resolve.
For the first time since the first tee, he felt supremely
confident.  All he needed was a sign from heaven and his game
would catch fire.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The tenth at the Royal St Marks is the most dangerous
hole on the course.  The second shot, to the skiddy plateau
green with cavernous bunkers to right and left and a steep
hill beyond, has broken many hearts.  Bond remembered
that Philip Scrutton, out in four under fours in the Gold
Bowl, had taken a fourteen at this hole, seven of them
ping-pong shots from one bunker to another, to and fro
across the green.  Bond knew that Goldfinger would play
his second to the apron, or short of it, and be glad to get a
five.  Bond must go for it and get his four.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Two good drives and, sure enough, Goldfinger well up
on the apron with his second.  A possible four.  Bond took
his seven, laid off plenty for the breeze and fired the ball
off into the sky.  At first he thought he had laid off too
much, but then the ball began to float to the left.  It
pitched and stopped dead in the soft sand blown on to the
green from the right-hand bunker.  A nasty fifteen-foot
putt.  Bond would now be glad to get a half.  Sure enough,
Goldfinger putted up to within a yard.  That, thought
Bond as he squared up to his putt, he will have to hole.
He hit his own putt fairly smartly to get it through the
powdering of sand and was horrified to see it going like
lightning across the skiddy green.  God, he was going to
have not a yard, but a two-yard putt back!  But suddenly,
as if drawn by a magnet, the ball swerved straight for the
hole, hit the back of the tin, bounced up and fell into the
cup with an audible rattle.  The sign from heaven!  Bond went
up to Hawker, winked at him and took his driver.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
They left the caddies and walked down the slope and
back to the next tee.  Goldfinger said coldly, 'That putt
ought to have run off the green.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said off-handedly, 'Always give the hole a chance!'  He
teed up his ball and hit his best drive of the day down
the breeze.  Wedge and one putt?  Goldfinger hit his
regulation shot and they walked off again.  Bond said, 'By the
way, what happened to that nice Miss Masterton?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger looked straight in front of him.  'She left my
employ.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond thought, good for her!  He said, 'Oh, I must get in
touch with her again.  Where did she go to?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I couldn't say.'  Goldfinger walked away from Bond
towards his ball.  Bond's drive was out of sight, over the
ridge that bisected the fairway.  It wouldn't be more than
fifty yards from the pin.  Bond thought he knew what would
be in Goldfinger's mind, what is in most golfers' minds
when they smell the first scent of a good lead melting away.
Bond wouldn't be surprised to see that grooved swing
quicken a trifle.  It did.  Goldfinger hooked into a bunker
on the left of the green.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Now was the moment when it would be the end of the
game if Bond made a mistake, let his man off the hook.  He
had a slightly downhill lie, otherwise an easy chip—but to
the trickiest green on the course.  Bond played it like a
man.  The ball ended six feet from the pin.  Goldfinger
played well out of his bunker, but missed the longish putt.
Now Bond was only one down.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
They halved the dog-leg twelfth in inglorious fives and
the longish thirteenth also in fives, Goldfinger having to
hole a good putt to do so.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Now a tiny cleft of concentration had appeared on
Goldfinger's massive, unlined forehead.  He took a drink of
water from the tap beside the fourteenth tee.  Bond waited
for him.  He didn't want a sharp clang from that tin cup
when it was out-of-bounds over the fence to the right and
the drive into the breeze favouring a slice!  Bond brought
his left hand over to increase his draw and slowed down
his swing.  The drive, well to the left, was only just
adequate, but at least it had stayed in bounds.  Goldfinger,
apparently unmoved by the out-of-bounds hazard, hit his
standard shot.  They both negotiated the transverse canal
without damage and it was another half in five.  Still one
down and now only four to play.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The four hundred and sixty yards fifteenth is perhaps the
only hole where the long hitter may hope to gain one clear
shot.  Two smashing woods will just get you over the line of
bunkers that lie right up against the green.  Goldfinger
had to play short of them with his second.  He could
hardly improve on a five and it was up to Bond to hit a
really godlike second shot from a barely adequate drive.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The sun was on its way down and the shadows of the
four men were beginning to lengthen.  Bond had taken up
his stance.  It was a good lie.  He had kept his driver.  There
was dead silence as he gave his two incisive waggles.  This
was going to be a vital stroke.  Remember to pause at
the top of the swing, come down slow and whip the club
head through at the last second.  Bond began to take the
club back.  Something moved at the corner of his right eye.
From nowhere the shadow of Goldfinger's huge head
approached the ball on the ground, engulfed it and moved
on.  Bond let his swing take itself to pieces in sections.
Then he stood away from his ball and looked up.  Goldfinger's
feet were still moving.  He was looking carefully up
at the sky.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Shades please, Goldfinger.'  Bond's voice was furiously
controlled.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger stopped and looked slowly at Bond.  The
eyebrows were raised a fraction in inquiry.  He moved
back and stood still, saying nothing.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond went back to his ball.  Now then, relax!  To hell
with Goldfinger.  Slam that ball on to the green.  Just stand
still and hit it.  There was a moment when the world stood
still, then ... then somehow Bond did hit it—on a low
trajectory that mounted gracefully to carry the distant
surf of the bunkers.  The ball hit the bank below the green,
bounced high with the impact and rolled out of sight into
the saucer round the pin.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Hawker came up and took the driver out of Bond's
hand.  They walked on together.  Hawker said seriously,
'That's one of the finest shots I've seen in thirty years.'  He
lowered his voice.  'I thought he'd fixed you then, sir.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'He damned nearly did, Hawker.  It was Alfred Blacking
that hit that ball, not me.'  Bond took out his cigarettes,
gave one to Hawker and lit his own.  He said quietly, 'All
square and three to play.  We've got to watch those next
three holes.  Know what I mean?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Don't you worry, sir.  I'll keep my eye on him.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
They came up with the green.  Goldfinger had pitched
on and had a long putt for a four, but Bond's ball was only
two inches away from the hole.  Goldfinger picked up his
ball and walked off the green.  They halved the short
sixteenth in good threes.  Now there were the two long
holes home.  Fours would win them.  Bond hit a fine drive
down the centre.  Goldfinger pushed his far out to the
right into deep rough.  Bond walked along trying not to be
too jubilant, trying not to count his chickens.  A win for
him at this hole and he would only need a half at the
eighteenth for the match.  He prayed that Goldfinger's ball
would be unplayable or, better still, lost.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Hawker had gone on ahead.  He had already laid down
his bag and was busily—far too busily to Bond's way of
thinking—searching for Goldfinger's ball when they
came up.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
It was bad stuff—jungle country, deep thick luxuriant
grass whose roots still held last night's dew.  Unless they
were very lucky, they couldn't hope to find the ball.  After
a few minutes' search Goldfinger and his caddie drifted
away still wider to where the rough thinned out into
isolated tufts.  That's good, thought Bond.  That wasn't
anything like the line.  Suddenly he trod on something.
Hell and damnation.  Should he stamp it in?  He shrugged
his shoulders, bent down and gently uncovered the ball so
as not to improve the lie.  Yes it was a Dunlop 65.  'Here
you are,' he called grudgingly.  'Oh no, sorry.  You play
with a Number One, don't you?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes,' came back Goldfinger's voice impatiently.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Well, this is a Number Seven.'  Bond picked it up and
walked over to Goldfinger.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger gave the ball a cursory glance.  He said, 'Not
mine,' and went on poking among the tufts with the head
of his driver.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
It was a good ball, unmarked and almost new.  Bond
put it in his pocket and went back to his search.  He glanced
at his watch.  The statutory five minutes was almost up.
Another half-minute and by God he was going to claim
the hole.  Strict rules of golf, Goldfinger had stipulated.  All
right my friend, you shall have them!
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger was casting back towards Bond, diligently
prodding and shuffling through the grass.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said, 'Nearly time, I'm afraid.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger grunted.  He started to say something when
there came a cry from his caddie, 'Here you are, sir.
Number One Dunlop.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond followed Goldfinger over to where the caddie stood
on a small plateau of higher ground.  He was pointing
down.  Bond bent and inspected the ball.  Yes, an almost
new Dunlop One and in an astonishingly good lie.  It was
miraculous—more than miraculous.  Bond stared hard
from Goldfinger to his caddie.  'Must have had the hell of
a lucky kick,' he said mildly.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The caddie shrugged his shoulders.  Goldfinger's eyes
were calm, untroubled.  'So it would seem.'  He turned to
his caddie.  'I think we can get a spoon to that one, Foulks.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond walked thoughtfully away and then turned to
watch the shot.  It was one of Goldfinger's best.  It soared
over a far shoulder of rough towards the green.  Might
just have caught the bunker on the right.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond walked on to where Hawker, a long blade of grass
dangling from his wry lips, was standing on the fairway
watching the shot finish.  Bond smiled bitterly at him.  He
said in a controlled voice, 'Is my good friend in the
bunker, or is the bastard on the green?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Green, sir,' said Hawker unemotionally.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond went up to his ball.  Now things had got tough
again.  Once more he was fighting for a half after having a
certain win in his pocket.  He glanced towards the pin,
gauging the distance.  This was a tricky one.  He said,
'Five or six?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'The six should do it, sir.  Nice firm shot.'  Hawker
handed him the club.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Now then, clear your mind.  Keep it slow and deliberate.
It's an easy shot.  Just punch it so that it's got plenty of zip
to get up the bank and on to the green.  Stand still and
head down.  Click!  The ball, hit with a slightly closed face,
went off on just the medium trajectory Bond had wanted.
It pitched below the bank.  It was perfect!  No, damn it.  It
had hit the bank with its second bounce, stopped dead,
hesitated and then rolled back and down again.  Hell's
bells!  Was it Hagen who had said, 'You drive for show, but
you putt for dough'?  Getting dead from below that bank
was one of the most difficult putts on the course.  Bond
reached for his cigarettes and lit one, already preparing
his mind for the next crucial shot to save the hole—so
long as that bastard Goldfinger didn't hole his from
thirty feet!
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Hawker walked along by his side.  Bond said, 'Miracle
finding that ball.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'It wasn't his ball, sir.'  Hawker was stating a fact.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'What do you mean?'  Bond's voice was tense.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Money passed, sir.  White, probably a fiver.  Foulks
must have dropped that ball down his trouser leg.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Hawker!'  Bond stopped in his tracks.  He looked round.
Goldfinger and his caddie were fifty yards away, walking
slowly towards the green.  Bond said fiercely, 'Do you
swear to that?  How can you be sure?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Hawker gave a half-ashamed, lop-sided grin.  But there
was a crafty belligerence in his eye.  'Because his ball was
lying under my bag of clubs, sir.'  When he saw Bond's
open-mouthed expression he added apologetically, 'Sorry,
sir.  Had to do it after what he's been doing to you.
Wouldn't have mentioned it, but I had to let you know
he's fixed you again.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond had to laugh.  He said admiringly, 'Well, you are a
card, Hawker.  So you were going to win the match for me
all on your own!'  He added bitterly, 'But, by God, that
man's the flaming limit.  I've got to get him.  I've simply
got to.  Now let's think!'  They walked slowly on.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond's left hand was in his trousers pocket,
absent-mindedly fingering the ball he had picked up in the
rough.  Suddenly the message went to his brain.  Got it!
He came close to Hawker.  He glanced across at the others.
Goldfinger had stopped.  His back was to Bond and he
was taking the putter out of his bag.  Bond nudged Hawker.
'Here, take this.'  He slipped the ball into the gnarled
hand.  Bond said softly, urgently, 'Be certain you take the
flag.  When you pick up the balls from the green, whichever
way the hole has gone, give Goldfinger this one.  Right?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Hawker walked stolidly forward.  His face was expressionless.
'Got it, sir,' he said in his normal voice.  'Will you
take the putter for this one?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes.'  Bond walked up to his ball.  'Give me a line,
would you?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Hawker walked up on to the green.  He stood sideways
to the line of the putt and then stalked round to behind the
flag and crouched.  He got up.  'Inch outside the right lip,
sir.  Firm putt.  Flag, sir?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'No.  Leave it in, would you.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Hawker stood away.  Goldfinger was standing by his ball
on the right of the green.  His caddie had stopped at the
bottom of the slope.  Bond bent to the putt.  Come on,
Calamity Jane!  This one has got to go dead or I'll put
you across my knee.  Stand still.  Club head straight back
on the line and follow through towards the hole.  Give it a
chance.  Now!  The ball, hit firmly in the middle of the
club, had run up the bank and was on its way to the hole.
But too hard, damn it!  Hit the stick!  Obediently the ball
curved in, rapped the stick hard and bounced back three
inches—dead as a doornail!
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond let out a deep sigh and picked up his discarded
cigarette.  He looked over at Goldfinger.  Now then, you
bastard.  Sweat that one out.  And by God if you hole it!
But Goldfinger couldn't afford to try.  He stopped two feet
short.  'All right, all right,' said Bond generously.  'All
square and one to go.'  It was vital that Hawker should
pick up the balls.  If he had made Goldfinger hole the
short putt it would have been Goldfinger who would have
picked the ball out of the hole.  Anyway, Bond didn't want
Goldfinger to miss that putt.  That wasn't part of the plan.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Hawker bent down and picked up the balls.  He rolled
one towards Bond and handed the other to Goldfinger.
They walked off the green, Goldfinger leading as usual.
Bond noticed Hawker's hand go to his pocket.  Now, so long
as Goldfinger didn't notice anything on the tee!
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
But, with all square and one to go, you don't scrutinize
your ball.  Your motions are more or less automatic.  You
are thinking of how to place your drive, of whether to go
for the green with the second or play to the apron, of the
strength of the wind—of the vital figure four that must
somehow be achieved to win or at least to halve.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Considering that Bond could hardly wait for Goldfinger
to follow him and hit, just once, that treacherous Dunlop
Number Seven that looked so very like a Number One,
Bond's own drive down the four hundred and fifty yard
eighteenth was praiseworthy.  If he wanted to, he could now
reach the green—if he wanted to!
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Now Goldfinger was on the tee.  Now he had bent down.
The ball was on the peg, its lying face turned up at him.
But Goldfinger had straightened, had stood back, was
taking his two deliberate practice swings.  He stepped up
to the ball, cautiously, deliberately.  Stood over it, waggled,
focusing the ball minutely.  Surely he would see!  Surely he
would stop and bend down at the last minute to inspect the
ball!  Would the waggle never end?  But now the club head
was going back, coming down, the left knee bent correctly
in towards the ball, the left arm straight as a ramrod.
Crack!  The ball sailed off, a beautiful drive, as good as
Goldfinger had hit, straight down the fairway.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond's heart sang.  Got you, you bastard!  Got you!
Blithely Bond stepped down from the tee and strolled off
down the fairway planning the next steps which could now
be as eccentric, as fiendish as he wished.  Goldfinger was
beaten already—hoist with his own petard!  Now to roast
him, slowly, exquisitely.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond had no compunction.  Goldfinger had cheated him
twice and got away with it.  But for his cheats at the Virgin
and the seventeenth, not to mention his improved lie at
the third and the various times he had tried to put Bond
off, Goldfinger would have been beaten by now.  If it
needed one cheat by Bond to rectify the score-sheet that
was only poetic justice.  And besides, there was more to
this than a game of golf.  It was Bond's duty to win.  By
his reading of Goldfinger he <i class="calibre3">had</i> to win.  If he was beaten,
the score between the two men would have been equalized.
If he won the match, as he now had, he would be two
up on Goldfinger—an intolerable state of affairs, Bond
guessed, to a man who saw himself as all powerful.  This
man Bond, Goldfinger would say to himself, <i class="calibre3">has</i> something.
He has qualities I can use.  He is a tough adventurer with
plenty of tricks up his sleeve.  This is the sort of man I need
for—for what?  Bond didn't know.  Perhaps there would
be nothing for him.  Perhaps his reading of Goldfinger was
wrong, but there was certainly no other way of creeping
up on the man.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger cautiously took out his spoon for the longish
second over cross-bunkers to the narrow entrance to the
green.  He made one more practice swing than usual and
then hit exactly the right, controlled shot up to the apron.  A
certain five, probably a four.  Much good would it do him!
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond, after a great show of taking pains, brought his
hands down well ahead of the club and smothered his
number three iron so that the topped ball barely scrambled
over the cross-bunkers.  He then wedged the ball on to the
green twenty feet past the pin.  He was where he wanted
to be—enough of a threat to make Goldfinger savour the
sweet smell of victory, enough to make Goldfinger really
sweat to get his four.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
And now Goldfinger really was sweating.  There was a
savage grin of concentration and greed as he bent to the
long putt up the bank and down to the hole.  Not too
hard, not too soft.  Bond could read every anxious thought
that would be running through the man's mind.  Goldfinger
straightened up again, walked deliberately across
the green to behind the flag to verify his line.  He walked
slowly back beside his line, brushing away—carefully,
with the back of his hand—a wisp or two of grass, a
speck of top-dressing.  He bent again and made one or two
practice swings and then stood to the putt, the veins
standing out on his temples, the cleft of concentration deep
between his eyes.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger hit the putt and followed through on the
line.  It was a beautiful putt that stopped six inches past
the pin.  Now Goldfinger would be sure that unless Bond
sank his difficult twenty-footer, the match was his!
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond went through a long rigmarole of sizing up his
putt.  He took his time, letting the suspense gather like a
thunder cloud round the long shadows on the livid, fateful
green.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Flag out, please.  I'm going to sink this one.'  Bond
charged the words with a deadly certitude, while debating
whether to miss the hole to the right or the left or leave
it short.  He bent to the putt and missed the hole well on
the right.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Missed it, by God!'  Bond put bitterness and rage into
his voice.  He walked over to the hole and picked up the
two balls, keeping them in full view.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger came up.  His face was glistening with
triumph.  'Well, thanks for the game.  Seems I was just too
good for you after all.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'You're a good nine handicap,' said Bond with just
sufficient sourness.  He glanced at the balls in his hand to
pick out Goldfinger's and hand it to him.  He gave a start
of surprise.  'Hullo!'  He looked sharply at Goldfinger.
'You play a Number One Dunlop, don't you?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes, of course.'  A sixth sense of disaster wiped the
triumph off Goldfinger's face.  'What is it?  What's the
matter?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Well,' said Bond apologetically.  ''Fraid you've been
playing with the wrong ball.  Here's my Penfold Hearts and
this is a Number Seven Dunlop.'  He handed both balls
to Goldfinger.  Goldfinger tore them off his palm and
examined them feverishly.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Slowly the colour flooded over Goldfinger's face.  He
stood, his mouth working, looking from the balls to Bond
and back to the balls.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said softly, 'Too bad we were playing to the rules.
Afraid that means you lose the hole.  And, of course, the
match.'  Bond's eyes observed Goldfinger impassively.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'But, but...'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
This was what Bond had been looking forward to—the
cup dashed from the lips.  He stood and waited, saying
nothing.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Rage suddenly burst Goldfinger's usually relaxed face
like a bomb.  'It was a Dunlop Seven you found in the
rough.  It was your caddie that gave me this ball.  On the
seventeenth green.  He gave me the wrong ball on purpose,
the damned che—'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Here, steady on,' said Bond mildly.  'You'll get a slander
action on your hands if you aren't careful.  Hawker, did
you give Mr Goldfinger the wrong ball by mistake or
anything?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'No, sir.'  Hawker's face was stolid.  He said indifferently,
'If you want my opinion, sir, the mistake may have been
made at the seventeenth when the gentleman found his
ball pretty far off the line we'd all marked it on.  A Seven
looks very much like a One.  I'd say that's what happened,
sir.  It would have been a miracle for the gentleman's ball
to have ended up as wide as where it was found.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Tommy rot!'  Goldfinger gave a snort of disgust.  He
turned angrily on Bond.  'You saw that was a Number
One my caddie found.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond shook his head doubtfully.  'I didn't really look
closely, I'm afraid.  However,' Bond's voice became brisk,
businesslike, 'it's really the job of the player to make
certain he's using the right ball, isn't it?  I can't see that
anyone else can be blamed if you tee the wrong ball up
and play three shots with it.  Anyway,' he started walking
off the green, 'many thanks for the match.  We must have
it again one day.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger, lit with glory by the setting sun, but with a
long black shadow tied to his heels, followed Bond slowly,
his eyes fixed thoughtfully on Bond's back.

<h3 class="calibre8">
CHAPTER TEN
<br class="calibre6"/>
UP AT THE GRANGE
</h3>

<p class="calibre4">
There are some rich men who use their riches like
a club.  Bond, luxuriating in his bath, thought that
Goldfinger was one of them.  He was the kind of man
who thought he could flatten the world with his money,
bludgeoning aside annoyances and opposition with his
heavy wad.  He had thought to break Bond's nerve by
playing him for ten thousand dollars—a flea-bite to him
but obviously a small fortune to Bond.  In most circumstances
he might have succeeded.  It needs an iron nerve to
'wait for it' on your swing, to keep your head down on the
short putts, when big money hangs on every shot, over
eighteen long holes.  The pros, playing for their own bread
and butter and for their families', know the cold breath of
the poor-house on the back of their necks as they come to
the eighteenth tee all square.  That is why they lead careful
lives, not smoking or drinking, and why the one that wins
is usually the one with the least imagination.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
But, in Bond's case, Goldfinger could not have known
that high tension was Bond's natural way of life and that
pressure and danger relaxed him.  And he could not have
known that Bond wanted to play Goldfinger for the highest
possible stakes and that he would have the funds of the
Secret Service behind him if he lost.  Goldfinger, so used to
manipulating others, had been blind to the manipulation
for once being practised upon himself.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Or had he been?  Thoughtfully Bond got out of the bath
and dried himself.  That powerful dynamo inside the big
round head would be humming at this very moment,
wondering about Bond, knowing he had been out-cheated,
asking itself how it came about that twice Bond had
appeared out of the blue and twice queered his pitch.  Had
Bond played his cards right?  Had he made himself appear
an interesting challenge, or would Goldfinger's sensitive
nose smell a threat?  In the latter case there would be no
follow-up by Goldfinger and Bond would have to bow out
of the case and leave it to M to devise a new approach.
How soon would he know if the big fish was hooked?  This
one would take plenty of time sniffing the bait.  It would be
good to have just one small bite to tell him he had chosen
the right lure.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There was a knock on the door of his bedroom.  Bond
wrapped the towel round him and walked through.  He
opened the door.  It was the hall porter.  'Yes?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Telephone message from a Mr Goldfinger, sir.  His
compliments and would you care to come to his house for
dinner tonight.  It's The Grange over at Reculver, sir.
Six-thirty for drinks beforehand and not to bother to
dress.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Please thank Mr Goldfinger and say I shall be
delighted.'  Bond shut the door and walked across to the open
window and stood looking out across the quiet evening sea.
'Well, well!  Talk of the devil!'  Bond smiled to himself,
'And then go and sup with him!  What was that about a
long spoon?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
At six o'clock Bond went down to the bar and had a
large vodka and tonic with a slice of lemon peel.  The bar
was empty save for a group of American Air Force officers
from Manston.  They were drinking whisky and water and
talking baseball.  Bond wondered if they had spent the
day toting a hydrogen bomb round the skies over Kent,
over the four little dots in the dunes that had been his
match with Goldfinger.  He thought wryly, Not too much
of that whisky, cousins, paid for his drink, and left.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
He motored slowly over to Reculver, savouring the
evening and the drink inside him and the quiet bubble of
the twin exhausts.  This was going to be an interesting
dinner-party.  Now was the moment to sell himself to
Goldfinger.  If he put a foot wrong he was out, and the
pitch would have been badly queered for his successor.
He was unarmed—it would be fatal for Goldfinger to
smell that kind of rat.  He felt a moment's qualm.  But
that was going too fast.  No state of war had been
declared—the opposite if anything.  When they had parted at the
golf club, Goldfinger had been cordial in a rather forced,
oily fashion.  He had inquired where he should send Bond's
winnings and Bond had given him the address of Universal
Export.  He had asked where Bond was staying and Bond
had told him and added that he would only be at
Ramsgate a few days while he made up his mind about his
future.  Goldfinger hoped that they would one day have a
return match but, alas, he was leaving for France
tomorrow and wasn't certain when he would be back.
Flying?  Yes, taking the Air Ferry from Lydd.  Well,
thanks for the match.  And thank you, Mr Bond.  The eyes
had given Bond one last X-ray treatment, as if fixing him
for a last time in Goldfinger's filing system, and then the
big yellow car had sighed away.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond had had a good look at the chauffeur.  He was a
chunky flat-faced Japanese, or more probably Korean,
with a wild, almost mad glare in dramatically slanting
eyes that belonged in a Japanese film rather than in a
Rolls Royce on a sunny afternoon in Kent.  He had the
snout-like upper lip that sometimes goes with a cleft palate,
but he said nothing and Bond had no opportunity of
knowing whether his guess was right.  In his tight, almost
bursting black suit and farcical bowler hat he looked rather
like a Japanese wrestler on his day off.  But he was not a
figure to make one smile.  If one had been inclined to
smile, a touch of the sinister, the unexplained, in the
tight shining patent-leather black shoes that were almost
dancing pumps, and in the heavy black leather driving
gloves, would have changed one's mind.  There was something
vaguely familiar to Bond in the man's silhouette.  It
was when the car drove away and Bond had a glimpse of
the head from the rear that he remembered.  Those were
the head and shoulders and bowler hat of the driver of the
sky-blue Ford Popular that had so obstinately hugged
the crown of the Herne Bay road at about twelve o'clock
that morning.  Where had he been coming from?  What
errand had he been on?  Bond remembered something
Colonel Smithers had said.  Could this have been the
Korean who now travelled the country collecting the old
gold from the chain of Goldfinger jewellery shops?  Had
the boot of the innocent, scurrying little saloon been stuffed
with the week's takings of presentation watches, signet
rings, lockets, gold crosses?  As he watched the high,
primrose-yellow silhouette of the Silver Ghost disappearing
towards Sandwich, Bond thought the answer was yes.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond turned off the main road into the drive and
followed it down between high Victorian evergreens to the
gravel sweep in front of just the sort of house that would
be called The Grange—a heavy, ugly, turn-of-the-century
mansion with a glass-enclosed portico and sun parlour
whose smell of trapped sunshine, rubber plants and dead
flies came to Bond in his imagination before he had
switched off the engine.  Bond got slowly out of the car
and stood looking at the house.  Its blank, well-washed
eyes stared back at him.  The house had a background
noise, a heavy rhythmic pant like a huge animal with a
rather quick pulse.  Bond assumed it came from the factory
whose plumed chimney reared up like a giant cautionary
finger from the high conifers to the right where the stabling
and garages would normally be.  The quiet watchful
façade of the house seemed to be waiting for Bond to do
something, make some offensive move to which there
would be a quick reply.  Bond shrugged his shoulders to
lighten his thoughts and went up the steps to the opaque
glass-panelled door and pressed the bell.  There was no
noise of it ringing, but the door slowly opened.  The
Korean chauffeur still had his bowler hat on.  He looked
without interest at Bond.  He stood motionless, his left
hand on the inside doorknob and his outstretched right
pointing like a signpost into the dark hall of the house.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond walked past him, vanquishing a desire either to
stamp on his neat black feet or hit him very hard indeed
in the centre of his tightly buttoned black stomach.  This
Korean matched up with what he had always heard
about Koreans, and anyway Bond wanted to do something
violent to the heavy, electric atmosphere of the house.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The gloomy hall was also the main living-room.  A
meagre fire flickered behind the fire-irons in the wide
hearth and two club chairs and a Knole sofa stood
impassively watching the flames.  Between them on a low settee
was a well-stocked drink tray.  The wide spaces surrounding
this spark of life were crowded with massive Rothschildian
pieces of furniture of the Second Empire, and
ormolu, tortoiseshell, brass and mother-of-pearl winked
back richly at the small fire.  Behind this orderly museum,
dark panelling ran up to a first-floor gallery which was
reached by a heavy curved stairway to the left of the hall.
The ceiling was laced with the sombre wood-carving of the
period.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond was standing taking all this in when the Korean
came silently up.  He flung out his signpost of an arm
towards the drink tray and the chairs.  Bond nodded
and stayed where he was.  The Korean walked past him
and disappeared through a door into what Bond assumed
were the servants' quarters.  The silence, helped by the
slow iron tick of a massively decorated grandfather clock,
gathered and crept nearer.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond walked over and stood with his back to the poor
fire.  He stared offensively back at the room.  What a dump!
What a bloody awful deathly place to live in.  How did one,
could one, live in this rich heavy morgue amongst the
conifers and evergreens when a hundred yards away there
was light and air and wide horizons?  Bond took out a
cigarette and lit it.  What did Goldfinger do for enjoyment,
for fun, for sex?  Perhaps he didn't need these things.
Perhaps the pursuit of gold slaked all his thirsts.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Somewhere in the distance a telephone rang.  The bell
shrilled twice and stopped.  There was the murmur of a
voice, then steps echoed down a passage and a door under
the stairway opened.  Goldfinger came through and quietly
closed the door behind him.  He was wearing a plum-coloured
velvet dinner jacket.  He came slowly across the
polished wood floor.  He didn't hold out his hand.  He said,
smiling with his mouth, 'It was kind of you to come at such
short notice, Mr Bond.  You were alone and so was I and
it occurred to me that we might discuss the price of corn.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
It was the sort of remark that rich men make to each
other.  Bond was amused at being made a temporary
member of the club.  He said, 'I was delighted to get the
invitation.  I was already bored with worrying over my
problems.  Ramsgate hasn't much to offer.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'No.  And now I have an apology to make.  I have had a
telephone call.  One of my staff—I employ Koreans, by
the way—has had some minor trouble with the Margate
police and I must go over and straighten it out.  Some
incident at the fun fair, I understand.  These people get
easily over-excited.  My chauffeur will drive me and we
should not be more than half an hour.  Meanwhile I fear I
must leave you to your own devices.  Please help yourself to
drinks.  There are magazines to read.  Will you forgive me?
Not more than half an hour I assure you.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'That's quite all right.'  Bond felt there was something
fishy in this.  He couldn't put his finger on what it was.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Well then, au revoir.'  Goldfinger went to the front
door.  'But I must give you some light.  It's really very dark
in here.'  Goldfinger brushed his hand down a wall-plate
of switches and suddenly lights blazed all over the
hall—from standard lamps, wall brackets, and four clusters in
the ceiling.  Now the room was as bright as a film studio.
It was an extraordinary transformation.  Bond, half
dazzled, watched Goldfinger open the front door and
stride out.  In a minute he heard the sound of a car, but not
the Rolls, rev up noisily, change gear and go off fast down
the drive.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
On an instinct, Bond walked over to the front door and
opened it.  The drive was empty.  In the distance he saw
the lights of the car turn left-handed on the main road and
make off in the direction of Margate.  He turned back into
the house and closed the door.  He stood still, listening.
The silence, except for the heavy clock-tick, was complete.
He walked across to the service door and opened it.  A
long dark passage disappeared towards the back of the
house.  Bond bent forward, all his senses alert.  Silence,
dead silence.  Bond shut the door and looked thoughtfully
round the brilliantly lit hall.  He had been left alone in
Goldfinger's house, alone with its secrets.  Why?
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond walked over to the drink tray and poured himself
a strong gin and tonic.  There certainly had been a
telephone call, but it could easily have been an arranged call
from the factory.  The story of the servant was plausible and
it was reasonable that Goldfinger should go himself to bail
the man out and take his chauffeur with him.  Goldfinger
had twice mentioned that Bond would be alone for half an
hour during which he 'would be left to his own devices'.
This could be innocent, or it could be an invitation for
Bond to show his hand, commit some indiscretion.  Was
somebody watching him?  How many of these Koreans
were there and what were they doing?  Bond glanced at his
watch.  Five minutes had gone.  He made up his mind.
Trap or no trap, this was too good a chance to miss.  He
would have a quick look round—but an innocent one,
with some sort of a cover story to explain why he had left
the hall.  Where should he begin?  A look at the factory.
His story?  That his car had given trouble on the way
over—choked petrol feed probably—and that he had gone to
see if there was a mechanic who could give him a hand.
Flimsy, but it would do.  Bond downed his drink and went
purposefully to the service door and walked through.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There was a light switch.  He turned on the light and
walked swiftly down a long passage.  It ended with a
blank wall and two doors to right and left.  He listened for
an instant at the left-hand one and heard muffled kitchen
noises.  He opened the right-hand door and found himself
in the paved garage yard he might have expected.  The
only odd thing about it was that it was brilliantly lit by
arc lights.  The long wall of the factory occupied the far
side and now the rhythmic engine thump was very loud.
There was a plain wooden door low down in the wall
opposite.  Bond walked across the yard to it, looking around
him with casual interest.  The door was unlocked.  He
opened it with discretion and walked through, leaving the
door ajar.  He found himself in a small empty office lit by
one naked bulb hanging from the ceiling.  There was a
desk with papers on it, a time-clock, a couple of filing
cabinets and a telephone.  Another door led from the office
into the main factory space and there was a window beside
the door for keeping an eye on the workmen.  It would be
the foreman's office.  Bond walked to the window and
looked through.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond didn't know what he had expected, but there
seemed to be the usual accoutrements of a small
metal-working business.  Facing him were the open mouths of
two blast furnaces, their fires now drawn.  Beside these
stood a row of kilns for the molten metal, of which sheets of
different sizes and colours stood against the wall near by.
There was the polished steel table of a circular saw, a
diamond saw presumably, for cutting the sheets, and to the
left in the shadows a big oil engine connected to a
generator pounded away making power.  To the right,
under arc lights, a group of five men in overalls, four of
them Koreans, were at work on—of all things—Goldfinger's
Rolls Royce.  It stood there gleaming under the
lights, immaculate save for the right-hand door which had
been taken off its hinges and now lay across two near-by
benches minus its door panel.  As Bond watched, two men
picked up the new door panel, a heavy, discoloured sheet
of aluminium-coloured metal, and placed it on the door
frame.  There were two hand riveters on the floor and
soon, Bond thought, the men would rivet the panel into
place and paint it to match the rest of the car.  All
perfectly innocent and above-board.  Goldfinger had dented
the panel that afternoon and had had a quick repair job
done in preparation for his trip tomorrow.  Bond gave a
quick, sour look round, withdrew from the window and
went out by the factory door and closed it softly behind
him.  Nothing there, damn it.  And now what was his
story?  That he had not wanted to disturb the men at their
work—perhaps after dinner, if one of them had a moment.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond walked unhurriedly back the way he had come
and regained the hall without misadventure.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond looked at his watch.  Ten minutes to go.  Now for
the first floor.  The secrets of a house are in the bedrooms
and bathrooms.  Those are the private places where the
medicine cabinets, the dressing-table, the bedside drawers,
reveal the intimate things, the frailties.  Bond had a bad
headache.  He had gone to look for an aspirin.  He acted
the part for an invisible audience, massaged his temples,
glanced up at the gallery, walked decisively across the
floor and climbed the stairs.  The gallery gave on to a
brightly lit passage.  Bond walked down it opening the
doors and glancing in.  But they were spare bedrooms, the
beds not made up.  They held a smell of must and shut
windows.  A large ginger cat appeared from nowhere and
followed him, mewing and rubbing itself against his
trouser legs.  The end room was the one.  Bond went in and
closed the door to a crack.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
All the lights were on.  Perhaps one of the servants was
in the bathroom.  Bond walked boldly across to the
communicating door and opened it.  More lights, but no one.
It was a big bathroom, probably a spare room converted
into a bathroom and, in addition to the bath and lavatory,
it held various fitness machines—a rowing machine, a
fixed bicycle wheel, Indian clubs and a Ralli Health
Belt.  The medicine cabinet contained nothing except a
great variety of purges—senna pods, cascara, Calsalettes,
Enos and various apparatus for the same purpose.  There
were no other drugs and no aspirin.  Bond went back into
the bedroom and again drew a blank.  It was a typical
man's room, comfortable, lived in, with plenty of fitted
cupboards.  It even smelled neutral.  There was a small
bookcase beside the bed in which all the books were
history or biography, all in English.  The drawer of the
bedside table yielded a solitary indiscretion, a
yellow-backed copy of <i class="calibre3">The Hidden Sight of Love</i>, Palladium
Publications, Paris.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond glanced at his watch.  Five more minutes.  It was
time to go.  He took a last look round the room and moved
to the door.  Suddenly he stopped.  What was it he had
noticed almost subconsciously ever since he had come into
the room?  He sharpened his senses.  There was an
incongruity somewhere.  What was it?  A colour?  An object?  A
smell?  A sound?  That was it!  From where he stood he
could hear the faintest, mosquito-shrill whine.  It was
almost extra-sensory in its pitch.  Where did it come from?
What was making it?  Now there was something else in the
room, something that Bond knew all too well, the smell of
danger.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Tensely Bond stepped closer to the fitted cupboard
beside the door, softly opened it.  Yes, it came from inside
the cupboard, from behind a range of sports coats that
reached down to the top of three banks of drawers.
Sharply Bond swept the coats aside.  His jaws clenched at
what was behind them.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
From three slots near the top of the cupboard, sixteen-millimetre
film was inching down in three separate strips
into a deep bin behind the false front of the drawers.  The
bin was almost half full of the slimy snakes of the stuff.
Bond's eyes narrowed tensely as he watched the damning
evidence coil slowly down on to the pile.  So that was
it—cine-cameras, three of them, their lenses concealed God
knows where—in the hall, in the garage courtyard, in
this room—had been watching his every move from the
moment Goldfinger had left the house, switching on the
cameras, and, of course, the dazzling lights, as he went out
of the door.  Why hadn't Bond seen the significance of
those lights?  Why hadn't he had the elementary imagination
to see the trap as well as smell it?  Cover stories, indeed!
What use were they now when he had spent half an hour
snooping round and finding nothing for his pains?  That
too!  He had discovered nothing—unearthed no secret.  It
had all been an idiotic waste of time.  And now Goldfinger
had him.  Now he was finished, hopelessly blown.  Was
there any way of saving something from the wreckage?
Bond stood riveted, staring at the slow cataracts of film.
Let's see now!  Bond's mind raced, thinking of ways out,
excuses, discarding them all.  Well, at least by opening the
cupboard door he had exposed some of the film.  Then why
not expose it all?  Why not, but how?  How could the open
cupboard door be explained except by his doing?  There
came a miaow from the open slit of the bedroom door.
The cat!  Why shouldn't the cat have done it?  Pretty thin,
but at least it was the shadow of an alibi.  Bond opened the
door.  He picked the cat up in his arms.  He went back with
it to the cupboard, stroking it brusquely.  It purred.  Bond
leant over the bin of film, picking it up in handfuls so that
it would all get the light.  Then, when he was satisfied that
it must be ruined, he tossed it back and dropped the cat in
on top of it.  The cat would not be able to get out easily.
With any luck it would settle down and go to sleep.  Bond
left the cupboard door three inches ajar to spoil the
continuing film and the bedroom door the same amount and
ran down the passage.  At the top of the stairs he slowed and
sauntered down.  The empty hall yawned at his play-acting.
He walked across to the fireplace, dashed more drink into
his glass and picked up <i class="calibre3">The Field</i>.  He turned to the golf
commentary by Bernard Darwin, ran his eye down it to
see what it was about, and then settled into one of the club
chairs and lit a cigarette.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
What had he found out?  What was there on the plus
side?  Precious little except that Goldfinger suffered from
constipation and a dirty mind and that he had wanted to
put Bond through an elementary test.  He had certainly
done it expertly.  This was no amateur.  The technique
was fully up to SMERSH standards, and it was surely the
technique of somebody with a very great deal to hide.
And now what would happen?  For the cat alibi to stand
up, Goldfinger would have to have left two doors, one of
them vital, ajar, and the cat had got into the room and
been intrigued by the whine of the cameras.  Most unlikely,
almost incredible.  Goldfinger would be ninety per cent
certain it was Bond—but only ninety.  There would still
be that ten per cent of uncertainty.  Would Goldfinger
have learnt much more than he knew before—that Bond
was a tricky, resourceful customer and that Bond had
been inquisitive, might be a thief?  He would guess Bond
had been to the bedroom, but Bond's other movements,
for whatever they were worth, would remain a secret on
the exposed film.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond got up and took a handful of other magazines and
threw them down beside his chair.  The only thing for
him to do was brazen it out and make a note for the future,
if there was to be a future, that he had better wake his
ideas up and not make any more mistakes.  There wouldn't
be enough ginger cats in the world to help him out of one
more tight spot like the one he was in.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There had been no noise of a car coming down the
drive, not a sound from the door, but Bond felt the evening
breeze on his neck and he knew that Goldfinger had come
back into the room.

CHAPTER ELEVEN
<br class="calibre6"/>
THE ODD-JOB MAN
</h3>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond threw down <i class="calibre3">The Field</i> and stood up.  The front
door closed noisily.  Bond turned.  'Hullo.'  His face
registered polite surprise.  'Didn't hear you arrive.
How did it go?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger's expression was equally bland.  They might
have been old friends, neighbours in the country who were
accustomed to drop in on each other for a drink.  'Oh, it
sorted itself out.  My chap had had a row in a pub with
some American Air Force men who had called him a
bloody Jap.  I explained to the police that Koreans don't
like being called Japs.  They let him off with a caution.
Terribly sorry to have been so long.  Hope you weren't
bored.  Do have another drink.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Thanks.  But it's hardly seemed five minutes since you
left.  Been reading what Darwin has to say about the
fourteen club rule.  Interesting point of view...'  Bond
launched into a detailed review of the article, adding his
own comments on the rule.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger stood patiently until it was over.  He said,
'Yes, it's a complicated business.  Of course you play
rather a different game from me, more workmanlike.
With my kind of swing, I find I need all the clubs I'm
allowed.  Well, I'll just go up and wash and then we'll
have dinner.  Shan't be a moment.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond busied himself noisily with pouring another drink,
sat down and picked up <i class="calibre3">Country Life</i>.  He watched
Goldfinger climb the stairs and disappear down the corridor.
He could visualize every step.  He found he was reading
the periodical upside down.  He turned it round and stared
blindly at a fine photograph of Blenheim Palace.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There was dead silence upstairs.  Then a distant
lavatory chain was pulled and a door clicked shut.  Bond
reached for his drink, took a deep swallow and put the
glass down beside his chair.  Goldfinger was coming down
the stairs.  Bond turned the pages of <i class="calibre3">Country Life</i> and flicked
ash off his cigarette into the grate.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Now Goldfinger was crossing the floor towards him.
Bond lowered his paper and looked up.  Goldfinger was
carrying the ginger cat tucked carelessly under one arm.
He reached the fireplace, bent forward and pressed the bell.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
He turned towards Bond.  'Do you like cats?'  His gaze
was flat, incurious.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Sufficiently.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The service door opened.  The chauffeur stood in the
frame.  He still wore his bowler hat and his shiny black
gloves.  He gazed impassively at Goldfinger.  Goldfinger
crooked a finger.  The chauffeur approached and stood
within the circle by the fire.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger turned to Bond.  He said conversationally,
'This is my handy man.'  He smiled thinly.  'That is
something of a joke.  Oddjob, show Mr Bond your hands.'  He
smiled again at Bond.  'I call him Oddjob because that
describes his functions on my staff.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The Korean slowly pulled off his gloves and came and
stood at arm's length from Bond and held out his hands
palm upwards.  Bond got up and looked at them.  They
were big and fat with muscle.  The fingers all seemed to be
the same length.  They were very blunt at the tips and the
tips glinted as if they were made of yellow bone.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Turn them over and show Mr Bond the sides.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There were no finger-nails.  Instead there was this same,
yellowish carapace.  The man turned the hands sideways.
Down each edge of the hands was a hard ridge of the same
bony substance.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond raised his eyebrows at Goldfinger.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger said, 'We will have a demonstration.'  He
pointed at the thick oak banisters that ran up the stairs.
The rail was a massive six inches by four thick.  The
Korean obediently walked over to the stairs and climbed a
few steps.  He stood with his hands at his sides, gazing
across at Goldfinger like a good retriever.  Goldfinger
gave a quick nod.  Impassively the Korean lifted his right
hand high and straight above his head and brought the
side of it down like an axe across the heavy polished rail.
There was a splintering crash and the rail sagged, broken
through the centre.  Again the hand went up and flashed
down.  This time it swept right through the rail leaving a
jagged gap.  Splinters clattered down on to the floor of
the hall.  The Korean straightened himself and stood to
attention, waiting for further orders.  There was no flush of
effort in his face and no hint of pride in his achievement.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger beckoned.  The man came back across the
floor.  Goldfinger said, 'His feet are the same, the outside
edges of them.  Oddjob, the mantelpiece.'  Goldfinger
pointed at the heavy shelf of carved wood above the
fireplace.  It was about seven feet off the ground—six inches
higher than the top of the Korean's bowler hat.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Garch a har?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes, take off your coat and hat.'  Goldfinger turned to
Bond.  'Poor chap's got a cleft palate.  I shouldn't think
there are many people who understand him beside me.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond reflected how useful that would be, a slave who
could only communicate with the world through his
interpreter—better even than the deaf mutes of the
harems, more tightly bound to his master, more secure.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Oddjob had taken off his coat and hat and placed them
neatly on the floor.  Now he rolled his trouser legs up to the
knee and stood back in the wide well-planted stance of the
judo expert.  He looked as if a charging elephant wouldn't
put him off balance.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Better stand back, Mr Bond.'  The teeth glittered in the
wide mouth.  'This blow snaps a man's neck like a
daffodil.'  Goldfinger drew aside the low settee with the
drink tray.  Now the Korean had a clear run.  But he was
only three long steps away.  How could he possibly reach
the high mantelpiece?
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond watched, fascinated.  Now the slanting eyes in the
flat yellow mask were glinting with a fierce intentness.
Faced by such a man, thought Bond, one could only go
down on one's knees and wait for death.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger lifted his hand.  The bunched toes in the
polished soft leather shoes seemed to grip the ground.  The
Korean took one long crouching stride with knees well
bent and then whirled off the ground.  In mid-air his feet
slapped together like a ballet dancer's, but higher than a
ballet dancer's have ever reached, and then the body bent
sideways and downwards and the right foot shot out like
a piston.  There came a crashing thud.  Gracefully the body
settled back down on the hands, now splayed on the floor,
the elbows bent to take the weight and then straightened
sharply to throw the man up and back on his feet.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Oddjob stood to attention.  This time there was a gleam
of triumph in his flat eyes as he looked at the three-inch
jagged bite the edge of his foot had taken out of the
mantelpiece.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond looked at the man in deep awe.  And only two
nights ago he, Bond, had been working on his manual of
unarmed combat!  There was nothing, absolutely nothing,
in all his reading, all his experience, to approach what he
had just witnessed.  This was not a man of flesh and blood.
This was a living club, perhaps the most dangerous animal
on the face of the earth.  Bond had to do it, had to give
homage to this uniquely dreadful person.  He held out his
hand.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Softly, Oddjob.'  Goldfinger's voice was the crack of
a whip.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The Korean bowed his head and took Bond's hand in
his.  He kept his fingers straight and merely bent his
thumb in a light clasp.  It was like holding a piece of
board.  He released Bond's hand and went to his neat pile
of clothes.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Forgive me, Mr Bond, and I appreciate your
gesture.'  Goldfinger's face showed his approval.  'But Oddjob
doesn't know his own strength—particularly when he is
keyed up.  And those hands are like machine-tools.  He
could have crushed your hand to pulp without meaning
to.  Now then,' Oddjob had dressed and was standing
respectfully at attention, 'you did well, Oddjob.  I'm glad
to see you are in training.  Here—'  Goldfinger took the
cat from under his arm and tossed it to the Korean who
caught it eagerly—'I am tired of seeing this animal
around.  You may have it for dinner.'  The Korean's eyes
gleamed.  'And tell them in the kitchen that we will have
our own dinner at once.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The Korean inclined his head sharply and turned away.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond hid his disgust.  He realized that all this exhibition
was simply a message to him, a warning, a light rap on
the knuckles.  It said, 'You see my power, Mr Bond.  I could
easily have killed you or maimed you.  Oddjob was giving
an exhibition and you got in the way.  I would certainly
be innocent, and Oddjob would get off with a light
sentence.  Instead, the cat will be punished in your place.
Bad luck on the cat, of course.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said casually, 'Why does the man always wear
that bowler hat?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Oddjob!'  The Korean had reached the service door.
'The hat.'  Goldfinger pointed at a panel in the woodwork
near the fireplace.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Still holding the cat under his left arm, Oddjob
turned and walked stolidly back towards them.  When he
was half way across the floor, and without pausing or
taking aim, he reached up to his hat, took it by the rim
and flung it sideways with all his force.  There was a
loud clang.  For an instant the rim of the bowler hat stuck
an inch deep in the panel Goldfinger had indicated, then it
fell and clattered on the floor.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger smiled politely at Bond.  'A light but very
strong alloy, Mr Bond.  I fear that will have damaged the
felt covering, but Oddjob will put on another.  He's
surprisingly quick with a needle and thread.  As you can
imagine, that blow would have smashed a man's skull or
half severed his neck.  A homely and a most ingeniously
concealed weapon, I'm sure you'll agree.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes, indeed.'  Bond smiled with equal politeness.
'Useful chap to have around.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Oddjob had picked up his hat and disappeared.  There
came the boom of a gong.  'Ah, dinner!  Shall we go
in?'  Goldfinger led the way to a door concealed in the panelling
to the right of the fireplace.  He pressed a hidden latch
and they walked through.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The small dining-room matched the heavy wealth of
the hall.  It was brilliantly lit from a central chandelier
and by candles on a round table that glittered with silver
and glass.  They sat down opposite each other.  Two
yellow-faced servants in white mess-jackets brought dishes from
a loaded serving-table.  The first course was some curried
mess with rice.  Goldfinger noticed Bond's hesitation.  He
gave a dry chuckle.  'It's all right, Mr Bond.  Shrimp, not
the cat.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Ah.'  Bond's expression was non-committal.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Please try the Hock.  I hope it will be to your taste.
It is a Piesporter Goldtröpfchen '53.  Help yourself.
These people are as likely to pour it into your plate as your
glass.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There was a slim bottle in an ice bucket in front of
Bond.  He poured some of the wine and tasted it.  It was
nectar and ice cold.  Bond congratulated his host.
Goldfinger gave a curt nod.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I don't myself drink or smoke, Mr Bond.  Smoking I
find the most ridiculous of all the varieties of human
behaviour and practically the only one that is entirely
against nature.  Can you imagine a cow or any animal
taking a mouthful of smouldering straw then breathing in
the smoke and blowing it out through its nostrils?
Pah!'  Goldfinger showed a rare trace of emotion.  'It is a vile
practice.  As for drinking, I am something of a chemist and
I have yet to find a liquor that is free from traces of a
number of poisons, some of them deadly, such as fusel oil,
acetic acid, ethylacetate, acetaldehyde and furfurol.  A
quantity of some of these poisons taken neat would kill
you.  In the small amounts you find in a bottle of liquor
they produce various ill effects most of which are lightly
written off as "a hangover".'  Goldfinger paused with a
forkful of curried shrimp half way to his mouth.  'Since
you are a drinker, Mr Bond, I will give you one word of
good advice.  Never drink so-called Napoleon brandy,
particularly when it is described as "aged in the wood".
That particular potion contains more of the poisons I have
mentioned than any other liquor I have analysed.  Old
bourbon comes next.'  Goldfinger closed his
animadversions with a mouthful of shrimp.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Thank you.  I'll remember.  Perhaps for those reasons I
have recently taken to vodka.  They tell me its filtration
through activated charcoal is a help.'  Bond, dredging this
piece of expertise out of dim recollections of something he
had read, was rather proud of having been able to return
Goldfinger's powerful serve.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger glanced at him sharply.  'You seem to
understand something of these matters.  Have you studied
chemistry?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Only dabbled in it.'  It was time to move on.  'I was
very impressed by that chauffeur of yours.  Where did he
learn that fantastic combat stuff?  Where did it come from?
Is that what the Koreans use?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger patted his mouth with his napkin.  He
snapped his fingers.  The two men cleared away the plates
and brought roast duckling and a bottle of Mouton
Rothschild 1947 for Bond.  When they had withdrawn into
immobility at each end of the serving-table, Goldfinger
said, 'Have you ever heard of Karate?  No?  Well that man
is one of the three in the world who have achieved the
Black Belt in Karate.  Karate is a branch of judo, but it is
to judo what a Spandau is to a catapult.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I could see that.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'The demonstration was an elementary one.  Mr
Bond—' Goldfinger held up the drumstick he had been
gnawing—'I can tell you that if Oddjob had used the appropriate
single blow on any one of seven spots on your body, you
would now be dead.'  Goldfinger bit at the side of the
drumstick with relish.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said seriously, 'That's interesting.  I only know
five ways of killing Oddjob with one blow.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger seemed not to hear the comment.  He put
down his drumstick and took a deep draught of water.  He
sat back and spoke while Bond went on eating the excellent
food.  'Karate, Mr Bond, is based on the theory that
the human body possesses five striking surfaces and thirty-seven
vulnerable spots—vulnerable, that is, to an expert in
Karate whose finger-tips, the side of the hands and the
feet are hardened into layers of corn, which is far stronger
and more flexible than bone.  Every day of his life, Mr
Bond, Oddjob spends one hour hitting either sacks of
unpolished rice or a strong post whose top is wound many
times round with thick rope.  He then spends another hour
at physical training which is more that of a ballet school
than of a gymnasium.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'When does he practise tossing the bowler hat?'  Bond
had no intention of succumbing to this psychological
warfare.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger frowned at the interruption.  'I have never
inquired,' he said without humour.  'But I think you can
take it that Oddjob keeps his eye in at all his skills.
However, you were asking where Karate originated.  It
originated in China where wandering Buddhist priests
became an easy prey for footpads and bandits.  Their
religion did not allow them to carry weapons, so they
developed their own form of unarmed combat.  The
inhabitants of Okinawa refined the art to its present form
when the Japanese forbade them to carry weapons.  They
developed the five striking surfaces of the human body—the
fist, the edge of the hand, the finger-tips, the ball of
the foot and the elbows—and toughened them until they
were enveloped in layers of corn.  There is no follow-through
in a Karate blow.  The entire body is stiffened at
the moment of impact, with the emphasis on the hips, and
then instantly relaxed so that balance is never lost.  It is
astonishing what Oddjob can do.  I have seen him hit a
brick wall with his entire force and not hurt his hand.  He
can split three half-inch thick boards, piled one upon the
other, with one blow of his hand.  You have seen what he
can do with his foot.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond took a deep draught of the delicious claret.  'All
this must be rather hard on your furniture.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger shrugged.  'I have no more use for this
house.  I thought a demonstration would amuse you.  I
hope you agree that Oddjob earned his cat.'  The X-ray
eyes blazed briefly across the table.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Does he train on cats?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'He regards them as a great delicacy.  He acquired the
taste during a famine in his country when he was young.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond thought it was time to delve rather more deeply.
'Why do you need such a man?  He can't be very good
company.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Mr Bond—' Goldfinger snapped his fingers for the two
servants—'it happens that I am a rich man, a very rich
man, and the richer the man the more he needs protection.
The ordinary bodyguard or detective is usually a retired
policeman.  Such men are valueless.  Their reactions are
slow, their methods old-fashioned, and they are open to
bribery.  Moreover, they have a respect for human life.
That is no good if I wish to stay alive.  The Koreans have
no such feelings.  That is why the Japanese employed them
as guards for their prison camps during the war.  They are
the cruellest, most ruthless people in the world.  My own
staff are hand picked for these qualities.  They have served
me well.  I have no complaints.  Nor have they.  They are
well paid and well fed and housed.  When they want
women, street women are brought down from London,
well remunerated for their services and sent back.  The
women are not much to look at, but they are white and
that is all the Koreans ask—to submit the white race to
the grossest indignities.  There are sometimes accidents
but—' the pale eyes gazed blankly down the table—'money
is an effective winding-sheet.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond smiled.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'You like the aphorism?  It is my own.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
An excellent cheese soufflé came and was followed by
coffee.  They ate in silence, both apparently comfortable
and relaxed by these confidences.  Bond certainly was.
Goldfinger, obviously by design, was letting his hair
down—not far, not farther than his shoulders, but he was
showing Bond one of his private faces, presumably the one
to which he thought Bond would respond—the ruthlessly
efficient, cold-blooded tycoon.  Perhaps, after all, Bond's
spying in the house, which Goldfinger must at least
presume, had revealed something about Bond that
Goldfinger was pleased to know—that Bond had a crooked
side to him, that he wasn't 'a gentleman' in more than
appearance.  Now there should be more probing and then,
with luck, the proposition would follow.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond sat back and lit a cigarette.  He said, 'That's a
beautiful car you've got.  Must be about the last of the
series.  About 1925, wasn't it—two blocks of three
cylinders with two plugs for each cylinder, one set fired
from the mag. and the other from the coil?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'You are correct.  But in other respects I have had to
introduce some modifications.  I have added five leaves
to the springs and fitted disc brakes to the rear wheels to
increase the braking power.  The Servo-operated
front-wheel brakes were not sufficient.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Oh.  Why not?  The top speed wouldn't be more than
fifty.  The body can't be all that heavy.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger raised his eyebrows.  'You think not?  One
ton of armour plating and armour-plated glass make a
big difference.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond smiled.  'Ah!  I see.  You certainly do take good care
of yourself.  But how does that work flying the Channel?
Doesn't the car go through the floor of the plane?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I take a plane to myself.  The Silver City company
knows the car.  It is a regular routine, twice a year.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Just touring round Europe?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'A golfing holiday.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Great fun.  Always wanted to do it myself.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger didn't take the bait.  'You can afford to now.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond smiled.  'Oh, that extra ten thousand dollars.  But
I may need that if I decide to move to Canada.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'You think you could make money there?  Do you want
to make a lot of money?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond's voice was eager.  'Very much.  There's no other
point in working.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Unfortunately most ways of making big money take a
long time.  By the time one has made the money one is too
old to enjoy it.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'That's the trouble.  I'm always on the look-out for
short-cuts.  You won't find them here.  Taxation's too
heavy.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Quite.  And the laws are strict.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes.  I found that out.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Indeed?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Got on the fringe of the heroin racket.  Only just got
out without burning my fingers.  Of course this'll go no
further?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger shrugged his shoulders.  'Mr Bond, someone
said that "law is the crystallized prejudices of the
community".  I agree with that definition.  It happens to apply
most strongly to the traffic in drugs.  Even if it didn't, I am
not concerned with assisting the police.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Well, it was like this...'  Bond launched into the story
of the Mexican traffic, swapping roles with Blackwell.  He
ended up, 'I was lucky to get away with it, but it didn't
make me particularly popular with Universal Export.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I daresay not.  An interesting story.  You seem to have
shown resource.  You are not tempted to continue in the
same line of business?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond shrugged his shoulders.  'A bit too tricky.  To judge
by this Mexican, the big men in the business aren't quite
big enough when it comes to the pinch.  When things got
tough he didn't fight back—except with his mouth.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Well, Mr Bond,' Goldfinger got up from the table and
Bond followed suit.  'It's been an interesting evening.  I
don't know that I would go back into heroin.  There are
safer ways of making big money.  You want to be certain
that the odds are right and then you should hazard
everything.  Doubling one's money isn't easy and the
chances don't occur frequently.  You would like to hear
another of my aphorisms?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Well, Mr Bond,' Goldfinger gave the rich man's thin
smile.  'The safest way to double your money is fold it twice
and put it in your pocket.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond, the bank clerk harkening to the bank manager,
smiled dutifully but made no comment.  This just wasn't
good enough.  He was getting nowhere.  But instinct told
him not to put his foot down on the accelerator.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
They went back into the hall.  Bond held out his hand.
'Well, many thanks for the excellent dinner.  Time I went
and got some sleep.  Perhaps we shall run into each other
again some day.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger pressed Bond's hand briefly and pushed it
away from him.  It was another mannerism of the millionaire
subconsciously afraid of 'the touch'.  He looked hard at
Bond.  He said enigmatically, 'I shouldn't be at all
surprised, Mr Bond.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
On his way across the Isle of Thanet in the moonlight,
Bond turned the phrase over and over in his mind.  He
undressed and got into bed thinking of it, unable to guess
its significance.  It could mean that Goldfinger intended to
get in touch with Bond, or it could mean that Bond must
try and keep in touch with Goldfinger.  Heads the former,
tails the latter.  Bond got out of bed and took a coin from
the dressing-table and tossed it.  It came down tails.  So it
was up to him to keep close to Goldfinger!
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
So be it.  But his cover would have to be pretty darn
good the next time they 'ran into' each other.  Bond got
back into bed and was instantly asleep.

CHAPTER TWELVE

LONG TAIL ON A GHOST
</h3>

<p class="calibre4">
Punctually at nine the next morning Bond got on
to the Chief of Staff: 'James here.  I've had a look at
the property.  Been all over it.  Had dinner last night
with the owner.  I can say pretty well for certain that the
managing director's view is right.  Something definitely
wrong about the property.  Not enough facts to send you a
surveyor's report.  Owner's going abroad tomorrow, flying
from Ferryfield.  Wish I knew his departure time.  Like to
have another sight of his Rolls.  Thought I'd make him a
present of a portable wireless set.  I'll be going over a bit
later in the day.  Could you get Miss Ponsonby to book
me?  Destination unknown for the present.  I'll be keeping
in touch.  Anything your end?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'How did the game of golf go?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I won.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There was a chuckle at the other end.  'Thought you
had.  Pretty big stakes, weren't they?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'How did you know?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Had Mr Scotland on last night.  Said he'd had a
tip on the telephone that someone of your name was in
possession of a large amount of undeclared dollars.  Had
we got such a person and was it true?  Chap wasn't very
senior and didn't know about Universal.  Told him to have
a word with the Commissioner and we got an apology this
morning about the same time as your secretary found an
envelope containing ten thousand dollars in your mail!
Pretty sly of your man, wasn't it?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond smiled.  Typical of Goldfinger to have thought of a
way of getting him into trouble over the dollars.  Probably
made the call to Scotland Yard directly after the game.
He had wanted to show Bond that if you gave Goldfinger
a knock you'd get at least a thorn in your hand.  But the
Universal Export cover seemed to have stuck.  Bond said,
'That's pretty hot!  The twister!  You might tell the
managing director that this time it goes to the White
Cross.  Can you fix the other things?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Of course.  Call you back in a few minutes.  But watch
your step abroad and call us at once if you get bored and
need company.  So long.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
''Bye.'  Bond put down the receiver.  He got up and set
about packing his bag.  He could see the scene in the Chief
of Staff's office as the conversation was played back off the
tape while the Chief of Staff translated the call to Miss
Moneypenny.  'Says he agrees that Goldfinger is up to
something big but he can't make out what.  G. is flying
this morning with his Rolls from Ferryfield.  007 wants to
follow.  (Let's say two hours later to let G. get well away
on the other side.  Fix the reservation, would you?)  He
wants us to have a word with Customs so that he can take
a good look at the Rolls and plant a Homer in the boot.
(Fix that too, please.)  He'll keep in touch through stations
in case he needs help...'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
And so forth.  It was an efficient machine.  Bond finished
packing and, when the London call came giving him his
various clearances, he went downstairs, paid his bill and
got quickly out of Ramsgate on to the Canterbury road.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
London had said that Goldfinger was booked on a
special flight leaving at twelve.  Bond got to Ferryfield by
eleven, made himself known to the Chief Passport Control
and the Customs officers who were expecting him, had his
car taken out of sight into an empty hangar and sat and
smoked and talked minor shop with the passport men.
They thought he was from Scotland Yard.  He let them
go on thinking it.  No, he said, Goldfinger was all right.
It was possible that one of his servants was trying to
smuggle something out of the country.  Rather confidential.
If Bond could just be left alone with the car for ten minutes?
He wanted to have a look at the tool kit.  Would the
Customs give the rest of the Rolls their Grade A going
over for hidden compartments?  They'd be glad to do so.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
At eleven-forty-five one of the Customs men put his
head round the door.  He winked at Bond.  'Coming in
now.  Chauffeur on board.  Going to ask both to board the
plane before the car.  Tell them it's something to do with
the weight distribution.  Not so phoney as it sounds.  We
know this old crate.  She's armour-plated.  Weighs about
three tons.  Call you when we're ready.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Thanks.'  The room emptied.  Bond took the fragile
little parcel out of his pocket.  It contained a dry-cell
battery wired to a small vacuum tube.  He ran his eye
over the wiring and put the apparatus back in his coat
pocket and waited.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
At eleven-fifty-five the door opened.  The officer
beckoned.  'No trouble.  They're on the plane.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The huge gleaming Silver Ghost stood in the Customs
bay out of sight of the plane.  The only other car was a
dove-grey Triumph TR3 convertible with its hood down.
Bond went to the back of the Rolls.  The Customs men had
unscrewed the plate of the spare tool compartment.  Bond
pulled out the tray of tools and made a show of minutely
examining them and the tray.  He knelt down.  Under
cover of rummaging at the sides of the compartment, he
slipped the battery and tube into the back of it.  He
replaced the tool tray.  It fitted all right.  He stood up and
brushed his hands together.  'Negative,' he said to the
Customs officer.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The officer fitted the plate on and screwed it down with
the square key.  He stood up.  'Nothing funny about the
chassis or the bodywork.  Plenty of room in the frame and
upholstery but we couldn't get at them without doing a
major job.  All right to go?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes, and thanks.'  Bond walked back into the office.
He heard the quick solid whine of the old self-starter.  A
minute later, the car came out of the bay and idled
superbly over to the loading ramp.  Bond stood at the back
of the office and watched it being eased up the ramp.  The
big jaws of the Bristol Freighter clanged shut.  The chocks
were jerked away and the dispatcher raised a thumb.  The
two engines coughed heavily and fired and the great silver
dragonfly trundled off towards the runway.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
When the plane was on the runway, Bond walked round
to his car and climbed into the driver's seat.  He pressed a
switch under the dash.  There was a moment's silence, then
a loud harsh howl came from the hidden loud-speaker.
Bond turned a knob.  The howl diminished to a deep drone.
Bond waited until he heard the Bristol take off.  As the
plane rose and made for the coast the drone diminished.
In five minutes it had gone.  Bond tuned the set and picked
it up again.  He followed it for five minutes as the plane
made off across the Channel and then switched the set
off.  He motored round to the Customs bay, told the
A.A. that he would be back at one-thirty for the two o'clock
flight, and drove slowly off towards a pub he knew in Rye.
From now on, so long as he kept within about a hundred
miles of the Rolls, the Homer, the rough radio transmitter
he had slipped into its tool compartment, would keep
contact with Bond's receiver.  All he had to do was watch
the decibels and not allow the noise to fade.  It was a
simple form of direction finding which allowed one car to
put a 'long tail' on another and keep in touch without
any danger of being spotted.  On the other side of the
Channel, Bond would have to discover the road Goldfinger
had taken out of Le Touquet, get well within range
and close up near big towns or wherever there was a
major fork or crossroads.  Sometimes Bond would make
a wrong decision and have to do some fast motoring to
catch up again.  The D.B.III would look after that.  It
was going to be fun playing hare and hounds across Europe.
The sun was shining out of a clear sky.  Bond felt a
moment's sharp thrill down his spine.  He smiled to
himself, a hard, cold, cruel smile.  Goldfinger, he thought,
for the first time in your life you're in trouble—bad
trouble.
</p>

<p class="calibre4"><br class="calibre1"/></p>

<p class="calibre4">
There is always an <i class="calibre3">agent cycliste</i> at the dangerous
crossroads where Le Touquet's quiet N38 meets the oily
turbulence of the major N1.  Yes, certainly he had seen
the Rolls.  One could not fail to remark it.  A real
aristocrat of a car.  To the right, monsieur, towards
Abbeville.  He will be an hour ahead, but with that <i class="calibre3">bolide</i> of
yours...!
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
As soon as Bond had cleared his papers at the airport,
the Homer had picked up the drone of the Rolls.  But it
was impossible to tell if Goldfinger was heading
north—for the Low Countries or Austria or Germany—or if he
was off to the south.  For that sort of fix you needed two
radio cars to get a bearing.  Bond raised a hand to the
agent and gave his engine the gun.  He would have to
close up fast.  Goldfinger would be through Abbeville and
would already have taken the major fork on to N1 for
Paris or N28 for Rouen.  A lot of time and distance would
be wasted if Bond made the wrong guess.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond swept along the badly cambered road.  He took no
chances but covered the forty-three kilometres to Abbeville
in a quarter of an hour.  The drone of the Homer was
loud.  Goldfinger couldn't be more than twenty miles
ahead.  But which way at the fork?  On a guess Bond took
the Paris road.  He beat the car along.  For a time there
was little change in the voice of the Homer.  Bond could be
right or wrong.  Then, imperceptibly, the drone began to
fade.  Blast!  Turn back or press on fast and take one of the
secondary roads across to Rouen and catch up with him
there?  Bond hated turning back.  Ten kilometres short of
Beauvais he turned right.  For a time it was bad going but
then he was on to the fast N30 and could afford to drift
into Rouen, led on by the beckoning voice of his pick-up.
He stopped on the outskirts of the town and listened with
one ear while consulting his Michelin.  By the waxing
drone he could tell that he had got ahead of Goldfinger.
But now there was another vital fork, not quite so easy to
retrieve if Bond guessed wrong again.  Either Goldfinger
would take the Alençon-Le Mans-Tours route to the
south, or he meant to move south-east, missing Paris, by
way of Evreux, Chartres and Orleans.  Bond couldn't
afford to get closer to the centre of Rouen and perhaps
catch a glimpse of the Rolls and of the way it would
take.  He would have to wait until the Homer went on the
wane and then make his own guess.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
It was a quarter of an hour later before Bond could be
sure that the Rolls was well past.  This time he again took
the left leg of the fork.  He thrust the pedal into the floor and
hurried.  Yes.  This time the drone was merging into a
howl.  Bond was on the track.  He slowed to forty, tuned
down his receiver to a whisper and idled along, wondering
where Goldfinger was heading for.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Five o'clock, six, seven.  The sun set in Bond's driving
mirror and still the Rolls sped on.  They were through
Dreux and Chartres and on to the long straight fifty-mile
stretch into Orleans.  If that was to be the night stop the
Rolls wouldn't have done badly at all—over two hundred
and fifty miles in something over six hours.  Goldfinger was
certainly no slouch when it came to motoring.  He must be
keeping the old Silver Ghost at maximum outside the
towns.  Bond began to close up.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There were rear-lights ahead—dim ones.  Bond had
his fog lights on.  He switched on the Marchals.  It was
some little sports car.  Bond closed up.  M.G.?  Triumph?
Austin Healey?  It was a pale grey Triumph two-seater
with the hood up.  Bond blinked his lights and swept past.
Now there was the glare of another car ahead.  Bond
dowsed his headlamps and drove on the fogs.  The other
car was a mile down the road.  Bond crept up on it.  At a
quarter of a mile, he flashed the Marchals on and off for
a quick look.  Yes, it was the Rolls.  Bond dropped back to a
mile and stayed there, vaguely noticing the dim lights of
the TR3 in his mirror.  On the outskirts of Orleans, Bond
pulled into the side of the road.  The Triumph growled
casually past.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond had never cared for Orleans.  It was a priest and
myth ridden town without charm or gaiety.  It was content
to live off Joan of Arc and give the visitor a hard, holy
glare while it took his money.  Bond consulted his Michelin.
Goldfinger would stop at five-star hotels and eat fillets
of sole and roast chicken.  It would be the Arcades for
him—perhaps the Moderne.  Bond would have liked to stay
outside the town and sleep on the banks of the Loire in the
excellent Auberge de la Montespan, his belly full of
<i class="calibre3">quenelles de brochet</i>.  He would have to stick closer to his
fox.  He decided on the Hôtel de la Gare and dinner at the
station buffet.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
When in doubt, Bond always chose the station hotels.
They were adequate, there was plenty of room to park the
car and it was better than even chances that the Buffet de
la Gare would be excellent.  And at the station one could
hear the heart-beat of the town.  The night-sounds of the
trains were full of its tragedy and romance.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The drone on the receiver had stayed constant for ten
minutes.  Bond noted his way to the three hotels and
cautiously crept into the town.  He went down to the river
and along the lighted <i class="calibre3">quais</i>.  He had been right.  The Rolls
was outside the Arcades.  Bond turned back into the town
and made for the station.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The Hôtel de la Gare was all he had expected—cheap,
old-fashioned, solidly comfortable.  Bond had a hot bath,
went back to his car to make sure the Rolls hadn't moved,
and walked into the station restaurant and ate one of his
favourite meals—two <i class="calibre3">oeufs cocotte à la crème</i>, a large <i class="calibre3">sole
meunière</i> (Orleans was close enough to the sea.  The fish of
the Loire are inclined to be muddy) and an adequate
Camembert.  He drank a well-iced pint of Rose d'Anjou
and had a Hennessy's Three Star with his coffee.  At
ten-thirty he left the restaurant, checked on the Rolls and
walked the virtuous streets for an hour.  One more check
on the Rolls and bed.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
At six o'clock the next morning the Rolls hadn't moved.
Bond paid his bill, had a <i class="calibre3">café complet</i>—with a double
ration of coffee—at the station, motored down to the
<i class="calibre3">quais</i> and backed his car up a side street.  This time he
could not afford to make a mistake.  Goldfinger would
either cross the river and head south to join N7 for the
Riviera, or he would follow the north bank of the Loire,
also perhaps for the Riviera, but also on the route for
Switzerland and Italy.  Bond got out of the car and
lounged against the parapet of the river wall, watching
between the trunks of the plane trees.  At eight-thirty, two
small figures came out of the Arcades.  The Rolls moved
off.  Bond watched it follow the <i class="calibre3">quais</i> until it was out of
sight, then he got behind the wheel of the Aston Martin
and set off in pursuit.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond motored comfortably along the Loire in the early
summer sunshine.  This was one of his favourite corners of
the world.  In May, with the fruit trees burning white and
the soft wide river still big with the winter rains, the valley
was green and young and dressed for love.  He was thinking
this when, before Châteauneuf, there was a shrill scream
from twin Bosch horns and the little Triumph tore past.
The hood was down.  There was the blur of a pretty face
hidden by white motoring goggles with dark blue lenses.
Although Bond only saw the edge of a profile—a slash of
red mouth and the fluttering edge of black hair under a
pink handkerchief with white spots, he knew she was
pretty from the way she held her head.  There was the
authority of someone who is used to being admired,
combined with the self-consciousness of a girl driving alone and
passing a man in a smart car.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond thought: That <i class="calibre3">would</i> happen today!  The Loire is
dressed for just that—chasing that girl until you run her
to ground at lunch-time, the contact at the empty restaurant
by the river, out in the garden under the vine trellis.
The <i class="calibre3">friture</i> and the ice-cold Vouvray, the cautious sniffing
at each other and then the two cars motoring on in convoy
until that evening, well down to the south, there would be
the place they had agreed on at lunch—olive trees,
crickets singing in the indigo dusk, the discovery that they
liked each other and that their destinations could wait.
Then, next day ('No, not tonight.  I don't know you well
enough, and besides I'm tired') they would leave her car
in the hotel garage and go off in his at a tangent, slowly,
knowing there was no hurry for anything, driving to the
west, away from the big roads.  What was that place he
had always wanted to go to, simply because of the name?
Yes, Entre Deux Seins, a village near Les Baux.  Perhaps
there wasn't even an inn there.  Well, then they would go
on to Les Baux itself, at the Bouches du Rhóne on the edge
of the Camargue.  There they would take adjoining rooms
(not a double room, it would be too early for that) in the
fabulous Baumanière, the only hotel-restaurant in France
with Michelin's supreme accolade.  They would eat the
<i class="calibre3">gratin de langouste</i> and perhaps, because it was traditional
on such a night, drink champagne.  And then...
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond smiled at his story and at the dots that ended it.
Not today.  Today you're working.  Today is for Goldfinger,
not for love.  Today the only scent you may smell is
Goldfinger's expensive after-shave lotion, not ... what
would she use?  English girls made mistakes about scent.
He hoped it would be something slight and clean.
Balmain's Vent Vert perhaps, or Caron's Muguet.  Bond
tuned up his receiver for reassurance, then hushed it and
motored on, relaxed, playing with his thoughts of the girl,
filling in the details.  Of course he might meet up with her
again.  They seemed to be keeping pretty close company.
She must have spent the night in Orleans.  Where?  What a
waste.  But wait a minute!  Suddenly Bond woke up from
his day-dreaming.  The open hood reminded him.  He'd
seen that Triumph before.  It had been at Ferryfield, must
have taken the flight after Goldfinger.  It was true he
hadn't seen the girl or noted the registration number, but
surely it was the same.  If so, for her to be still on
Goldfinger's tail after three hundred miles was more than
coincidence.  And she had been driving with dimmed
lights the night before!  Here, what's going on?
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond stepped on the accelerator.  He was approaching
Nevers.  He'd anyway have to close up for the next big
turning.  He would kill two birds with one stone and also
see what the girl was up to.  If she was keeping station
somewhere between him and Goldfinger there would have
to be some furious thinking.  And it would be a blasted
nuisance.  It was hard enough keeping up with Goldfinger.
With another tail sandwiched between them, it would
become hellish difficult.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
She was still there, perhaps two miles behind the Rolls,
keeping well back.  As soon as he caught sight of her little
glittering rump (as he described it to himself) Bond
slowed.  Well, well!  Who <i class="calibre3">was</i> she?  What the hell was all
this about?  Bond motored on, his face morose and
thoughtful.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The little convoy kept on, still following the wide black
sheen of N7 that runs like a thick, dangerous nerve down
through the heart of France.  But at Moulins Bond nearly
lost the scent.  He had to double back quickly and get on
to N73.  Goldfinger had turned at right angles and was now
making for Lyons and Italy, or for Mâcon and Geneva.
Bond had to do some fast motoring and then was only just
in time to avoid running into trouble.  He had not worried
much about the pitch of the Homer.  He had counted on a
sight of the Triumph to slow him down.  Suddenly he
realized that the drone was becoming a howl.  If he hadn't
braked hard down from the ninety he was doing, he
would have been on top of the Rolls.  As it was, he was
barely creeping along when he came over a rise and saw
the big yellow car stopped by the wayside a mile ahead.
There was a blessed cart-track.  Bond swerved into it and
stopped under cover of standing corn.  He took a small
pair of binoculars out of the glove compartment, got out
of the car and walked back.  Yes, damn it!  Goldfinger
was sitting below a small bridge on the bank of a stream.
He was wearing a white dust coat and white linen driving
helmet in the style of German tourists.  He was eating,
having a picnic.  The sight made Bond hungry.  What
about his own lunch?  He examined the Rolls.  Through the
rear window he could see part of the Korean's black
shape in the front seat.  There was no sign of the Triumph.
If the girl had still been on Goldfinger's tail she would
have had no warning.  She would have just kept her head
down and stepped on the gas.  Now she would be somewhere
ahead, waiting in ambush for the Rolls to come by.
Or would she?  Perhaps Bond's imagination had run away
with him.  She was probably on her way to the Italian
lakes to join an aunt, some friends, a lover.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Now Goldfinger was on his feet.  Tidy man.  That's right,
pick up the scraps of paper and tuck them away carefully
under the bridge.  Why not throw them in the stream?
Suddenly Bond's jaws tightened.  What did those actions
of Goldfinger remind him of?  Was Bond romancing again,
or was the bridge a post box?  Had Goldfinger been
instructed to leave something, one of his bars of gold, under
this particular bridge?  France, Switzerland, Italy.  It was
convenient for all of them—the Communist cell in Lyons
for instance, one of the strongest in France.  And this was a
good place to use with a clear field of view up and down
the road.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger scrambled up the bank.  Bond drew back
under cover.  He heard the distant grind of the old
self-starter.  He cautiously watched the Rolls until it had
disappeared.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
It was a pretty bridge over a pretty stream.  It had a
survey number set in the arch—79/6—the sixth bridge
from some town on N79.  Easy to find.  Bond got quickly
out of the car and slid down the shallow bank.  It was dark
and cool under the arch.  There were the shadows of fish
in the slow, clear, pebbled water.  Bond searched the edge
of the masonry near the grass verge.  Exactly in the centre,
below the road, there was a patch of thick grass against
the wall.  Bond parted the grass.  There was a sprinkling of
freshly turned earth.  Bond dug with his fingers.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There was only one.  It was smooth to the touch and
brick-shaped.  It needed some strength to lift it.  Bond
brushed the earth off the dull yellow metal and wrapped
the heavy bar in his handkerchief.  He held the bar
under his coat and climbed back up the bank on to the
empty road.
</p>

<p class="calibre4"><br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/></p>

<h3 class="calibre8">
CHAPTER THIRTEEN
<br class="calibre6"/>
'IF YOU TOUCH ME THERE...'
</h3>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond felt pleased with himself.  A whole lot of people
were going to get very angry with Goldfinger.  You
can do a lot of dirty work with twenty thousand
pounds.  Now plans would have to be altered, conspiracies
postponed, perhaps even lives saved.  And, if it ever got to
an inquiry by SMERSH, which was unlikely as they were the
sort of realistic people who cut their losses, it could only be
assumed that some sheltering tramp had found the gold bar.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond lifted the secret flap under the passenger seat and
slipped the bar inside.  Dangerous stuff.  He would have to
contact the next station of the Service and hand it over
to them.  They would get it back to London in the Embassy
bag.  Bond would have to report this quickly.  It confirmed
a lot.  M might even want to warn the Deuxième and have
the bridge watched to see who came.  But Bond hoped
that would not happen.  He didn't want a scare started
just when he was getting closer to Goldfinger.  He wanted
the skies over Goldfinger to be blue and clear.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond got moving.  Now there were other things to think
about.  He must catch up with the Rolls before Mâcon and
get the next fork, to Geneva or Lyons, right.  He must solve
the problem of the girl and if possible get her off the road.
Pretty or not, she was confusing the issue.  And he must
stop and buy himself something to eat and drink.  It was
one o'clock and the sight of Goldfinger eating had made
him hungry.  And it was time to fill up and check the water
and oil.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The drone of the Homer grew louder.  He was in the
outskirts of Mâcon.  He must close up and take the risk
of being spotted.  The busy traffic would hide his low-slung
car.  It was vital to know if the Rolls crossed the Saône
for the Bourg road or if it turned right at the bridge and
joined the N6 for Lyons.  Far down the Rue Rambuteau
there was a glimpse of yellow.  Over the railway bridge and
through the little square.  The high yellow box kept on
towards the river.  Bond watched the passers-by turn their
heads to follow the gleaming Rolls.  The river.  Would
Goldfinger turn right or keep on across the bridge?  The
Rolls kept straight on.  So it was Switzerland!  Bond
followed over into the suburb of St Laurent.  Now for a
butcher and a baker and a wine shop.  A hundred yards
ahead the golden head of a calf hung over the pavement.
Bond glanced in his driving mirror.  Well, well!  The little
Triumph was only feet away from his tail.  How long had
she been there?  Bond had been so intent on following the
Rolls that he hadn't glanced back since entering the
town.  She must have been hiding up a side street.  So!  Now
coincidence was certainly out.  Something must be done.
Sorry, sweetheart.  I've got to mess you up.  I'll be as
gentle as I can.  Hold tight.  Bond stopped abruptly in
front of the butcher's shop.  He banged the gears into
reverse.  There was a sickening scrunch and tinkle.  Bond
switched off his engine and got out.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
He walked round to the back of the car.  The girl, her
face tense with anger, had one beautiful silken leg on the
road.  There was an indiscreet glimpse of white thigh.  The
girl stripped off her goggles and stood, legs braced and
arms akimbo.  The beautiful mouth was taut with anger.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The Aston Martin's rear bumper was locked into the
wreckage of the Triumph's lamps and radiator grille.
Bond said amiably, 'If you touch me there again you'll have
to marry me.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The words were hardly out of his mouth before the open
palm cracked across his face.  Bond put up a hand and
rubbed his cheek.  Now there was quite a crowd.  There
was a murmur of approval and ribaldry.  'Allez y la gosse!
Maintenant le knock-out!'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The girl's rage had not dissipated with the blow.  'You
bloody fool!  What the hell do you think you're doing?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond thought: If only pretty girls were always angry
they would be beautiful.  He said, 'Your brakes can't be up
to much.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'<i class="calibre3">My</i> brakes!  What the hell do you mean?  You reversed
into me.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Gears slipped.  I didn't know you were so close.'  It was
time to calm her down.  'I'm most frightfully sorry.  I'll pay
for all the repairs and everything.  It really is bad luck.
Let's see what the damage is.  Try and back away.
Doesn't look as if our bumpers have over-ridden.'  Bond
put a foot on the Triumph's bumpers and rocked.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Don't you dare touch my car!  Leave it alone.'  Angrily
the girl climbed back into the driver's seat.  She pressed
the self-starter.  The engine fired.  Metal clanged under the
bonnet.  She switched off and leant out.  'There you are,
you idiot!  You've smashed the fan.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond had hoped he had.  He got into his own car and
eased it away from the Triumph.  Bits of the Triumph,
released by Bond's bumper, tinkled on to the road.  He got
out again.  The crowd had thinned.  There was a man in a
mechanic's overalls.  He volunteered to call a breakdown
van and went off to do so.  Bond walked over to the
Triumph.  The girl had got out and was waiting for him.
Her expression had changed.  Now she was more composed.
Bond noticed that her eyes, which were dark blue, watched
his face carefully.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said, 'It really won't be too bad.  Probably knocked
the fan out of alignment.  They'll put temporary headlamps
in the sockets and straighten up the chrome.  You'll
be off again by tomorrow morning.  Now,' Bond reached
into his pocket for his notecase, 'this is maddening for you
and I'll certainly take all the blame.  Here's a hundred
thousand francs to cover the damage and your expenses
for the night and telephoning your friends and so on.
Please take it and call it quits.  I'd love to stay here and
see you get on the road all right tomorrow morning.  But
I've got an appointment this evening and I've simply got
to make it.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'No.'  The one word was cool, definite.  The girl put her
hands behind her back and waited.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'But...'  What was it she wanted, the police?  Have him
charged with dangerous driving?
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I've got an appointment this evening too.  I've got to
make it.  I've got to get to Geneva.  Will you please take
me there?  It's not far.  Only about a hundred miles.  We
could do it in two hours in that.'  She gestured at the
D.B.III.  'Will you?  Please?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There was a desperate urgency in the voice.  No cajolery,
no threats, only a blazing need.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
For the first time Bond examined her as more than a
pretty girl who perhaps—they were the only explanations
Bond had found to fit the facts—wanted to be picked up
by Goldfinger or had a blackmail on him.  But she didn't
look capable of either of these things.  There was too much
character in the face, too much candour.  And she wasn't
wearing the uniform of a seductress.  She wore a white,
rather masculine cut, heavy silk shirt.  It was open at the
neck, but it would button up to a narrow military collar.
The shirt had long wide sleeves gathered at the wrists.
The girl's nails were unpainted and her only piece of
jewellery was a gold ring on her engagement finger (true
or false?).  She wore a very wide black stitched leather belt
with double brass buckles.  It rose at the back to give
some of the support of a racing driver's corset belt.  Her
short skirt was charcoal-grey and pleated.  Her shoes were
expensive-looking black sandals which would be
comfortable and cool for driving.  The only touch of colour
was the pink handkerchief which she had taken off her
head and now held by her side with the white goggles.  It
all looked very attractive.  But the get-up reminded Bond
more of an equipment than a young girl's dress.  There
was something faintly mannish and open-air about the
whole of her behaviour and appearance.  She might, thought
Bond, be a member of the English women's ski team, or
spend a lot of her time in England hunting or show-jumping.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Although she was a very beautiful girl she was the kind
who leaves her beauty alone.  She had made no attempt to
pat her hair into place.  As a result, it looked as a girl's
hair should look—untidy, with bits that strayed and a
rather crooked parting.  It provided the contrast of an
uneven, jagged dark frame for the pale symmetry of the
face, the main features of which were blue eyes under dark
brows, a desirable mouth, and an air of determination and
independence that came from the high cheek-bones and
the fine line of the jaw.  There was the same air of
self-reliance in her figure.  She held her body proudly—her
fine breasts out-thrown and unashamed under the taut
silk.  Her stance, with feet slightly parted and hands behind
her back, was a mixture of provocation and challenge.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The whole picture seemed to say, 'Now then, you
handsome bastard, don't think you can "little woman" me.
You've got me into this mess and, by God, you're going
to get me out!  You may be attractive, but I've got my
life to run, and I know where I'm going.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond weighed her request.  How much of a nuisance
would she be?  How soon could he get rid of her and get on
with his business?  Was there any security risk?  Against the
disadvantages, there was his curiosity about her and what
she was up to, the memory of the fable he had spun round
her and which had now taken its first step towards
realization, and, finally, the damsel-in-distress
business—any woman's appeal for help.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said curtly, 'I'll be glad to take you to Geneva.
Now then,' he opened up the back of the Aston Martin,
'let's get your things in.  While I fix up about the garage
here's some money.  Please buy us lunch—anything you
like for yourself.  For me, six inches of Lyon sausage, a
loaf of bread, butter, and half a litre of Mâcon with the
cork pulled.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Their eyes met and exchanged a flurry of masculine/feminine
master/slave signals.  The girl took the money.
'Thank you.  I'll get the same things for myself.'  She went
to the boot of the Triumph and unlocked it.  'No, don't
bother.  I can manage these.'  She hauled out a bag of golf
clubs with the cover zipped shut and a small, expensive-looking
suitcase.  She brought them over to the Aston
Martin and, rejecting Bond's offer of help, fitted them in
alongside Bond's suitcase.  She watched him lock the back
of the car and went back to the Triumph.  She took out a
wide, black-stitched leather shoulder bag.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said, 'What name and address shall I give?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'What?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond repeated his question, wondering if she would lie
about the name or the address, or both.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
She said, 'I shall be moving about.  Better say the
Bergues at Geneva.  The name's Soames.  Miss Tilly
Soames.'  There was no hesitation.  She went into the
butcher's shop.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
A quarter of an hour later they were on their way.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The girl sat upright and kept her eyes on the road.  The
drone on the Homer was faint.  The Rolls must have gained
fifty miles.  Bond hurried.  They flashed through Bourg
and over the river at Pont d'Ain.  Now they were in the
foothills of the Jura and there were the S-bends of N84.
Bond went at them as if he was competing in the Alpine
Trials.  After the girl had swayed against him twice she
kept her hand on the handle on the dash and rode with
the car as if she were his spare driver.  Once, after a
particularly sharp dry skid that almost took them over the
side, Bond glanced at her profile.  Her lips were parted and
her nostrils slightly flared.  The eyes were alight.  She was
enjoying herself.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
They came to the top of the pass and there was the run
down towards the Swiss frontier.  Now the Homer was
sending out a steady howl.  Bond thought, I must take it
easy or we shall be running into them at the Customs.  He
put his hand under the dash and tuned the noise down.
He pulled in to the side of the road.  They sat in the car
and ate a polite but almost silent picnic, neither making
any attempt at conversation, both, it seemed, with other
things on their minds.  After ten minutes, Bond got going
again.  He sat relaxed, motoring easily down the curving
road through the young whispering pines.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The girl said, 'What's that noise?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Magneto whine.  Gets worse when I hurry.  Started at
Orleans.  Have to get it fixed tonight.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
She seemed satisfied with this mumbo-jumbo.  She said
diffidently, 'Where are you heading for?  I hope I haven't
taken you very far out of your way.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said in a friendly voice, 'Not at all.  As a matter of
fact, I'm going to Geneva too.  But I may not stop there
tonight.  May have to get on.  Depends on my meeting.
How long will you be there?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I don't know.  I'm playing golf.  There's the Swiss
Women's Open Championship at Divonne.  I'm not
really that class, but I thought it would be good for me
to try.  Then I was going to play on some of the other
courses.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Fair enough.  No reason why it shouldn't be true.  But
Bond was certain it wasn't the whole truth.  He said, 'Do
you play a lot of golf?  What's your home course?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Quite a lot.  Temple.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
It had been an obvious question.  Was the answer true,
or just the first golf course she had thought of?  'Do you
live near there?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I've got an aunt who lives at Henley.  What are you
doing in Switzerland.  Holiday?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Business.  Import and Export.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Oh.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond smiled to himself.  It was a stage conversation.
The voices were polite stage voices.  He could see the
scene, beloved of the English theatre—the drawing-room,
sunshine on hollyhocks outside french windows, the couple
sitting on the sofa, on the edge of it, she pouring out the
tea.  'Do you take sugar?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
They came out into the foothills.  There was a long
straight stretch of road and in the distance the small
group of buildings of the French Customs.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The girl gave him no chance to get a glimpse of her
passport.  As soon as the car stopped she said something
about tidying up and disappeared into the 'Dames'.  Bond
had gone through the Controle and was dealing with the
triptyque when she reappeared, her passport stamped.  At
the Swiss Customs she chose the excuse of getting
something out of her suitcase.  Bond hadn't got time to hang
about and call her bluff.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond hurried on into Geneva and pulled up at the
imposing entrance of the Bergues.  The <i class="calibre3">baggagiste</i> took
her suitcase and golf clubs.  They stood together on the
steps.  She held out her hand.  'Goodbye.'  There was no
melting of the candid blue eyes.  'And thank you.  You
drive beautifully.'  Her mouth smiled.  'I'm surprised you
got into the wrong gear at Mâcon.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond shrugged.  'It doesn't often happen.  I'm glad I did.
If I can get my business finished, perhaps we could meet
again.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'That would be nice.'  The tone of voice said it wouldn't
be.  The girl turned and went in through the swing-doors.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond ran down to his car.  To hell with her!  Now to
pick up Goldfinger.  Then to the little office on the Quai
Wilson.  He tuned the Homer and waited a couple of
minutes.  Goldfinger was close, but moving away.  He
could either be following the right or the left bank of the
lake.  From the pitch of the Homer, he was at least a mile
outside the town.  Which way?  To the left towards
Lausanne?  To the right towards Evian?  The D.B.III
was already on the left-hand road.  Bond decided to follow
its nose.  He got moving.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond caught up with the high yellow silhouette just
before Coppet, the tiny lakeside hamlet made famous by
Madame de Staël.  He hid behind a lorry.  At his next
reconnaissance the Rolls had disappeared.  Bond motored
on, watching to the left.  At the entrance to the village, big
solid iron gates were closing in a high wall.  Dust hung in
the air.  Above the wall was a modest placard.  It said, in
faded yellow on blue, ENTREPRISES AURIC A.G.  The fox had
gone to earth!
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond went on until he found a turning to the left.  He
followed this until there was a lane which led back through
the vineyards to the woods behind Coppet and to the
chateau of Madame de Staël.  Bond stopped among the
trees.  Now he should be directly above the Entreprises
Auric.  He took his binoculars, got out and followed a
foot-path down towards the village.  Soon, on his right,
was a spiked iron railing.  There was rolled barbed wire
along its top.  A hundred yards lower down the hill the
railing merged into a high stone wall.  Bond walked slowly
back up the path looking for the secret entrance the
children of Coppet would have made to get at the chestnut
trees.  He found it—two bars of the railing widened to
allow a small body through.  Bond stood on the lower
railing with all his weight, widened the gap by another
couple of inches and wormed his way through.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond walked warily through the trees, watching each
step for dead branches.  The trees thinned.  There were
glimpses of a huddle of low buildings behind a small
<i class="calibre3">manoir</i>.  Bond picked the thick trunk of a fir tree and got
behind it.  Now he was looking down on the buildings.
The nearest was about a hundred yards away.  There was
an open courtyard.  In the middle of the courtyard stood
the dusty Silver Ghost.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond took out the binoculars and examined everything
minutely.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The house was a well-proportioned square block of old
red brick with a slate roof.  It consisted of two storeys
and an attic floor.  It would probably contain four
bedrooms and two principal rooms.  The walls were partly
covered by a very old wistaria in full bloom.  It was an
attractive house.  In his mind's eye Bond could see the
white-painted panelling inside.  He smelled the sweet
musty sunshiny smell of the rooms.  The back door gave on
to the wide paved courtyard in which stood the Rolls.
The courtyard was open on Bond's side but closed on the
other two sides by single-storey corrugated iron workshops.
A tall zinc chimney rose from the angle of the two
workshops.  The chimney was topped by a zinc cowl.  On top of
the zinc cowl was the revolving square mouth of what
looked to Bond like a Decca Navigator—the radar
scanner you see on the bridges of most ships.  The
apparatus whirled steadily round.  Bond couldn't imagine what
purpose it served on the roof of this little factory among
the trees.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Suddenly the silence and immobility of the peaceful
scene were broken.  It was as if Bond had put a penny in
the slot of a diorama on Brighton pier.  Somewhere a tinny
clock struck five.  At the signal, the back door of the house
opened and Goldfinger came out, still dressed in his white
linen motoring coat, but without the helmet.  He was
followed by a nondescript, obsequious little man with a
tooth-brush moustache and horn-rimmed spectacles.
Goldfinger looked pleased.  He went up to the Rolls and
patted its bonnet.  The other man laughed politely.  He
took a whistle out of his waistcoat pocket and blew it.  A
door in the right-hand workshop opened and four workmen
in blue overalls filed out and walked over to the car.
From the open door they had left there came a whirring
noise and a heavy engine started up and settled into the
rhythmic pant Bond remembered from Reculver.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The four men disposed themselves round the car.  At a
word from the little man, who was presumably the
foreman, they began to take the car to pieces.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
By the time they had lifted the four doors off their
hinges, removed the bonnet cover from the engine and had
set about the rivets on one of the mudguards, it was clear
that they were methodically stripping the car of its
armour plating.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Almost as soon as Bond had come to this conclusion, the
black, bowler-hatted figure of Oddjob appeared at the
back door of the house and made some sort of a noise at
Goldfinger.  With a word to the foreman, Goldfinger went
indoors and left the workmen to it.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
It was time for Bond to get going.  He took a last careful
look round to fix the geography in his mind and edged
back among the trees.
</p>

<p class="calibre4"><br class="calibre1"/></p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I am from Universal Export.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Oh yes?'  Behind the desk there was a reproduction of
the Annigoni portrait of the Queen.  On the other walls
were advertisements for Ferguson tractors and other
agricultural machinery.  From outside the wide window
came the hum of traffic along the Quai Wilson.  A steamer
hooted.  Bond glanced out of the window and watched it
ride across the middle distance.  It left an enchanted wake
across the flawless evening mirror of the lake.  Bond looked
back into the politely inquiring eyes in the bland, neutral,
businessman's face.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'We were hoping to do business with you.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'What sort of business?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Important business.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The man's face broke into a smile.  He said cheerfully,
'It's 007, isn't it?  Thought I recognized you.  Well now,
what can I do for you?'  The voice became cautious.  'Only
one thing, better make it quick and get along.  There's
been the hell of a heat on since the Dumont business.
They've got me taped—the locals and Redland.  All very
peaceful of course, but you won't want them sniffing
round you.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I thought it might be like that.  It's only routine.  Here,'
Bond unbuttoned his shirt and took out the heavy chunk
of gold.  'Get that back, would you?  And transmit this
when you have a chance.'  The man pulled a pad towards
him and wrote in shorthand to Bond's dictation.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
When the man had finished he put the pad in his pocket.
'Well, well!  Pretty hot stuff.  Wilco.  My routine's at
midnight.  This'—he indicated the gold—'can go to Berne
for the bag.  Anything else?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Ever heard of the "Entreprises Auric" at Coppet?
Know what they do?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I know what every engineering business in the area
does.  Have to.  Tried to sell them some hand riveters last
year.  They make metal furniture.  Pretty good stuff.  The
Swiss railways take some of it, and the airlines.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Know which airlines?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The man shrugged.  'I heard they did all the work for
Mecca, the big charter line to India.  Their terminus is
Geneva.  They're quite a big competitor with All-India.
Mecca's privately owned.  Matter of fact, I did hear that
Auric &amp; Co. had some money in it.  No wonder they've
got the contract for the seating.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
A slow, grim smile spread across Bond's face.  He got
up and held out his hand.  'You don't know it, but you've
just done a whole jigsaw puzzle in under a minute.  Many
thanks.  Best of luck with the tractor business.  Hope we'll
meet again one day.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Out in the street, Bond got quickly into his car and
drove along the <i class="calibre3">quai</i> to the Bergues.  So that was the
picture!  For two days he'd been trailing a Silver Ghost
across Europe.  It was an armour-plated Silver Ghost.
He'd watched the last bit of plating being riveted on in
Kent, and the whole lot being stripped off at Coppet.
Those sheets would already be in the furnaces at Coppet,
ready to be modelled into seventy chairs for a Mecca
Constellation.  In a few days' time those chairs would be
stripped off the plane in India and replaced with
aluminium ones.  And Goldfinger would have made what?  Half
a million pounds?  A million?
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
For the Silver Ghost wasn't silver at all.  It was a Golden
Ghost—all the two tons of its bodywork.  Solid,
eighteen-carat, white gold.
</p>

<h3 class="calibre8">
CHAPTER FOURTEEN
<br class="calibre6"/>
THINGS THAT GO THUMP IN THE NIGHT
</h3>

<p class="calibre4">
James booked in at the Hôtel des Bergues, took
a bath and shower and changed his clothes.  He
weighed the Walther PPK in his hand and wondered
whether he should take it or leave it behind.  He decided
to leave it.  He had no intention of being seen when he went
back to the Entreprises Auric.  If, by dreadful luck, he was
seen, it would spoil everything to get into a fight.  He had
his story, a poor one, but at least one that would not break
his cover.  He would have to rely on that.  But Bond did
choose a particular pair of shoes that were rather heavier
than one could expect from their casual build.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
At the desk he asked if Miss Soames was in.  He was not
surprised when the receptionist said they had no Miss
Soames staying in the hotel.  The only question was
whether she had left the hotel when Bond was out of sight
or had registered under another name.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond motored across the beautiful Pont du Mont Blanc
and along the brightly lit <i class="calibre3">quai</i> to the Bavaria, a modest
Alsatian brasserie that had been the rendezvous of the
great in the days of the League of Nations.  He sat by the
window and drank Enzian washed down with pale Löwenbrau.
He thought first about Goldfinger.  There was now
no doubt what he was up to.  He financed a spy network,
probably SMERSH, and he made fortunes smuggling gold to
India, the country where he could get the biggest premium.
After the loss of his Brixham trawler, he had thought out
this new way.  He first made it known that he had an
armoured car.  That would only be considered eccentric.
Many English bodybuilders exported them.  They used
to go to Indian rajahs; now they went to oil sheiks and
South American presidents.  Goldfinger had chosen a
Silver Ghost because, with his modifications, the chassis
was strong enough, the riveting was already a feature of the
bodywork, and there was the largest possible area of metal
sheeting.  Perhaps Goldfinger had run it abroad once or
twice to get Ferryfield used to it.  Then, on the next trip, he
took off the armour plating in his works at Reculver.  He
substituted eighteen-carat white gold.  Its alloy of nickel
and silver would be strong enough.  The colour of the
metal would not betray him if he got in a smash or if the
bodywork were scratched.  Then off to Switzerland and to
the little factory.  The workmen would have been as
carefully picked as the ones at Reculver.  They would take
off the plates and mould them into aircraft seats which
would then be upholstered and installed in Mecca
Airlines—run presumably by some stooge of Goldfinger's
who got a cut on each 'gold run'.  On these runs—once,
twice, three times a year?—the plane would accept only
light freight and a few passengers.  At Bombay or Calcutta
the plane would need an overhaul, be re-equipped.  It
would go to the Mecca hangar and have new seats fitted.
The old ones, the gold ones, would go to the bullion
brokers.  Goldfinger would get his sterling credit in Nassau
or wherever he chose.  He would have made his hundred,
or two hundred, per cent profit and could start the cycle
all over again, from the 'We Buy Old Gold' shops in
Britain to Reculver—Geneva—Bombay.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Yes, thought Bond, gazing out across the glistening,
starlit lake, that's how it would be—a top-notch
smuggling circuit with a minimum risk and maximum profit.
How Goldfinger must smile as he pressed the bulb of the
old boa-constrictor horn and swept past the admiring
policemen of three countries!  He certainly seemed to
have the answer—the philosopher's stone, the finger of
gold!  If he hadn't been such an unpleasant man, if he
wasn't doing all this to sustain the trigger finger of
SMERSH, Bond would have felt admiration for this
monumental trickster whose operations were so big that they
worried even the Bank of England.  As it was, Bond only
wanted to destroy Goldfinger, seize his gold, get him
behind bars.  Goldfinger's gold-lust was too strong, too
ruthless, too dangerous to be allowed the run of the
world.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
It was eight o'clock.  The Enzian, the firewater distilled
from gentian that is responsible for Switzerland's chronic
alcoholism, was beginning to warm Bond's stomach and
melt his tensions.  He ordered another double and with it a
choucroute and a carafe of Fondant.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
And what about the girl, this pretty, authoritarian
joker that had suddenly been faced in the deal?  What in
hell was she about?  What about this golf story?  Bond got
up and went to the telephone booth at the back of the
room.  He got on to the <i class="calibre3">Journal de Genève</i> and through to
the sports editor.  The man was helpful, but surprised at
Bond's question.  No.  The various championships were of
course played in the summer when the other national
programmes were finished and it was possible to lure a
good foreign entry to Switzerland.  It was the same with all
other European countries.  They liked to bring in as many
British and American players as possible.  It increased the
gates.  'Pas de quoi, monsieur.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond went back to his table and ate his dinner.  So much
for that.  Whoever she was, she was an amateur.  No
professional would use a cover that could be broken down
by one telephone call.  It had been in the back of Bond's
mind—reluctantly, because he liked the girl and was
excited by her—that she could, she just could have been
an agent of SMERSH sent to keep an eye on Goldfinger, or
Bond or both.  She had some of the qualities of a secret
agent, the independence, the strength of character, the
ability to walk alone.  But that idea was out.  She hadn't
got the training.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond ordered a slice of gruyère, pumpernickel and
coffee.  No, she was an enigma.  Bond only prayed that
she hadn't got some private plot involving either him or
Goldfinger that was going to mess up his own operation.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
And his own job was so nearly finished!  All he needed
was the evidence of his own eyes that the story he had
woven round Goldfinger and the Rolls was the truth.  One
look into the works at Coppet—one grain of white gold
dust—and he could be off to Berne that very night and be
on to the duty officer over the Embassy scrambler.  Then,
quietly, discreetly, the Bank of England would freeze
Goldfinger's accounts all over the world and perhaps,
already tomorrow, the Special Branch of the Swiss police
would be knocking on the door of Entreprises Auric.
Extradition would follow, Goldfinger would go to Brixton,
there would be a quiet, rather complicated case in one of
the smuggling courts like Maidstone or Lewes.  Goldfinger
would get a few years, his naturalization would be revoked
and his gold hoard, illegally exported, would trickle back
into the vaults below the Bank of England.  And SMERSH
would gnash its blood-stained teeth and add another page
to Bond's bulging zapiska.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Time to go for the last lap.  Bond paid his bill and went
out and got into his car.  He crossed the Rhóne and
motored slowly along the glittering <i class="calibre3">quai</i> through the
evening traffic.  It was an average night for his purpose.  There
was a blazing three-quarter moon to see by, but not a
breath of wind to hide his approach through the woods to
the factory.  Well, there was no hurry.  They would
probably be working through the night.  He would have to take
it very easily and carefully.  The geography of the place and
the route he had plotted for himself ran before Bond's eyes
like a film while the automatic pilot that is in all good
drivers took the car along the wide white highway beside
the sleeping lake.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond followed his route of the afternoon.  When he had
turned off the main road he drove on his sidelights.  He
nosed the car off the lane into a clearing in the woods and
switched off the engine.  He sat and listened.  In the heavy
silence there was only a soft ticking from the hot metal
under the bonnet and the hasty trip of the dashboard
clock.  Bond got out, eased the door shut and walked
softly down the little path through the trees.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Now he could hear the soft heavy pant of the generator
engine ... thumpah ... thumpah ... thumpah.  It seemed
a watchful, rather threatening noise.  Bond reached the
gap in the iron bars, slipped through and stood, straining
his senses forward through the moon-dappled trees.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
THUMPAH ... THUMPAH ... THUMPAH.  The
great iron puffs were on top of him, inside his brain.
Bond felt the skin-crawling tickle at the groin that dates
from one's first game of hide and seek in the dark.  He
smiled to himself at the animal danger signal.  What
primeval chord had been struck by this innocent engine
noise coming out of the tall zinc chimney?  The breath of
a dinosaur in its cave?  Bond tightened his muscles and
crept forward foot by foot, moving small branches carefully
out of his way, placing each step as cautiously as if he
was going through a minefield.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The trees were thinning.  Soon he would be up with the
big sheltering trunk he had used before.  He looked for it
and then stood frozen, his pulse racing.  Below the trunk
of his tree, spreadeagled on the ground, was a body.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond opened his mouth wide and breathed slowly in and
out to release the tension.  Softly he wiped his sweating
palms down his trousers.  He dropped slowly to his hands
and knees and stared forward, his eyes widened like
camera lenses.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The body under the tree moved, shifted cautiously to a
new position.  A breath of wind whispered in the tops of the
trees.  The moonbeams danced quickly across the body and
then were still.  There was a glimpse of thick black hair,
black sweater, narrow black slacks.  And something
else—a straight gleam of metal along the ground.  It began
beneath the clump of black hair and ran past the trunk of
the trees into the grass.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond slowly, wearily bent his head and looked at the
ground between his spread hands.  It was the girl, Tilly.
She was watching the buildings below.  She had a rifle—a
rifle that must have been among the innocent golf clubs—
ready to fire on them.  Damn and blast the silly bitch!
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond slowly relaxed.  It didn't matter who she was or
what she was up to.  He measured the distance, planned
each stride—the trajectory of the final spring, left hand to
her neck, right to the gun.  Now!
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond's chest skidded over the hump of the buttocks and
thudded into the small of the girl's back.  The impact
emptied the breath out of her with a soft grunt.  The
fingers of Bond's left hand flew to the throat and found
the carotid artery.  His right hand was on the waist of the
rifle's stock.  He prised the fingers away, felt that the safety
catch was on and reached the rifle far to one side.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond eased the weight of his chest off the girl's back and
moved his fingers away from her neck.  He closed them
softly over her mouth.  Beneath him, he felt the body heave,
the lungs labouring for breath.  She was still out.  Carefully
Bond gathered the two hands behind the girl's back and
held them with his right.  Beneath him the buttocks began
to squirm.  The legs jerked.  Bond pinned the legs to the
ground with his stomach and thighs, noting the strong
muscles bunched under him.  Now the breath was rasping
through his fingers.  Teeth gnawed at his hand.  Bond
inched carefully forwards along the girl.  He got his mouth
through her hair to her ear.  He whispered urgently, 'Tilly,
for Christ's sake.  Stay still!  This is me, Bond.  I'm a friend.
This is vital.  Something you don't know about.  Will you
stay still and listen?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The teeth stopped reaching for his fingers.  The body
relaxed and lay soft under his.  After a time, the head
nodded once.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond slid off her.  He lay beside her, still holding her
hands prisoned behind her back.  He whispered, 'Get your
breath.  But tell me, were you after Goldfinger?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The pale face glanced sideways and away.  The girl
whispered fiercely into the ground, 'I was going to kill
him.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Some girl Goldfinger had put in the family way.  Bond
let go her hands.  She brought them up and rested her head
on them.  Her whole body shuddered with exhaustion and
released nerves.  The shoulders began to shake softly.  Bond
reached out a hand and smoothed her hair, quietly,
rhythmically.  His eyes carefully went over the peaceful,
unchanged scene below.  Unchanged?  There was something.
The radar thing on the cowl of the chimney.  It
wasn't going round any more.  It had stopped with its
oblong mouth pointing in their direction.  The fact had no
significance for Bond.  Now the girl wasn't crying any more.
Bond nuzzled his mouth close to her ear.  Her hair smelled
of jasmine.  He whispered, 'Don't worry.  I'm after him
too.  And I'm going to damage him far worse than you
could have done.  I've been sent after him by London.
They want him.  What did he do to you?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
She whispered, almost to herself, 'He killed my sister.
You knew her—Jill Masterton.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said fiercely, 'What happened?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'He has a woman once a month.  Jill told me this when
she first took the job.  He hypnotizes them.  Then he—he
paints them gold.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Christ!  Why?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I don't know.  Jill told me he's mad about gold.  I
suppose he sort of thinks he's—that he's sort of possessing
gold.  You know—marrying it.  He gets some Korean
servant to paint them.  The man has to leave their
backbones unpainted.  Jill couldn't explain that.  I found out
it's so they wouldn't die.  If their bodies were completely
covered with gold paint, the pores of the skin wouldn't be
able to breathe.  Then they'd die.  Afterwards, they're
washed down by the Korean with resin or something.
Goldfinger gives them a thousand dollars and sends
them away.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond saw the dreadful Oddjob with his pot of gold
paint, Goldfinger's eyes gloating over the glistening statue,
the fierce possession.  'What happened to Jill?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'She cabled me to come.  She was in an emergency ward
in a hospital in Miami.  Goldfinger had thrown her out.
She was dying.  The doctors didn't know what was the
matter.  She told me what had happened to her—what he
had done to her.  She died the same night.'  The girl's voice
was dry—matter of fact.  'When I got back to England I
went to Train, the skin specialist.  He told me this business
about the pores of the skin.  It had happened to some
cabaret girl who had to pose as a silver statue.  He showed
me details of the case and the autopsy.  Then I knew what
had happened to Jill.  Goldfinger had had her painted all
over.  He had murdered her.  It must have been out of
revenge for—for going with you.'  There was a pause.  The
girl said dully, 'She told me about you.  She—she liked
you.  She told me if ever I met you I was to give you
this ring.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond closed his eyes tight, fighting with a wave of
mental nausea.  More death!  More blood on his hands.
This time, as the result of a careless gesture, a piece of
bravado that had led to twenty-four hours of ecstasy with
a beautiful girl who had taken his fancy and, in the end,
rather more than his fancy.  And this petty sideswipe at
Goldfinger's ego had been returned by Goldfinger a
thousand, a millionfold.  'She left my employ'—the flat
words in the sunshine at Sandwich two days before.  How
Goldfinger must have enjoyed saying that!  Bond's
fingernails dug into the palms of his hands.  By God, he'd pin
this murder on Goldfinger if it was the last act of his life.
As for himself...?  Bond knew the answer.  This death he
would not be able to excuse as being part of his job.  This
death he would have to live with.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The girl was pulling at her finger—at the Claddagh
ring, the entwined hands round the gold heart.  She put
her knuckle to her mouth.  The ring came off.  She held it
up for Bond to take.  The tiny gold circle, silhouetted
against the trunk of the tree, glittered in the moonlight.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The noise in Bond's ear was something between a hiss
and a shrill whistle.  There was a dry, twanging thud.  The
aluminium feathers of the steel arrow trembled like a
humming bird's wings in front of Bond's eyes.  The shaft
of the arrow straightened.  The gold ring tinkled down the
shaft until it reached the bark of the tree.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Slowly, almost incuriously, Bond turned his head.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Ten yards away—half in moonlight, half in shadow—the
black melon-headed figure crouched, its legs widely
straddled in the judo stance.  The left arm, thrust forward
against the glinting semicircle of the bow, was straight as a
duellist's.  The right hand, holding the feathers of the
second arrow, was rigid against the right cheek.  Behind
the head, the taut right elbow lanced back in frozen
suspense.  The silver tip of the second arrow pointed
exactly between the two pale raised profiles.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond breathed the words, 'Don't move an inch.'  Aloud
he said, 'Hullo, Oddjob.  Damned good shot.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Oddjob jerked the tip of the arrow upwards.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond got to his feet, shielding the girl.  He said softly
out of the corner of his mouth, 'He mustn't see the rifle.'  He
said to Oddjob, speaking casually, peaceably, 'Nice
place Mr Goldfinger has here.  Want to have a word with
him sometime.  Perhaps it's a bit late tonight.  You might
tell him I'll be along tomorrow.'  Bond said to the girl,
'Come on, darling.  We've had our walk in the woods.
Time to get back to the hotel.'  He took a step away from
Oddjob towards the fence.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Oddjob stamped his forward foot.  The point of the
second arrow swung to the centre of Bond's stomach.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Oargn.'  Oddjob jerked his head sideways and downwards
towards the house.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Oh, you think he'd like to see us now?  All right.  You
don't think we'll be disturbing him?  Come on, darling.'  Bond
led the way to the left of the tree, away from the
rifle that lay in the shadowed grass.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
As they went slowly down the hill, Bond talked softly
to the girl, briefing her.  'You're my girl friend.  I brought
you out from England.  Seem surprised and interested by
our little adventure.  We're in a tough spot.  Don't try any
tricks.'  Bond jerked back his head.  'This man's a killer.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The girl said angrily, 'If only you hadn't interfered.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Same to you,' said Bond shortly.  He took it back.
'I'm sorry, Tilly.  Didn't mean that.  But I don't think you
could have got away with it.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I had my plans.  I'd have been over the frontier by
midnight.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond didn't answer.  Something had caught his eye.  On
top of the tall chimney, the oblong mouth of the
radar-thing was revolving again.  It was that that had spotted
them—heard them.  It must be some kind of sonic
detector.  What a bag of tricks this man was!  Bond hadn't
meant to underestimate Goldfinger.  Had he managed to
do so—decisively?  Perhaps, if he had had his gun...?  No.
Bond knew that even his split-second draw wouldn't have
beaten the Korean—wouldn't do so now.  There was a
total deadliness about this man.  Whether Bond had been
armed or unarmed, it would have been a man fighting
a tank.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
They reached the courtyard.  As they did so, the back
door of the house opened.  Two more Koreans, who might
have been the servants from Reculver, ran out towards
them through the warm splash of electric light.  They
carried ugly-looking polished sticks.  'Stop!'  Both men
wore the savage, empty grin that men from Station J,
who had been in Japanese prison camps, had described to
Bond.  'We search.  No trouble or...'  The man who had
spoken, cut the air with a whistling lash of his stick.
'Hands up!'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond put his hands slowly up.  He said to the girl,
'Don't react ... whatever they do.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Oddjob came forward and stood, menacingly, watching
the search.  The search was expert.  Bond coldly watched
the hands on the girl, the grinning faces.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Okay.  Come!'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
They were herded through the open door and along a
stone-flagged passage to the narrow entrance hall at the
front of the house.  The house smelled as Bond had
imagined it would—musty and fragrant and summery.  There
were white-panelled doors.  Oddjob knocked on one
of them.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Oddjob opened the door.  They were prodded through.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger sat at a big desk.  It was neatly encumbered
with important-looking papers.  The desk was flanked by
grey metal filing cabinets.  Beside the desk, within reach of
Goldfinger's hand, stood a short-wave wireless set on
a low table.  There was an operator's keyboard and a
machine that ticked busily and looked like a barograph.
Bond guessed that this had something to do with the
detector that had intercepted them.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger wore his purple velvet smoking-jacket over
an open-necked white silk shirt.  The open neck showed a
tuft of orange chest-hair.  He sat very erect in a
high-backed chair.  He hardly glanced at the girl.  The big
china-blue eyes were fixed on Bond.  They showed no
surprise.  They held no expression except a piercing
hardness.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond blustered, 'Look here, Goldfinger.  What the hell's
all this about?  You put the police on to me over that ten
thousand dollars and I got on your tracks with my girl
friend here, Miss Soames.  I've come to find out what the
hell you mean by it.  We climbed the fence—I know it's
trespassing, but I wanted to catch you before you moved
on somewhere else.  Then this ape of yours came along and
damned near killed one of us with his bow and arrow.
Two more of your bloody Koreans held us up and searched
us.  What the hell's going on?  If you can't give me a civil
answer and full apologies I'll put the police on you.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger's flat, hard stare didn't flicker.  He might
not have heard Bond's angry-gentleman's outburst.  The
finely chiselled lips parted.  He said, 'Mr Bond, they have
a saying in Chicago: "Once is happenstance.  Twice is
coincidence.  The third time it's enemy action."  Miami,
Sandwich and now Geneva.  I propose to wring the truth
out of you.'  Goldfinger's eyes slid slowly past Bond's head.
'Oddjob.  The Pressure Room.'
