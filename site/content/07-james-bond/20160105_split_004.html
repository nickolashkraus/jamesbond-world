CHAPTER FIFTEEN
<br class="calibre6"/>
THE PRESSURE ROOM
</h3>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond's reaction was automatic.  There was no reason
behind it.  He took one quick step forward and
hurled himself across the desk at Goldfinger.  His
body, launched in a shallow dive, hit the top of the desk
and ploughed through the litter of papers.  There was a
heavy thud as the top of his head crashed into Goldfinger's
breastbone.  The momentum of the blow rocked Goldfinger
in his chair.  Bond kicked back at the edge of the
desk, got a purchase and rammed forward again.  As the
chair toppled backwards and the two bodies went down
in the splintering woodwork, Bond's fingers got to the
throat and his thumbs went into its base and downwards
with every ounce of his force.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Then the whole house fell on Bond, a baulk of timber
hit him at the base of the neck and he rolled sluggishly
off Goldfinger on to the floor and lay still.
</p>

<p class="calibre4"><br class="calibre1"/></p>

<p class="calibre4">
The vortex of light through which Bond was whirling
slowly flattened into a disc, a yellow moon, and then into
a burning Cyclops eye.  Something was written round the
fiery eyeball.  It was a message, an important message for
him.  He must read it.  Carefully, one by one, Bond spelled
out the tiny letters.  The message said: SOCIÉTÉ ANONYME
MAZDA.  What was its significance?  A hard bolt of water hit
Bond in the face.  The water stung his eyes and filled his
mouth.  He retched desperately and tried to move.  He
couldn't.  His eyes cleared, and his brain.  There was a
throbbing pain at the back of his neck.  He was staring up
into a big enamelled light bowl with one powerful bulb.
He was on some sort of a table and his wrists and ankles
were bound to its edges.  He felt with his fingers.  He felt
polished metal.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
A voice, Goldfinger's voice, flat, uninterested, said,
'Now we can begin.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond turned his head towards the voice.  His eyes were
dazzled by the light.  He squeezed them hard and opened
them.  Goldfinger was sitting in a canvas chair.  He had
taken off his jacket and was in his shirt sleeves.  There
were red marks round the base of his throat.  On a
folding table beside him were various tools and metal
instruments and a control panel.  On the other side of the
table Tilly Masterton sat in another chair.  She was
strapped to it by her wrists and ankles.  She sat bolt
upright as if she was in school.  She looked incredibly
beautiful, but shocked, remote.  Her eyes gazed vacantly at Bond.
She was either drugged or hypnotized.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond turned his head to the right.  A few feet away
stood the Korean.  He still wore his bowler hat but now he
was stripped to the waist.  The yellow skin of his huge
torso glinted with sweat.  There was no hair on it.  The
flat pectoral muscles were as broad as dinner plates and
the stomach was concave below the great arch of the ribs.
The biceps and forearms, also hairless, were as thick as
thighs.  The ten-minutes-to-two oil slicks of the eyes looked
pleased, greedy.  The mouthful of blackish teeth formed an
oblong grin of anticipation.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond raised his head.  The quick look round hurt.  They
were in one of the factory workrooms.  White light blazed
round the iron doors of two electric furnaces.  There were
bluish sheets of metal stacked in wooden frames.  From
somewhere came the whir of a generator.  There was a
distant, muffled sound of hammering, and, behind the
sound, the faraway iron pant of the power plant.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond glanced down the table on which he lay spread-eagled.
He let his head fall back with a sigh.  There was a
narrow slit down the centre of the polished steel table.  At
the far end of the slit, like a foresight framed in the vee of
his parted feet, were the glinting teeth of a circular saw.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond lay and stared up at the little message on the lamp
bulb.  Goldfinger began to speak in a relaxed conversational
voice.  Bond pulled the curtains tight across the
ghastly peep-show of his imagination and listened.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Mr Bond, the word "pain" comes from the Latin
<i class="calibre3">poena</i> meaning "penalty"—that which must be paid.  You
must now pay for the inquisitiveness which your attack
upon me proves, as I suspected, to be inimical.  Curiosity,
as they say, killed the cat.  This time it will have to kill two
cats, for I fear I must also count this girl an enemy.  She
tells me she is staying at the Bergues.  One telephone call
proved that to be false.  Oddjob was sent to where you were
both hidden and recovered her rifle and also a ring which
it happens that I recognize.  Under hypnotism the rest
came out.  This girl came here to kill me.  Perhaps you did
too.  You have both failed.  Now must come the <i class="calibre3">poena</i>.
Mr Bond—' the voice was weary, bored—'I have had
many enemies in my time.  I am very successful and
immensely rich, and riches, if I may inflict another
of my aphorisms upon you, may not make you friends
but they greatly increase the class and variety of your
enemies.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'That's very neatly put.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger ignored the interruption.  'If you were a free
man, with your talent for inquiry, you would be able to
find round the world the relics of those who have wished
me ill, or who have tried to thwart me.  There have, as I
said, been many of these people and you would find, Mr
Bond, that their remains resemble those of hedgehogs
squashed upon the roads in summertime.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Very poetic simile.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'By chance, Mr Bond.  I am a poet in deeds—not often
in words.  I am concerned to arrange my actions in
appropriate and effective patterns.  But that is by the way.  I
wish to convey to you that it was a most evil day for you
when you first crossed my path and, admittedly in a very
minor fashion, thwarted a minuscule project upon which
I was engaged.  On that occasion it was someone else who
suffered the poena that should have been meted out to you.
An eye was taken for the eye, but it was not yours.  You
were lucky and, if you had then found an oracle to consult,
the oracle would have said to you, "Mr Bond, you have
been fortunate.  Keep away from Mr Auric Goldfinger.  He
is a most powerful man.  If Mr Goldfinger wanted to crush
you, he would only have to turn over in his sleep to
do so."'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'You express yourself most vividly.'  Bond turned his
head.  The great brown and orange football of a head was
bent slightly forward.  The round moon-face was bland,
indifferent.  Casually, one hand reached out to the control
panel and pressed down a switch.  There came a slow
metallic growl from the end of the table on which Bond
lay.  It curved quickly up to a harsh whine and then to a
shrill high whistle that was barely audible.  Bond turned his
head wearily away.  How soon could he manage to die?
Was there any way he could hasten death?  A friend of his
had survived the Gestapo.  He had described to Bond how
he had tried to commit suicide by holding his breath.  By
superhuman will-power, after a few minutes without
breathing, unconsciousness had come.  But, with the blackout
of the senses, will and intention had also left the body.
At once reason was forgotten.  The body's instinct to live
manned the pumps and got breath back into the body
again.  But Bond could try it.  There was nothing else to
help him through the pain barrier before the blessing of
death.  For death was the only exit.  He knew he could
never squeal to Goldfinger and live with himself again—even
in the unlikely event that Goldfinger could be bought
off with the truth.  No, he must stick to his thin story and
hope that the others who would now follow him on
Goldfinger's trail would have better luck.  Who would M
choose?  Probably 008, the second killer in the small
section of three.  He was a good man, more careful than
Bond.  M would know that Goldfinger had killed Bond and
he would give 008 licence to kill in return.  258 in Geneva
would put him on to the scent that would end with Bond's
inquiry about the Entreprises Auric.  Yes, fate would catch
up with Goldfinger if Bond could only keep his mouth shut.
If he gave the least clue away, Goldfinger would escape.
That was unthinkable.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Now then, Mr Bond.'  Goldfinger's voice was brisk.
'Enough of these amiabilities.  Sing, as my Chicago
friends put it, and you will die quickly and painlessly.
The girl also.  Sing not, and your death will be one long
scream.  The girl I shall then give to Oddjob, as I did that
cat, for supper.  Which is it to be?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said, 'Don't be a fool, Goldfinger.  I told my
friends at Universal where I was going and why.  The
girl's parents know that she went with me.  I made
inquiries about this factory of yours before we came here.
We shall be traced here very easily.  Universal is powerful.
You will have the police after you within days of our
disappearance.  I will make a deal with you.  Let us go
and nothing more will be heard of the matter.  I will vouch
for the girl.  You are making a stupid mistake.  We are two
perfectly innocent people.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger said in a bored voice, 'I'm afraid you don't
understand, Mr Bond.  Whatever you have managed to
find out about me, which I suspect is very little, can only
be a grain of the truth.  I am engaged upon gigantic
enterprises.  To take the gamble of letting either of you
leave here alive would be quite ludicrous.  It is out of the
question.  As for my being bothered by the police, I shall
be delighted to receive them if they come.  Those of my
Koreans who can speak won't do so—nor will the mouths
of my electric furnaces which will have vaporized you
both and all your belongings at two thousand degrees
Centigrade.  No, Mr Bond, make your choice.  Perhaps I
can encourage you'—there came the noise of a lever
moving across iron teeth.  'The saw is now approaching
your body at about one inch every minute.  Meanwhile,'
he glanced at Oddjob and held up one finger, 'a little
massage from Oddjob.  To begin with, only grade one.
Grades two and three are still more persuasive.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond closed his eyes.  The sickly zoo-smell of Oddjob
enveloped him.  Big, rasping fingers set to work on him
carefully, delicately.  A pressure here, combined with a
pressure there, a sudden squeeze, a pause, and then a
quick, sharp blow.  Always the hard hands were surgically
accurate.  Bond ground his teeth until he thought they
would break.  The sweat of pain began to form pools in the
sockets of his closed eyes.  The shrill whine of the saw was
getting louder.  It reminded Bond of the sawdust-scented
sounds of long ago summer evenings at home in England.
Home?  This was his home, this cocoon of danger he had
chosen to live in.  And here he would be buried 'in some
corner of a foreign blast furnace that is for ever two
thousand degrees Centigrade'.  God rest ye merry gentlemen
of the Secret Service!  What should he give himself as
an epitaph?  What should be his 'famous last words'?
That you have no choice about your birth, but you can
choose the way you die?  Yes, it would look well on a
tombstone—not <i class="calibre3">Savoir vivre</i> but <i class="calibre3">Savoir mourir</i>.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Mr Bond.'  Goldfinger's voice held an ounce of urgency.
'Is this really necessary?  Just tell me the truth.  Who are
you?  Who sent you here?  What do you know?  Then it will
be so easy.  You shall both have a pill.  There will be no
pain.  It will be like taking a sleeping draught.  Otherwise
it will be so messy—so messy and distressing.  And are you
being fair to the girl?  Is this the behaviour of an English
gentleman?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Oddjob's torment had stopped.  Bond turned his head
slowly towards the voice and opened his eyes.  He said,
'Goldfinger, there is nothing more to tell because there is
nothing.  If you will not accept my first bargain I will
make you another.  The girl and I will work for you.
How about that?  We are capable people.  You could put
us to good use.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'And get a knife, two knives in my back?  Thank you
no, Mr Bond.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond decided it was time to stop talking.  It was time to
start winding up the mainspring of will-power that must
not run down again until he was dead.  Bond said politely,
'Then you can go and —— yourself.'  He expelled all the
breath from his lungs and closed his eyes.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Even I am not capable of that, Mr Bond,' said
Goldfinger with good humour.  'And now, since you have
chosen the stony path instead of the smooth, I must extract
what interest I can from your predicament by making the
path as stony as possible.  Oddjob, grade two.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The lever on the table moved across iron teeth.  Now
Bond could feel the wind of the saw between his knees.
The hands came back.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond counted the slowly pounding pulse that utterly
possessed his body.  It was like the huge panting power
plant in the other part of the factory but, in his case, it was
slowly decelerating.  If only it would slow down quicker.
What was this ridiculous will to live that refused to listen
to the brain?  Who was making the engine run on although
the tank was dry of fuel?  But he must empty his mind of
thought, as well as his body of oxygen.  He must become a
vacuum, a deep hole of unconsciousness.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Still the light burned red through his eyelids.  Still he
could feel the bursting pressure in his temples.  Still the
slow drum of life beat in his ears.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
A scream tried to force its way through the clamped teeth.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Die damn you die die damn you die damn you die damn
you die damn you die...
</p>

CHAPTER SIXTEEN
<br class="calibre6"/>
THE LAST AND THE BIGGEST
</h3>

<p class="calibre4">
The wings of a dove, the heavenly choir, Hark the
Herald Angels Sing—what else ought he to
remember about Paradise?  It was all so exactly like
what he had been told in the nursery—this sensation of
flying, the darkness, the drone of a million harps.  He really
must try and remember the dope about the place.  Let's see
now, one got to the Pearly Gates...
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
A deep fatherly voice said, almost in his ear, 'This is
your captain speaking.'  (Well, well.  Who was this.
Saint Peter?)  We are coming in to land now.  Will you
please fasten your seat belts and extinguish your cigarettes.
Thank you.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There must be a whole lot of them, going up together.
Would Tilly be on the same trip?  Bond squirmed with
embarrassment.  How would he introduce her to the
others, to Vesper for instance?  And when it came to the
point, which would he like the best?  But perhaps it would
be a big place with countries and towns.  There was
probably no more reason why he should run into one of
his former girl friends here than there had been on earth.
But still there were a lot of people he'd better avoid until
he got settled in and found out the form.  Perhaps, with so
much love about, these things wouldn't matter.  Perhaps
one just loved all the girls one met.  Hm.  Tricky business!
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
With these unworthy thoughts in his mind, Bond
relapsed into unconsciousness.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The next thing he knew was a gentle sensation of swaying.
He opened his eyes.  The sun blinded them.  He closed
them again.  A voice above and behind his head said,
'Watch it, bud.  That ramp's steeper than it looks.'  Almost
immediately there was a heavy jolt.  A surly voice in front
said, 'Cheesus, you're telling me.  Why in hell can't they
put down rubber.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond thought angrily, that's a fine way to talk up here.
Just because I'm new and they think no one's listening.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There was the bang of a swing door.  Something hit
Bond sharply on a protruding elbow.  He shouted 'Hey!'
and tried to reach his elbow and rub it, but his hands
wouldn't move.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Whaddya know.  Hey, Sam, better call the doc.  This
one's come round.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Sure!  Here, put him alongside the other.'  Bond felt
himself being lowered.  It was cooler now.  He opened his
eyes.  A big round Brooklyn face was bent over his.  The
eyes met his and smiled.  The metal supports of the stretcher
touched the ground.  The man said, 'How ya feelin',
mister?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Where am I?'  Now there was panic in Bond's voice.
He tried to rise but couldn't.  He felt the sweat break out
on his body.  God!  Was this still part of the old life?  At the
thought of it, a wave of grief poured through his body.
Tears burned his eyes and trickled down his cheeks.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Hey, hey!  Take it easy, mister.  You're okay.  This is
Idlewild, New York.  You're in America now.  No more
troubles, see.'  The man straightened up.  He thought Bond
was a refugee from somewhere.  'Sam, get movin'.  This
guy's in shock.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Okay, okay.'  The two voices receded, mumbling
anxiously.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond found he could move his head.  He looked round.
He was in a white-painted ward—presumably something
to do with the health department of the airport.  There
was a row of tidy beds.  Sun poured down from high
windows, but it was cool, air-conditioned.  He was on a
stretcher on the floor.  There was another one next to it.
He strained his head sideways.  It was Tilly.  She was
unconscious.  Her pale face, framed in the black hair,
pointed at the ceiling.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The door at the end of the ward sighed open.  A doctor
in a white coat stood and held it.  Goldfinger, looking
brisk, cheerful, walked swiftly down between the beds.  He
was followed by Oddjob.  Bond wearily closed his eyes.
Christ!  So that was the score.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Feet gathered round his stretcher.  Goldfinger said
breezily, 'Well, they certainly look in good shape, eh,
Doctor?  That's one of the blessings of having enough
money.  When one's friends or one's staff are ill one can
get them the very best medical attention.  Nervous
breakdowns, both of them.  And in the same week!  Would you
believe it?  But I blame myself for working them both too
hard.  Now it's my duty to get them back on their feet
again.  Dr Foch—he's the best man in Geneva, by the
way—was quite definite.  He said, "They need rest, Mr
Goldfinger.  Rest, rest and again rest." He gave them
sedatives and now they're on their way to the Harkness
Pavilion at the Presbyterian.'  Goldfinger chuckled fatly.
'Sow and you shall reap, eh, Doctor?  When I gave the
Harkness a million dollars' worth of X-ray equipment, I
certainly never expected anything back.  But now?  I only
had to put through a call and they've got two fine rooms
waiting for them.  Now then—' there was a rustle of
notes—'thank you for all your help with Immigration.
Fortunately they both had valid visas and I think
Immigration was satisfied that Mr Auric Goldfinger was a
sufficient guarantee that neither of them wants to
overthrow the United States Government by force, what?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes indeed, and thank you Mr Goldfinger.  Anything
I can do ... I understand you have a private ambulance
waiting outside.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond opened his eyes and looked at where the doctor's
voice came from.  He saw a pleasant, serious young man
with rimless glasses and a crew-cut.  Bond said quietly and
with desperate sincerity, 'Doctor, there is absolutely
nothing wrong with me or this girl.  We have been drugged
and brought here against our will.  Neither of us works
or has ever worked for Goldfinger.  I am warning you
that we have been kidnapped.  I demand to see the
Chief of Immigration.  I have friends in Washington
and New York.  They will vouch for me.  I beg of you to
believe me.'  Bond held the man's eyes in his, willing him
to believe.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The doctor looked worried.  He turned to Goldfinger.
Goldfinger shook his head—discreetly so that Bond would
not be insulted.  A surreptitious hand went up and tapped
the side of his head away from Bond.  Goldfinger raised
helpless eyebrows.  'You see what I mean, Doctor?  It's
been like this for days.  Total nervous prostration combined
with persecution mania.  Dr Foch said they often go
together.  It may need weeks at the Harkness.  But I'm
going to pull him round if it's the last thing I do.  It's the
shock of these unfamiliar surroundings.  Perhaps a shot of
intraval sodium...'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The doctor bent to his black bag.  'I guess you're right,
Mr Goldfinger.  So long as Harkness is looking after the
case.'  There came the tinkle of instruments.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger said, 'It's terribly sad to see a man break
down so utterly, a man who has been one of my best
assistants.'  He bent a sweet, fatherly smile on Bond.  There
was a catch in his voice.  'You'll be all right, James.
Just relax and have a nice sleep.  I was afraid the flight
might be too much for you.  Just relax and leave
everything to me.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond felt the swab on his arm.  He heaved.  Against his
will, a shower of curses poured from his lips.  Then he felt
the needle and opened his mouth and screamed and
screamed while the doctor knelt beside him and delicately,
patiently, wiped away the sweat from his forehead.
</p>

<p class="calibre4"><br class="calibre1"/></p>

<p class="calibre4">
Now it was a grey painted box of a room.  There were no
windows.  Light came from a single bowl lamp inset in the
centre of the ceiling.  Round the lamp were concentric
slits in the plaster and there was the neutral smell and
faint hum of air-conditioning.  Bond found he could sit up.
He did so.  He felt drowsy but well.  He suddenly realized
that he was ravenously hungry and thirsty.  When had he
last had a meal?  Two, three days ago?  He put his feet
down on the floor.  He was naked.  He examined his body.
Oddjob had been careful.  There was no sign of damage
save for the group of needle-marks on his right forearm.
He got up, conquering dizziness, and took a few steps in
the room.  He had been lying on a ship's type bunk with
drawers under it.  The only other furniture in the room
was a plain deal table and an upright wooden chair.
Everything was clean, functional, Spartan.  Bond knelt to
the drawers under the bunk and opened them.  They
contained all the contents of his suitcase except his watch
and the gun.  Even the rather heavy shoes he had been
wearing on his expedition to Entreprises Auric were there.
He twisted one of the heels and pulled.  The broad
double-sided knife slid smoothly out of its scabbard in the sole.
With the fingers wrapped round the locked heel it made a
workmanlike stabbing dagger.  Bond verified that the other
shoe held its knife and clicked the heels back into position.
He pulled out some clothes and put them on.  He found his
cigarette case and lighter and lit a cigarette.  There were
two doors of which one had a handle.  He opened this one.
It led into a small, well-appointed bathroom and lavatory.
His washing and shaving things were neatly laid out.
There were a girl's things beside them.  Bond softly opened
the other door into the bathroom.  It was a similar room to
his own.  Tilly Masterton's black hair showed on the
pillow of the bunk.  Bond tiptoed over and looked down.
She was sleeping peacefully, a half-smile on the beautiful
mouth.  Bond went back into the bathroom, softly closed
the door and went to the mirror over the basin and
looked at himself.  The black stubble looked more like
three days than two.  He set to work to clean himself up.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Half an hour later, Bond was sitting on the edge of his
bunk thinking, when the door without a handle opened
abruptly.  Oddjob stood in the entrance.  He looked
incuriously at Bond.  His eyes flickered carefully round the
room.  Bond said sharply, 'Oddjob, I want a lot of food,
quickly.  And a bottle of bourbon, soda and ice.  Also a
carton of Chesterfields, king-size, and either my own
watch or another one as good as mine.  Quick march!
Chop-chop!  And tell Goldfinger I want to see him, but
not until I've had something to eat.  Come on!  Jump to it!
Don't stand there looking inscrutable.  I'm hungry.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Oddjob looked redly at Bond as if wondering which
piece to break.  He opened his mouth, uttered a noise
between an angry bark and a belch, spat drily on the
floor at his feet and stepped back, whirling the door shut.
When the slam should have come, the door decelerated
abruptly and closed with a soft, decisive, double click.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The encounter put Bond in good humour.  For some
reason Goldfinger had decided against killing them.  He
wanted them alive.  Soon Bond would know why he wanted
them alive but, so long as he did, Bond intended to stay
alive on his own terms.  Those terms included putting
Oddjob and any other Korean firmly in his place, which,
in Bond's estimation, was rather lower than apes in the
mammalian hierarchy.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
By the time an excellent meal together with everything
else, including his watch, Bond had asked for, had been
brought by one of the Korean servants, Bond had learned
nothing more about his circumstances except that his
room was close to water and not far from a railway bridge.
Assuming his room was in New York, it was either on the
Hudson or the East River.  The railway was electric and
sounded like a subway, but Bond's New York geography
was not good enough to place it.  His watch had stopped.
When he asked the time he got no answer.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond had eaten all the food on the tray and was
smoking and sipping a solid bourbon and soda when the door
opened.  Goldfinger came in alone.  He was wearing a
regulation businessman's clothes and looked relaxed and
cheerful.  He closed the door behind him and stood with
his back to it.  He looked searchingly at Bond.  Bond
smoked and looked politely back.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger said, 'Good morning, Mr Bond.  I see you
are yourself again.  I hope you prefer being here to being
dead.  So as to save you the trouble of asking a lot of
conventional questions, I will tell you where you are
and what has happened to you.  I will then put to you
a proposition to which I require an unequivocal reply.
You are a more reasonable man than most, so I need only
give you one brief warning.  Do not attempt any dramatics.
Do not attack me with a knife or a fork or that bottle.  If
you do, I shall shoot you with this.'  A small-calibre pistol
grew like a black thumb out of Goldfinger's right fist.  He
put the hand with the gun back in his pocket.  'I very
seldom use these things.  When I have had to, I have never
needed more than one .25-calibre bullet to kill.  I shoot at
the right eye, Mr Bond.  And I never miss.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said, 'Don't worry, I'm not as accurate as that
with a bourbon bottle.'  He hitched up the knee of his
trousers and put one leg across the other.  He sat relaxed.
'Go ahead.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Mr Bond,' Goldfinger's voice was amiable.  'I am an
expert in many other materials beside metals and I have
a keen appreciation of everything that is one thousand
fine, as we say of the purest gold.  In comparison with that
degree of purity, of value, human material is of a very low
grade indeed.  But occasionally one comes across a piece of
this stuff that can at least be put to the lower forms of use.
Oddjob is an example of what I mean—simple, unrefined
clay, capable of limited exploitation.  At the last moment
my hand hesitated to destroy a utensil with the durability
I observed in yourself.  I may have made a mistake in
staying my hand.  In any case I shall take the fullest steps
to protect myself from the consequences of my impulse.  It
was something you said that saved your life.  You suggested
that you and Miss Masterton would work for me.  Normally
I would have no use for either of you, but it just
happens that I am on the brink of a certain enterprise in
which the services of both of you could be of a certain
minimal assistance.  So I took the gamble.  I gave you both
the necessary sedatives.  Your bills were paid and your
things fetched from the Bergues where Miss Masterton
turned out to be registered under her real name.  I sent
a cable in your name to Universal Export.  You had been
offered employment in Canada.  You were flying over to
explore the prospects.  You were taking Miss Masterton
as your secretary.  You would write further details.  A
clumsy cable, but it will serve for the short period I require
your services.  (It won't, thought Bond, unless you
included in the text one of the innocent phrases that would
tell M that the cable was authentic.  By now, the Service
would know he was working under enemy control.
Wheels would be turning very fast indeed.)  And in case
you think, Mr Bond, that my precautions were inadequate,
that you will be traced, let me tell you that I am no longer
in the least interested about your true identity nor the
strength and resources of your employers.  You and Miss
Masterton have utterly disappeared, Mr Bond.  So have I,
so have all my staff.  The airport will refer inquiries to the
Harkness Pavilion at the Presbyterian Hospital.  The
hospital will never have heard of Mr Goldfinger nor of his
patients.  The F.B.I. and the C.I.A. have no record of me,
for I have no criminal history.  No doubt the immigration
authorities will have details of my comings and goings
over the years, but these will not be helpful.  As for my
present whereabouts, and yours, Mr Bond, we are now
in the warehouse of the Hi-speed Trucking Corporation,
a formerly respectable concern which I own through
nominees and which has been equipped, most thoroughly,
as the secret headquarters for the enterprise of which I
spoke.  You and Miss Masterton will be confined to these
quarters.  Here you will live and work and possibly,
though personally I have doubts about Miss Masterton's
inclinations in that respect, make love.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'And what will our work consist of?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Mr Bond—'  For the first time since Bond had known
Goldfinger, the big, bland face, always empty of expression,
showed a trace of life.  A look almost of rapture
illuminated the eyes.  The finely chiselled lips pursed into
a thin, beatic curve.  'Mr Bond, all my life I have been in
love.  I have been in love with gold.  I love its colour, its
brilliance, its divine heaviness.  I love the texture of gold,
that soft sliminess that I have learnt to gauge so accurately
by touch that I can estimate the fineness of a bar to
within one carat.  And I love the warm tang it exudes when
I melt it down into a true golden syrup.  But, above all,
Mr Bond, I love the power that gold alone gives to its
owner—the magic of controlling energy, exacting labour,
fulfilling one's every wish and whim and, when need be,
purchasing bodies, minds, even souls.  Yes, Mr Bond, I
have worked all my life for gold and, in return, gold
has worked for me and for those enterprises that I have
espoused.  I ask you,' Goldfinger gazed earnestly at Bond,
'is there any other substance on earth that so rewards its
owner?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Many people have become rich and powerful without
possessing an ounce of the stuff.  But I see your point.  How
much have you managed to collect and what do you do
with it?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I own about twenty million pounds' worth, about as
much as a small country.  It is now all in New York.  I
keep it where I need it.  My treasure of gold is like a
compost heap.  I move it here and there over the face of
the earth and, wherever I choose to spread it, that corner
blossoms and blooms.  I reap the harvest and move on.  At
this moment I am proposing to encourage, to force, a
certain American enterprise with my golden compost.
Therefore the gold bars are in New York.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'How do you choose these enterprises?  What attracts
you to them?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I espouse any enterprise that will increase my stock of
gold.  I invest, I smuggle, I steal.'  Goldfinger made a
small gesture of the hands, opening the palms persuasively.
'If you will follow the simile, regard history as a train
speeding along through time.  Birds and animals are
disturbed by the noise and tumult of the train's passage, they
fly away from it or run fearfully or cower, thinking they
hide.  I am like the hawk that follows the train—you have
no doubt seen them doing this, in Greece for instance—ready
to pounce on anything that may be flushed by the
train's passage, by the passage of history.  To give you a
simple example: the progress of history produces a man
who invents penicillin.  At the same time, history creates a
world war.  Many people are dying or afraid of dying.
Penicillin will save them.  Through bribery at certain
military establishments on the Continent, I obtain stocks
of penicillin.  I water these down with some harmless
powder or liquid and sell them at immense profit to those
who crave the stuff.  You see what I mean, Mr Bond?
You have to wait for the prey, watch it carefully and
then pounce.  But, as I say, I do not search out such
enterprises.  I allow the train of history to flush them
towards me.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'What's the latest one?  What have Miss Masterton and
I got to do with it?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'The latest one, Mr Bond, is the last one.  It is also the
biggest.'  Goldfinger's eyes were now blank, focused
inwards.  His voice became low, almost reverential at what
he saw.  'Man has climbed Everest and he has scraped the
depths of the ocean.  He has fired rockets into outer space
and split the atom.  He has invented, devised, created in
every realm of human endeavour, and everywhere he has
triumphed, broken records, achieved miracles.  I said in
every realm, but there is one that has been neglected, Mr
Bond.  That one is the human activity loosely known as
crime.  The so-called criminal exploits committed by
individual humans—I do not of course refer to their
idiotic wars, their clumsy destruction of each other—are
of miserable dimensions: little bank robberies, tiny
swindles, picayune forgeries.  And yet, ready to hand, a
few hundred miles from here, opportunity for the greatest
crime in history stands waiting.  The stage is set, the
gigantic prize is offered.  Only the actors are missing.  But
the producer is at last here, Mr Bond'—Goldfinger raised
a finger and tapped his chest—'and he has chosen his
cast.  This very afternoon the script will be read to the
leading actors.  Then rehearsals will begin and, in one
week, the curtain will go up for the single, the unique
performance.  And then will come the applause, the
applause for the greatest extra-legal coup of all time.
And, Mr Bond, the world will rock with that applause for
centuries.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Now a dull fire burned in Goldfinger's big pale eyes and
there was a touch of extra colour in his red-brown cheeks.
But he was still calm, relaxed, profoundly convinced.
There's no trace here, reflected Bond, of the madman, the
visionary.  Goldfinger had some fantastic exploit in mind,
but he had gauged the odds and knew they were right.
Bond said, 'Well, come on.  What is it, and what do we
have to do about it?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'It is a robbery, Mr Bond.  A robbery against no opposition,
but one that will need detailed execution.  There will
be much paper-work, many administrative details to
supervise.  I was going to do this myself until you offered
your services.  Now you will do it, with Miss Masterton as
your secretary.  You have already been partly remunerated
for this work with your life.  When the operation is
successfully completed you will receive one million pounds in
gold.  Miss Masterton will receive half a million.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said enthusiastically, 'Now you're talking.  What
are we going to do?  Rob the end of the rainbow?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes,' Goldfinger nodded.  'That is exactly what we are
going to do.  We are going to burgle fifteen billion dollars'
worth of gold bullion, approximately half the supply of
mined gold in the world.  We are going, Mr Bond, to take
Fort Knox.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4"><br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/></p>

<p class="calibre4"><a id="chap17"></a></p>

<h3 class="calibre8">
CHAPTER SEVENTEEN
<br class="calibre6"/>
HOODS' CONGRESS
</h3>

<p class="calibre4">
'Fort Knox.'  Bond shook his head seriously.  'Isn't
that rather a tall order for two men and a girl?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger shrugged impatiently.  'Please put
away your sense of humour for one week, Mr Bond.  Then
laugh as much as you please.  I shall have under my
command approximately one hundred men and women.  These
people will be hand picked from the six most powerful
gangster groups in the United States.  This force will
amount to the toughest and most compact fighting unit
that has ever been assembled in peace time.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'All right.  How many men guard the vault at Fort Knox?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger slowly shook his head.  He knocked once on
the door behind him.  The door flicked open.  Oddjob
stood on the threshold, crouching, alert.  When he saw
that the meeting was still peaceful he straightened himself
and waited.  Goldfinger said, 'You will have many
questions to ask, Mr Bond.  They will all be answered this
afternoon.  Beginning at two-thirty.  It is now exactly
twelve o'clock.'  Bond glanced at his watch and adjusted it.
'You and Miss Masterton will attend the meeting at
which the proposition will be put to the heads of the
six organizations I have mentioned.  No doubt these
people will ask the same questions as occur to you.
Everything will be explained.  Afterwards you will settle down
to detailed work with Miss Masterton.  Ask for what you
want.  Oddjob will see to your welfare and also be on
permanent guard.  Do not be obstreperous or you will
instantly be killed.  And do not waste time trying to escape
or to contact the outside world.  I have hired your services
and I shall require every ounce of them.  Is that a bargain?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said drily, 'I've always wanted to be a millionaire.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger didn't look at him.  He looked at his fingernails.
Then he gave Bond one last hard glance and went
out and shut the door behind him.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond sat and gazed at the closed door.  He brusquely
ran both hands through his hair and down over his face.
He said 'Well, well' aloud to the empty room, got up and
walked through the bathroom to the girl's bedroom.  He
knocked on the door.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Who is it?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Me.  Are you visible?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes.'  The voice was unenthusiastic.  'Come in.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
She was sitting on the edge of the bed, pulling on a
shoe.  She was wearing the things Bond had first seen
her in.  She looked cool and collected and unsurprised by
her surroundings.  She looked up at Bond.  Her eyes were
aloof, disdainful.  She said coldly, precisely, 'You've got us
into this.  Get us out.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said amiably, 'I may be able to.  I got us out of our
graves.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'After getting us into them.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond looked thoughtfully at the girl.  He decided it would
be ungallant to spank her, so to speak, on an empty
stomach.  He said, 'This won't get us anywhere.  We're in
this together, whether we like it or not.  What do you want
for breakfast or lunch?  It's a quarter past twelve.  I've eaten.
I'll order yours and then come back and tell you the
score.  There's only one way out of here and Oddjob, that
Korean ape, is guarding it.  Now then, breakfast or lunch?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
She unbent an inch.  'Thank you.  Scrambled eggs and
coffee, please.  And toast and marmalade.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Cigarettes?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'No, thank you.  I don't smoke.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond went back to his room and knocked on the door.
It opened an inch.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said, 'All right, Oddjob.  I'm not going to kill
you yet.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The door opened farther.  Oddjob's face was impassive.
Bond gave the order.  The door closed.  Bond poured
himself a bourbon and soda.  He sat on the edge of the bed and
wondered how he was going to get the girl on his side.
From the beginning she had resented him.  Was that only
because of her sister?  Why had Goldfinger made that cryptic
remark about her 'inclinations'?  What was there about her
that he himself felt—something withdrawn, inimical.  She
was beautiful—physically desirable.  But there was a cold,
hard centre to her that Bond couldn't understand or define.
Oh well, the main thing was to get her to go along.
Otherwise life in prison would be intolerable.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond went back into her room.  He left both doors open
so that he could hear.  She was still sitting on the bed
wrapped in a coiled immobility.  She watched Bond
carefully.  Bond leaned against the jamb of the door.  He took a
long pull at his whisky.  He said, looking her in the eye,
'You'd better know that I'm from Scotland Yard'—the
euphemism would serve.  'We're after this man Goldfinger.
He doesn't mind.  He thinks no one can find us for
at least a week.  He's probably right.  He saved our lives
because he wants us to work for him on a crime.  It's big
business.  Pretty scatter-brained.  But there's a lot of
planning and paperwork.  We've got to look after that side.
Can you do shorthand and typing?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes.'  Her eyes were alight.  'What's the crime?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond told her.  He said, 'Of course it all sounds ridiculous
and I daresay a few questions and answers will show
these gangsters, if they don't show Goldfinger, that the
whole thing's impossible.  But I don't know.  Goldfinger's
an extraordinary man.  From what I know about him, he
never moves unless the odds are right.  And I don't think
he's mad—at least not madder than other kinds of
geniuses—scientists and so on.  And there's no doubt he's
a genius in his particular field.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'So what are you going to do about it?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond lowered his voice.  He said, 'What are <i class="calibre3">we</i> going to
do about it, you mean.  <i class="calibre3">We</i> are going to play along.  And to
the hilt.  No shirking and no funny business.  We're going
to be greedy for the money and we're going to give him
absolutely top-notch service.  Apart from saving our lives,
which mean less than nothing to him, it's the only hope
we, or rather I because that's my line of country, can have
of a chance to queer his pitch.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'How are you going to do that?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I haven't the faintest idea.  Something may turn up.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'And you expect me to go along with you?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Why not?  Any other suggestions?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
She pursed her lips obstinately.  'Why should I do what
you say?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond sighed.  'There's no point in being a suffragette
about this.  It's either that or get yourself killed after
breakfast.  It's up to you.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The mouth turned down with distaste.  She shrugged
her shoulders.  She said ungraciously, 'Oh, all right
then.'  Suddenly her eyes flared.  'Only don't ever touch me or I
shall kill you.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There came the click of Bond's bedroom door.  Bond
looked mildly down at Tilly Masterton.  'The challenge
is attractive.  But don't worry.  I won't take it up.'  He
turned and strolled out of the room.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
One of the Koreans passed him carrying the girl's
breakfast.  In his room another Korean had brought in a
typist's desk and chair and a Remington portable.  He
arranged them in the corner away from the bed.  Oddjob
was standing in the doorway.  He held out a sheet of paper.
Bond went up to him and took it.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
It was a foolscap memo sheet.  The writing, with a ball
point, was neat, careful, legible, undistinguished.  It said:

<p class="calibre4"><br class="calibre1"/></p>

<p class="calibre4">
At the end of this was written, 'You and Miss Masterton
will be fetched at 2.20.  Both will be prepared to take notes.
Formal dress, please.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond smiled.  The Koreans left the room.  He sat down
at the desk, slipped paper and carbons into the typewriter
and set to.  At least he would show the girl that he
was prepared to do his stint.  Gosh, what a crew!  Even the
Mafia had come in.  How had Goldfinger persuaded them
all to come?  And who in heaven's name was Miss Pussy
Galore?
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond had the copies finished by two o'clock.  He went
into the girl's room and gave them to her together with
a shorthand notebook and pencils.  He also read her
Goldfinger's note.  He said, 'You'd better get these names
in your head.  They probably won't be hard to identify.
We can ask if we get stuck.  I'll go and get into my formal
dress.'  He smiled at her.  'Twenty minutes to go.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
She nodded.
</p>

<p class="calibre4"><br class="calibre1"/></p>

<p class="calibre4">
Walking down the corridor behind Oddjob, Bond could
hear the sounds of the river—the slapping of water on the
piles below the warehouse, the long mournful hoot of a
ferry clearing her way, the distant thump of diesels.
Somewhere beneath his feet a truck started up, revved
and then growled away presumably towards the West
Side Highway.  They must be on the top tier of the
long two-tiered building.  The grey paint in the corridor
smelled new.  There were no side doors.  Light came from
bowls in the ceiling.  They reached the end.  Oddjob
knocked.  There was the sound of a Yale key being
turned and two lots of bolts being pulled and they
walked through and into a large bright sunlit room.  The
room was over the end of the warehouse and a wide
picture window, filling most of the facing wall, framed the
river and the distant brown muddle of Jersey City.  The
room had been dressed for the conference.  Goldfinger sat
with his back to the window at a large round table with a
green baize cloth, carafes of water, yellow scratch-pads
and pencils.  There were nine comfortable armchairs
and on the scratch-pads in front of six of them were small
oblong white parcels sealed with red wax.  To the right,
against the wall, was a long buffet table gleaming with
silver and cut glass.  Champagne stood in silver coolers and
there was a row of other bottles.  Among the various foods
Bond noticed two round five-pound tins of Beluga caviar
and several terrines of foie gras.  On the wall opposite the
buffet hung a blackboard above a table on which there
were papers and one large oblong carton.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger watched them come towards him across the
thick wine-red carpet.  He gestured to the chair on his left
for Tilly Masterton and to the one on the right for Bond.
They sat down.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'The agenda?'  Goldfinger took the copies, read the top
one and handed them back to the girl.  He gave a circular
wave of the hand and she got up and distributed the copies
round the table.  He put his hand beneath the table and
pressed a hidden bell.  The door at the back of the room
opened.  One of the Koreans came in and stood waiting.
'Is everything ready?'  The man nodded.  'You understand
that no one is to come into this room but the people on
your list?  Good.  Some of them, perhaps all, will bring a
companion.  The companions will remain in the anteroom.
See that they have everything they wish.  The cards are
there and the dice?  Oddjob.'  Goldfinger glanced up at the
Korean who had remained behind Bond's chair.  'Go
and take up your position.  What is the signal?'  Oddjob
held up two fingers.  'Right.  Two rings on the bell.  You
may go.  See that all the staff carry out their duties to
perfection.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said casually, 'How many staff have you got?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Twenty.  Ten Koreans and ten Germans.  They are all
excellent men, hand picked.  Much goes on in this building.
It is like below-decks in a man-of-war.'  Goldfinger
laid his hands flat on the table in front of him.  'And now,
your duties.  Miss Masterton, you will take notes of any
practical points that arise, anything that is likely to require
action by me.  Do not bother with the argument and
chatter.  Right?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond was glad to see that Tilly Masterton now
looked bright and businesslike.  She nodded briskly,
'Certainly.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'And, Mr Bond, I shall be interested in any reactions
you may have to the speakers.  I know a great deal about
all these people.  In their own territories they are
paramount chiefs.  They are only here because I have bribed
them to come.  They know nothing of me and I need to
persuade them that I know what I am talking about and
will lead them to success.  Greed will do the rest.  But there
may be one or more who wish to back out.  They will
probably reveal themselves.  In their cases I have made
special arrangements.  But there may be doubtful ones.
During the talk, you will scribble with your pencil on this
agenda.  Casually you will note with a plus or a minus sign
opposite the names whether you consider each one for or
against the project.  I shall be able to see what sign you
have made.  Your views may be useful.  And do not forget,
Mr Bond, that one traitor among them, one backslider,
and we could quickly find ourselves either dead or in
prison for life.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Who is this Pussy Galore from Harlem?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'She is the only woman who runs a gang in America.
It is a gang of women.  I shall need some women for this
operation.  She is entirely reliable.  She was a trapeze
artiste.  She had a team.  It was called "Pussy Galore and
her Abrocats".'  Goldfinger did not smile.  'The team was
unsuccessful, so she trained them as burglars, cat burglars.
It grew into a gang of outstanding ruthlessness.  It is a
Lesbian organization which now calls itself "The Cement
Mixers".  Even the big American gangs respect them.  She
is a remarkable woman.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
A buzzer sounded very softly beneath the table.  Goldfinger
straightened himself.  The door at the end of the
room opened briskly and five men came in.  Goldfinger
rose in his chair and ducked his head in welcome.  He said,
'My name is Gold.  Will you please be seated.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There was a careful murmur.  Silently the men closed
round the table, pulled out chairs and sat down.  Five pairs
of eyes looked coldly, warily at Goldfinger.  Goldfinger sat
down.  He said quietly, 'Gentlemen, in the parcels before
you you will find one twenty-four-carat gold bar, value
fifteen thousand dollars.  I thank you for the courtesy of
your attendance.  The agenda is self-explanatory.  Perhaps,
while we wait for Miss Galore, I could run through your
names for the information of my secretaries, Mr Bond
here, and Miss Masterton.  No notes will be made of this
meeting, except on action you may wish me to take, and I
can assure you there are no microphones.  Now then, Mr
Bond, on your right is Mr Jed Midnight of the Shadow
Syndicate operating out of Miami and Havana.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Midnight was a big, good-living man with a jovial
face but slow careful eyes.  He wore a light blue tropical
suit over a white silk shirt ornamented with small green
palm trees.  The complicated gold watch on his wrist must
have weighed nearly half a pound.  He smiled tautly at
Bond and said, 'Howdo.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Then we have Mr Billy Ring who controls the famous
Chicago "Machine".'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond thought he had never seen anyone who was less of
a 'Billy'.  It was a face out of a nightmare and, as the face
turned towards Bond, it knew it was, and watched Bond
for his reactions.  It was a pale, pear-shaped, baby face
with downy skin and a soft thatch of straw-coloured hair,
but the eyes, which should have been pale blue, were a
tawny brown.  The whites showed all round the pupils and
gave a mesmeric quality to the hard thoughtful stare,
unsoftened by a tic in the right eyelid which made the
right eye wink with the heart-beat.  At some early stage in
Mr Ring's career someone had cut off Mr Ring's lower
lip—perhaps he had talked too much—and this had given
him a permanent false smile like the grin of a Hallowe'en
pumpkin.  He was about forty years old.  Bond summed
him up as a merciless killer.  Bond smiled cheerfully into
the hard stare of Mr Ring's left eye and looked past him
at the man Goldfinger introduced as Mr Helmut Springer
of the Detroit Purple Gang.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Springer had the glazed eyes of someone who is
either very rich or very dead.  The eyes were pale blue
opaque glass marbles which briefly recognized Bond and
then turned inwards again in complete absorption with
self.  The rest of Mr Springer was a 'man of
distinction'—casually pin-striped, Hathaway-shirted, Aqua-Velva'd.
He gave the impression of someone who found himself
in the wrong company—a first-class ticket holder in a
third-class compartment, a man from the stalls who has
been shown by mistake to a seat in the pit.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Midnight put his hand up to his mouth and said softly
for Bond's benefit, 'Don't be taken in by the Duke.  My
friend Helmut was the man who put the piquéd shirt
on the hood.  Daughter goes to Vassar, but it's protection
money that pays for her hockey-sticks.'  Bond nodded
his thanks.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'And Mr Solo of the Unione Siciliano.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Solo had a dark heavy face, gloomy with the
knowledge of much guilt and many sins.  His thick
horn-rimmed spectacles helioed briefly in Bond's direction and
then bent again to the business of cleaning Mr Solo's
nails with a pocket knife.  He was a big, chunky man,
half boxer, half head waiter, and it was quite impossible
to tell what was on his mind or where his strength lay.
But there is only one head of the Mafia in America and, if
Mr Solo had the job, thought Bond, he had got it by
strength out of terror.  It would be by the exercise of both
that he kept it.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Howdy.'  Mr Jack Strap of the Spangled Mob had
the synthetic charm of a front man for the Las Vegas
casinos, but Bond guessed he had inherited from the late
lamented brothers Spang thanks to other qualities.  He was
an expansive, showily dressed man of about fifty.  He
was coming to the end of a cigar.  He smoked it as if he
was eating it, munching hungrily.  From time to time he
turned his head sideways and discreetly spat a scrap of it
out on to the carpet behind him.  Behind this compulsive
smoking there would be a lot of tension.  Mr Strap had
quick conjuror's eyes.  He seemed to know that his eyes
frightened people because now, presumably not wanting
to frighten Bond, he gave them charm by crinkling them
at the corners.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The door at the back of the room opened.  A woman in a
black masculine-cut suit with a high coffee-coloured lace
jabot stood in the doorway.  She walked slowly,
unself-consciously down the room and stood behind the empty
chair.  Goldfinger had got to his feet.  She examined him
carefully and then ran her eyes round the table.  She said a
collective, bored 'Hi' and sat down.  Mr Strap said 'Hi
Pussy,' and the others, except Mr Springer who merely
bowed, made careful sounds of welcome.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger said, 'Good afternoon, Miss Galore.  We
have just been through the formality of introductions.  The
agenda is before you, together with the fifteen-thousand-dollar
gold bar I asked you to accept to meet the expense
and inconvenience of attending this meeting.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Miss Galore reached for her parcel and opened it.
She weighed the gleaming yellow brick in her hand.  She
gave Goldfinger a direct, suspicious look.  'All the way
through?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'All the way through.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Miss Galore held his eyes.  She said 'Pardon my asking'
with the curt tone of a hard woman shopper at the sales.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond liked the look of her.  He felt the sexual challenge
all beautiful Lesbians have for men.  He was amused by the
uncompromising attitude that said to Goldfinger and to
the room, 'All men are bastards and cheats.  Don't try any
masculine hocus on me.  I don't go for it.  I'm in a separate
league.'  Bond thought she would be in her early thirties.
She had pale, Rupert Brooke good looks with high
cheekbones and a beautiful jawline.  She had the only violet
eyes Bond had ever seen.  They were the true deep violet
of a pansy and they looked candidly out at the world
from beneath straight black brows.  Her hair, which was
as black as Tilly Masterton's, was worn in an untidy
urchin cut.  The mouth was a decisive slash of deep
vermilion.  Bond thought she was superb and so, he
noticed, did Tilly Masterton who was gazing at Miss
Galore with worshipping eyes and lips that yearned.
Bond decided that all was now clear to him about Tilly
Masterton.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger said, 'And now I must introduce myself.  My
name is not Gold.  My credentials are as follows.  By various
operations, most of them illegitimate, I have made a large
sum of money in twenty years.  That sum now stands at
sixty million dollars.'  (A respectful hm-ing went round the
table.)  'My operations have, for the most part, been
confined to Europe, but you may be interested to know
that I founded and subsequently disposed of the "Golden
Poppy Distributors" who operated out of Hongkong.'  (Mr
Jack Strap whistled softly.)  'The "Happy Landings Travel
Agency", which some of you may have employed in
emergency, was organized and owned by me until I
disbanded it.'  (Mr Helmut Springer screwed a rimless
monocle into one glazed eye so that he could examine
Goldfinger more closely.)  'I mention these minor concerns
to show you that, although you may not know me, I have,
in the past, acted at many removes on, I believe, all your
behalfs.'  ('Well, whaddya know!' muttered Mr Jed
Midnight with something like awe in his voice.)  'That,
gentlemen and—er—madam, is how I knew of you and
how I came to invite here tonight what I have learned
through my own experience to be the aristocracy, if I may
so describe it, of American crime.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond was impressed.  Goldfinger had, in three minutes
flat, got the meeting on his side.  Now everyone was looking
towards Goldfinger with profound attention.  Even Miss
Pussy Galore's eyes were rapt.  Bond knew nothing about
the Golden Poppy Distributors or the Happy Landings
Agency, but they must have run like clockwork from
the expressions on their former customers' faces.  Now
everyone was hanging on Goldfinger's words as if he was
Einstein.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger's face showed no emotion.  He made a
throwaway gesture of his right hand.  He said flatly, 'I
have mentioned two projects of mine that were successful.
They were small.  There have been many others of a
higher calibre.  Not one of them has failed, and, so far as I
know, my name is on the police files of no country.  I say
this to show you that I thoroughly understand
my—our—profession.  And now, gentlemen and madam, I propose
to offer you partnership in an undertaking that will
assuredly place in each of your treasuries, within one week,
the sum of one billion dollars.'  Mr Goldfinger held up his
hand.  'We have different views in Europe and America as
to what constitutes the arithmetical expression "a billion".
I use the word in the sense of one thousand million.  Do I
make myself clear?'

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN
<br class="calibre6"/>
CRIME DE LA CRIME
</h3>

<p class="calibre4">
A tug hooted on the river.  Another answered.  A
flurry of engine noises receded.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Jed Midnight, on Bond's right, cleared his
throat.  He said emphatically, 'Mister Gold, or whatever
your name is, don't you worry about definitions.  A billion
dollars is a lot of money whichever way you say it.  Keep
talking.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Solo raised slow black eyes and looked across the
table at Goldfinger.  He said, 'Is very moch money, yess.
But how moch your cut, mister?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Five billion.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Jack Strap from Las Vegas gave a short boisterous laugh.
'Listen fellers, what's a few billion between friends.  If
Mister—er—Whoosis can lead me to a billion dollars I'll
be glad to slip him a fin or even maybe a mega-fin for his
trouble.  Don't let's be small-minded about this, huh?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Helmut Springer tapped his monocle on the gold
brick in front of him.  Everyone looked towards him.
'Mister—ah—Gold.'  It was the grave voice of the family
lawyer.  'These are big figures you mention.  As I understand
it, a total of some eleven billion dollars is involved.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Goldfinger said with precision, 'The exact figure
will be nearer fifteen billion.  For convenience I referred
only to the amounts I thought it would be possible for us
to carry away.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
A sharp excited giggle came from Mr Billy Ring.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Quite, quite, Mr Gold.'  Mr Springer screwed his
monocle back into his eye to observe Goldfinger's reactions.
'But quantities of bullion or currency to that amount
are to be found gathered together in only three depositories
in the United States.  They are the Federal Mint in
Washington, the Federal Reserve Bank in New York
City, and Fort Knox in Kentucky.  Do you intend that we
should—er—"knock off" one of these?  And if so which?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Fort Knox.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Amidst the chorus of groans, Mr Midnight said resignedly,
'Mister, I never met any guy outside Hollywood
that had what you've got.  There it's called "vision".  And
vision, mister, is a talent for mistaking spots before the
eyes for fabulous projects.  You should have a talk with
your head-shrinker or get yourself Miltownized.'  Mr
Midnight shook his head sorrowfully.  'Too bad.  That
billion sure felt good while I had it.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Miss Pussy Galore said in a deep, bored voice, 'Sorry
mister, none of my set of bent pins could take that kind of
piggy-bank.'  She made to get up.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger said amiably, 'Now hear me through,
gentlemen and—er—madam.  Your reaction was not
unexpected.  Let me put it this way: Fort Knox is a bank
like any other bank.  But it is a much bigger bank and its
protective devices are correspondingly stronger and more
ingenious.  To penetrate them will require corresponding
strength and ingenuity.  That is the only novelty in my
project—that it is a big one.  Nothing else.  Fort Knox is
no more impregnable than other fortresses.  No doubt we
all thought the Brink organization was unbeatable until
half a dozen determined men robbed a Brink-armoured
car of a million dollars back in 1950.  It is impossible to
escape from Sing Sing and yet men have found ways of
escaping from it.  No, no, gentlemen.  Fort Knox is a
myth like other myths.  Shall I proceed to the plan?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Billy Ring hissed through his teeth, like a Japanese,
when he talked.  He said harshly, 'Listen, shamus, mebbe
ya didn't know it, but the Third Armoured is located at
Fort Knox.  If that's a myth, why don't the Russkis come
and take the United States the next time they have a team
over here playing ice-hockey?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger smiled thinly.  'If I may correct you without
weakening your case, Mr Ring, the following is the order
of battle of the military units presently quartered at Fort
Knox.  Of the Third Armoured Division, there is only the
Spearhead, but there are also the 6th Armoured Cavalry
Regiment, the 15th Armour Group, the 160th Engineer
Group and approximately half a division from all units of
the United States Army currently going through the
Armoured Replacement Training Centre and Military
Human Research Unit No. 1.  There is also a considerable
body of men associated with Continental Armoured
Command Board No. 2, the Army Maintenance Board and
various activities connected with the Armoured Centre.  In
addition there is a police force consisting of twenty officers
and some four hundred enlisted men.  In short, out of a
total population of some sixty thousand, approximately
twenty thousand are combat troops of one sort or another.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'And who's going to say boo to them?' jeered Mr Jack
Strap through his cigar.  Without waiting for an answer he
disgustedly tore the tattered stump out of his mouth and
mashed it to fragments in the ash-tray.

<p class="calibre4">
Next to him Miss Pussy Galore sucked her teeth sharply
with the incisiveness of a parrot spitting.  She said, 'Go
buy yourself some better smokes, Jacko.  That thing smells
like burning wrestlers' trunks.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Shove it, Puss,' said Mr Strap inelegantly.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Miss Galore was determined to have the last word.  She
said sweetly, 'Know what, Jacko?  I could go for a he-man
like you.  Matter of fact I wrote a song about you the
other day.  Care to hear its title?  It's called "If I had to do
it all over again, I'd do it all over you".
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
A bray of laughter came from Mr Midnight, a high
giggle from Mr Ring.  Goldfinger tapped lightly for order.
He said patiently, 'Now hear me through, please,
gentlemen.'  He got up and walked to the blackboard and pulled
a roll map down over it.  It was a detailed town map of
Fort Knox including the Godman Army Airfield and the
roads and railway tracks leading into the town.  The
committee members on the right of the table swivelled
their chairs.  Goldfinger pointed to the Bullion Depository.
It was down on the left-hand corner enclosed in a triangle
formed by the Dixie Highway, Bullion Boulevard and
Vine Grove Road.  Goldfinger said, 'I will show you a
detailed plan of the depository in just a moment.'  He
paused.  'Now, gentlemen, allow me to point out the main
features of this fairly straightforward township.
Here'—he ran his finger from the top centre of the map down
through the town and out beyond the Bullion Depository—'runs
the line of the Illinois Central Railroad from
Louisville, thirty-five miles to the north, through the town
and on to Elizabethtown eighteen miles to the south.
We are not concerned with Brandenburg Station in the
centre of the town, but with this complex of sidings
adjoining the Bullion Vault.  That is one of the loading and
unloading bays for the bullion from the Mint in Washington.
Other methods of transport to the vault, which are
varied in no particular rotation for security reasons, are by
truck convoy down the Dixie Highway or by freight plane
to Godman Airfield.  As you can see, the vault is isolated
from these routes and stands alone without any natural
cover whatsoever in the centre of approximately fifty
acres of grassland.  Only one road leads to the vault, a
fifty-yard driveway through heavily armed gates on
Bullion Boulevard.  Once inside the armoured stockade,
the trucks proceed on to this circular road which runs
round the vault to the rear entrance where the bullion is
unloaded.  That circular road, gentlemen, is manufactured
out of steel plates or flaps.  These plates are on hinges and
in an emergency the entire steel surface of the road can be
raised hydraulically to create a second internal stockade
of steel.  Not so obvious to the eye, but known to me, is
that an underground delivery tunnel runs below the plain
between Bullion Boulevard and Vine Grove Road.  This
serves as an additional means of access to the vault through
steel doors that lead from the wall of the tunnel to the first
sub-ground floor of the depository.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger paused and stood away from the map.  He
looked round the table.  'All right, gentlemen.  There is the
vault and those are the main approaches to it with the
exception of its front door which is purely an entrance to
the reception hall and offices.  Any questions?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There were none.  All eyes were on Goldfinger, waiting.
Once again the authority of his words had gripped them.
This man seemed to know more about the secrets of Fort
Knox than had ever been released to the outside world.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger turned back to the blackboard and pulled
down a second map over the first.  This was the detailed
plan of the Gold Vault.  Goldfinger said, 'Well, gentlemen,
you can see that this is an immensely solid two-storey
building somewhat like a square, two-layered cake.  You
will notice that the roof has been stepped for bomb protection,
and you will observe the four pill boxes on the ground
at the four corners.  These are of steel and are connected
with the interior of the building.  The exterior dimensions
of the vault are a hundred and five by a hundred
and twenty-one feet.  The height from ground level is
forty-two feet.  The construction is of Tennessee granite,
steel-lined.  The exact constituents are: sixteen thousand
cubic feet of granite, four thousand cubic yards of concrete,
seven hundred and fifty tons of reinforcing steel and seven
hundred and sixty tons of structural steel.  Right?  Now,
within the building, there is a two-storey steel and concrete
vault divided into compartments.  The vault door weighs
more than twenty tons and the casing of the vault is of steel
plates, steel I-beams and steel cylinders laced with
hoop-bands and encased in concrete.  The roof is of similar
construction and is independent of the roof of the building.  A
corridor encircles the vault at both levels and gives access
both to the vault and to the offices and storerooms that are
housed in the outer wall of the building.  No one person is
entrusted with the combination to the door of the vault.
Various senior members of the depository staff must
separately dial combinations known only to each of them.
Naturally the building is equipped with the latest and
finest protective devices.  There is a strong guard-post
within the building and immensely powerful reinforcements are
at all times available from the Armoured Centre less than
a mile distant.  Do you follow me?  Now, as to the actual
content of the vault—these amount, as I said earlier, to
some fifteen billion dollars' worth of standard mint bars
one thousand fine.  Each bar is double the size of the one
before you and contains four hundred Troy ounces, the
avoirdupois weight being some twenty-seven and a half
pounds.  These are stored without wrappings in the
compartments of the vault.'  Goldfinger glanced round the
table.  'And that, gentlemen and madam,' he concluded
flatly, 'is all I can tell you, and all I think we need to
know, about the nature and contents of Fort Knox
Depository.  Unless there are any questions at this stage, I
will proceed to a brief explanation of how this depository
may be penetrated and its contents seized.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There was silence.  The eyes round the table were rapt,
intent.  Nervously, Mr Jack Strap took a medium-sized
cigar out of his vest pocket and stuffed it in the corner of
his mouth.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Pussy Galore said sternly, 'If you set fire to that thing I
swear I'll kayo you with my gold brick.'  She took a
threatening hold of the bar.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Take it easy, kid,' said Mr Strap out of the corner of his
mouth.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Jed Midnight commented decisively, 'Mister, if you
can heist that joint, you got yourself a summum cum
laude.  Go ahead and tell.  This is either a bust or the Crime
de la Crime.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger said indifferently, 'Very well, gentlemen.
You shall hear the plan.'  He paused and looked carefully
round the table and into each pair of eyes in turn.  'But
I hope you understand that total security must now
prevail.  What I have said so far, if repeated, would be
taken for the maunderings of a lunatic.  What I am about
to say will involve all of us in the greatest peace-time
conspiracy in the history of the United States.  May I take
it that we are all bound by an oath of absolute secrecy?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Almost instinctively, Bond watched the eyes of Mr
Helmut Springer from Detroit.  While affirmatives in
various tones of voice came from the others, Mr Springer
veiled his eyes.  His portentous 'You have my solemn
word' rang hollow.  To Bond, the candour was as false as a
second-hand motor salesman's.  Casually he drew a short
straight minus line beside Mr Springer's name on the
agenda.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Very well then.'  Goldfinger returned to his seat at the
table.  He sat down, picked up his pencil and began talking
to it in a thoughtful, conversational voice.  'First, and in
some ways most difficult, is the question of disposal.  One
billion dollars of gold bullion weighs approximately one
thousand tons.  To transport this amount would require
one hundred ten-ton trucks or some twenty six-wheel
heavy industry road transporters.  I recommend the latter
vehicles.  I have a list of the charter companies who hire
out this type of vehicle and I recommend that, if we are to
be partners, you should proceed immediately after this
meeting to contracting with the relevant companies in
your territories.  For obvious reasons you will all wish to
engage your own drivers and this I must leave in your
hands.  No doubt'—Mr Goldfinger allowed himself the
ghost of a smile—'the Teamsters' Union will prove a
fruitful source for reliable men and you will perhaps
consider recruiting ex-drivers from the Negro Red Ball
Express that served the American armies during the war.
However, these are details requiring exact planning and
co-ordination.  There will also be a traffic control problem
and no doubt you will make arrangements among yourselves
for sharing out the available roads.  Transport
aircraft will be a subsidiary source of mobility and
arrangements will be made to keep open the north-south runway
on the Godman Airfield.  Your subsequent disposal of the
bullion will, of course, be your own affair.  For my
part'—Goldfinger looked coolly round the table—'I shall
initially be using the railroad and, since I have a bulkier
transport problem, I trust you will allow me to reserve this
means of egress for my own.'  Goldfinger did not wait for
comment.  He continued in an even tone: 'Compared with
this problem of transport, the other arrangements will be
relatively simple.  To begin with, on D-1, I propose to put
the entire population, military and civilian, of Fort Knox
temporarily out of action.  Exact arrangements have been
made and only await my signal.  Briefly, the town is
supplied with all drinking and other water-supplies by
two wells and two filter plants yielding just under seven
million gallons per day.  These are under the control of the
Post Engineer.  This gentleman has been pleased to accept
a visit from the Superintendent and Deputy Superintendent
of the Tokyo Municipal Waterworks who wish to
study the workings of a plant of this size for installation in
a new suburb planned for the environs of Tokyo.  The
Post Engineer has been much flattered by this request and
the Japanese gentlemen will be accorded all facilities.
These two gentlemen, who are, of course, members of my
staff, will be carrying on their persons relatively small
quantities of a highly concentrated opiate devised by the
German chemical warfare experts for just this purpose
during the last war.  This substance disseminates rapidly
through a volume of water of this magnitude, and, in its
consequent highly diluted form, has the effect of instant
but temporary narcosis of any person drinking half a
tumbler of the infected water.  The symptoms are a deep
and instant sleep from which the victim awakens much
refreshed in approximately three days.  Gentlemen—'
Goldfinger held out one hand palm upwards—'in the
month of June in Kentucky I consider it out of the question
that a single resident is able to go through twenty-four
hours without consuming half a glass of water.  There may
perhaps be a handful of confirmed alcoholics on their feet
on D-Day, but I anticipate that we shall enter a town in
which virtually the entire population has fallen into a deep
sleep where they stand.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'What was that fairy-tale?'  Miss Galore's eyes were
shining with the vision.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'<i class="calibre3">Puss in Boots</i>,' said Mr Jack Strap in a surly voice.  'Go
ahead, mister.  This is good.  How do we get into the town?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'We come in,' said Goldfinger, 'on a special train that
will have left New York City on the night of D-1.  There
will be approximately one hundred of us and we shall be
attired as Red Cross workers.  Miss Galore will, I hope,
provide the necessary contingent of nurses.  It is to fill this
minor but important role that she has been invited to this
meeting.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Miss Galore said enthusiastically, 'Wilco, Roger, over
and out!  My girls'll look sweet in starch.  Whaddya say,
Jacko?'  She leant sideways and nudged Mr Strap in the ribs.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I say they'd look better in cement overcoats,' said Mr
Strap impatiently.  'Whaddya have to keep on butting in
for?  Keep going, mister.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'At Louisville, thirty-five miles from Fort Knox, I
myself and an assistant will ask to be allowed to ride in the
leading diesel.  We shall have delicate instruments.  We
shall say that it will be necessary for us to sample the air
as we approach Fort Knox for, by this time, news of the
mysterious affliction that has struck down the inhabitants
will have reached the outer world and there is likely to be
some panic in the surrounding area, and indeed in the
country as a whole.  Rescue planes may be expected to
approach shortly after our arrival at dawn and an early
task will be to man the control tower at Godman Airfield,
declare the base closed and re-route all planes to
Louisville.  But, to go back for a moment, shortly after leaving
Louisville, my assistant and I will dispose of the driver and
fireman by as humane methods as are possible' (I bet,
thought Bond) 'and I shall personally bring the train—I
may say that I have the requisite knowledge of these
locomotives—through Fort Knox to the bullion sidings
alongside the depository.'  Goldfinger paused.  He looked
with slow, grave eyes round the circle.  Satisfied with what
he saw, he continued in the same even tone.  'By this time,
gentlemen and madam, your transport convoys should be
arriving.  The traffic controller will dispose them in the
neighbourhood of the depository according to a
pre-arranged plan, the airport staff will proceed by truck to
Godman Airfield and take over, and we shall enter the
depository, paying no heed to the sleeping bodies with
which the landscape will be—er—decorated.  Right?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Solo's dark eyes burned across the table.  He said
softly, 'Sure, is right so far.  Now mebbe you—' he blew
out his cheeks and gave a quick hard puff towards
Goldfinger—'like this and the twenty-ton door he fall
down.  Yes?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes,' said Goldfinger equably.  'Almost exactly like
that.'  He rose and went to the table under the blackboard,
lifted up the big ungainly carton and carried it carefully
back and placed it on the table in front of him.  It seemed to
be very heavy.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
He sat down and continued, 'While ten of my trained
assistants are making preparations for the vault to be
opened, stretcher teams will enter the depository and
remove to safety as many of the inmates as can be
located.'  Bond thought he noticed a treacherous purr underlying
Goldfinger's next words.  'I am sure you will all agree,
gentlemen and madam, that all unnecessary loss of life
should be avoided.  Thus far, I hope you notice that there
have been no casualties with the exception of two
employees of the Illinois Central Railroad who have received
sore heads.'  Goldfinger didn't wait for comment but went
on.  'Now,' he reached out and placed his hand on the
carton, 'when you, gentlemen, and your associates have
needed weapons, other than the conventional small arms,
where have you found them?  At military establishments,
gentlemen.  You have purchased sub-machine guns and
other heavy equipment from quartermaster storekeepers
at near-by military bases.  You have achieved this by the
use of pressure, blackmail or money.  I have done the same.
Only one weapon would be powerful enough to blast open
the Bullion Vault at Fort Knox and I obtained one, after
much seeking, from a certain allied military base in
Germany.  It cost me exactly one million dollars.  This,
gentlemen, is an atomic warhead designed for use with the
Corporal Intermediate Range Guided Missile.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Cheesus Kerist.'  Jed Midnight's hands reached for the
edge of the table beside Bond and gripped it.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
All the faces round the table were pale.  Bond could feel
the skin taut over his own tensed jaw.  To break his tension
he reached inside his coat pocket for the Chesterfields and
lit one.  He slowly blew out the flame and put the lighter
back in his pocket.  God Almighty!  What had he got
himself into?  Bond looked back down the vista of his
knowledge of Goldfinger.  The first meeting with the naked
brown body on the roof of the Floridiana Cabana Club.
The casual way he had rapped Goldfinger's knuckles.  The
interview with M.  The meeting at the bank at which it had
been a question of tracking down a gold smuggler—admittedly
a big one and one who worked for the Russians—but
still only a man-sized criminal, someone Bond had
taken trouble to beat at golf and then had pursued coolly,
efficiently, but still as only one more quarry like so many
others.  And now!  Now it was not a rabbit in the rabbit
hole, not even a fox, it was a king cobra—the biggest,
most deadly inhabitant of the world!  Bond sighed wearily.
Once more into the breach, dear friends!  This time it really
was St George and the dragon.  And St George had better
get a move on and do something before the dragon hatched
the little dragon's egg he was now nesting so confidently.
Bond smiled tautly.  Do what?  What in God's name was
there he could do?
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger held up his hand.  'Gentlemen and madam,
believe me, this object is an entirely harmless lump of
machinery.  It is not armed.  If I hit it with a hammer it
would not explode.  Nothing can make it explode until it
is armed and that will not happen until The Day.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Billy Ring's pale face was shiny with sweat.  The
words trembled slightly as they hissed out through the
false grin.  'Mister, what ... what about this thing they
call—er—fall-out?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Fall-out will be minimal, Mr Ring, and extremely
localized.  This is the latest model—the so-called "clean"
atomic bomb.  But protection suits will be issued to the
squad that first enters the ruins of the building.  They will
form the first in the human chain that will remove the
gold and pass it to the waiting trucks.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Flying debris, Mister?  Chunks of concrete and steel and
so forth?'  Mr Midnight's voice came from somewhere in
his stomach.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'We shall take shelter behind the outer steel stockade of
the depository, Mr Midnight.  All personnel will wear
ear-plugs.  There may be minor damage to some of the trucks,
but that hazard must be accepted.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Da sleeping guys?'  Mr Solo's eyes were greedy.  'Mebbe
dey jess sleeps a liddle longer?'  Mr Solo obviously didn't
worry too much about the sleeping guys.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'We shall move as many as possible to safety.  We must,
I am afraid, accept minor damage to the town.  I estimate
that casualties among the population will approximately
equal three days' toll on the roads of Fort Knox.  Our
operation will merely serve to keep road accident statistics
at a steady level.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Damn nice of us.'  Mr Midnight's nerves had now
recovered.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Any more questions?'  Goldfinger's voice was bland.
He had read out the figures, estimated the prospects for
the business.  Now it was time to put the meeting to the
vote.  'Details remain to be worked out exactly.  In that,
my staff here'—he turned first to Bond and then to Miss
Masterton—'will be assisting me.  This room will be our
operations room to which you will all have access by day
or by night.  The code word for the project is "Operation
Grand Slam", which will always be used in referring to
the project.  May I suggest that those of you who wish to
participate should brief one, and only one, of your most
trusted lieutenants.  Other staff can be trained for their
functions as if this were a run-of-the-mill bank robbery.
On D-1 a slightly wider briefing of staff will be necessary.
I know I can rely on you, gentlemen and madam, if you
decide to participate, to treat this whole project as an
operation of war.  Inefficiency or insecurity will of course
have to be dealt with decisively.  And now, gentlemen and
madam, I will ask you to reply on behalf of your respective
organizations.  Which of you wishes to enter this race?
The prize is gigantic.  The risks are minimal.  Mr
Midnight?'  Goldfinger turned his head an inch to the right.
Bond saw the wide open X-ray gaze devour his neighbour.
'Yes?'  There was a pause.  'Or no?'
</p>

CHAPTER NINETEEN
<br class="calibre6"/>
SECRET APPENDIX
</h3>

<p class="calibre4">
'Mr Gold,' Jed Midnight pronounced sonorously,
'you are undoubtedly the greatest thing in crime
since Cain invented murder and used it on Abel.'  He
paused and added emphatically, 'I shall count it an
honour to be associated with you in this enterprise.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Thank you, Mr Midnight.  And you, Mr Ring?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond was doubtful about Mr Billy Ring.  He had
scrawled plusses against all the names except Ring and
Helmut Springer.  To Mr Ring he had allotted a nought,
to Springer a minus sign.  He had come to his conclusions
by watching eyes, mouths, hands, but nothing had been
betrayed by The Grinner's unwavering false smile.  The
wink in his right eye had been as steady on the pulse-beat
as a metronome and he had kept his hands below the
table.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Now Billy Ring brought his hands up from below the
table and formed a cat's cradle with them on the green
baize in front of him.  For a moment he watched the two
thumbs twirling, then he raised his nightmare face to
Goldfinger's.  The tic in his right eye had stopped.  The
two rows of teeth began to operate like a ventriloquist's
dummy.  'Mister—' he found difficulty with his b's, m's
and p's and produced them by bringing his upper lip
down over his teeth like a horse does when it takes sugar
out of your hand—'long time now my friends and I been
back in legal.  What I mean, the old days of leaving corpses
strewn all over the landscape went out with the 'forties.  Me
and my associates, we do all right with the girls, the hemp,
and the racetrack, and when we're short there's our good
friends the Unions to slip us the odd fin.  Ya see,
mister—'  The Grinner opened his hands and then put them back
into the cradle—'we figger the old days are gone.  Big Jim
Colossimo, Johnny Torrio, Dion O'Bannion, Al Capone—where
are those guys today, huh?  Mister, they're
pushing up the morning glory by the fence.  Mebbe you
weren't around in the days when we used to hide up
between fights in Little Bohemia up behind Milwaukee?
Well, siree, in those days, people were shooting at each
other so fast you'd often need a programme to tell the act
from the spectators.  So all right, people got tired of
it—those that hadn't already got tired to death, if you get my
meaning—and when the 'fifties come along and I take
over the team, it's unanimous that we get out of the
fireworks business.  And now what, mister?  Now you come
along and put it to me that me and my friends assist you
to let off the biggest fizzbang in history!  So what do I
figger to say to your proposition, Mister—er—Whoosis?
Well, I tell you, mister.  Everybody's got his price,
see?—and for a billion dollars it's a deal.  We'll put away the
marbles and bring out the sling-shots.  We're in.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Grinner, you sure take one hell of a long time to say
yes,' commented Mr Midnight sourly.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger said cordially, 'Thank you for your most
interesting statement, Mr Ring.  I am very happy to
welcome you and your associates.  Mr Solo?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Solo prefaced his reply by reaching into his coat
pocket and taking out a battery shaver.  He switched it on.
The room filled with the noise of angry bees.  Mr Solo leant
his head back and began running the machine thoughtfully
up the right side of his face while his uptilted eyes
sought decision in the ceiling.  Suddenly he switched the
razor off, put it down on the table in front of him and
jerked his head down and forward like a snake striking.
The black gun-muzzles of his eyes pointed threateningly
across the table at Goldfinger and moved slowly from
feature to feature of the big moon-face.  Half Mr Solo's
own face now looked naked.  The other half was dark with
the Italian swarthiness that comes from an uncontrollable
beard growth.  Bond guessed that he probably had to shave
every three or four hours.  Now Mr Solo decided to speak.
He spoke in a voice that brought chill into the room.  He
said softly, 'Mister, I been watching you.  You are a very
relaxed man for someone who speaks such big things.  Last
man I knew was so much relaxed he got himself totally
relaxed by a quick burst of the chopper.  Okay, okay.'  Mr
Solo sat back.  He spread open palms in reluctant
surrender.  'So I come in, yes.  But mister—' there was a
pause for emphasis—'either we get that billion or you
get dead.  Is okay with you?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger's lips bent ironically.  'Thank you, Mr Solo.
Your conditions are quite acceptable.  I have every wish to
stay alive.  Mr Helmut Springer?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Springer's eyes looked deader than ever.  He said
pompously, 'I am still giving the matter my full consideration.
Pray consult my colleagues while I deliberate.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Midnight commented impatiently, 'Same old Hell.
Waits for what he calls inspiration.  He's guided—messages
from the Almighty on the angels' wavelength.
I guess he hasn't heard a human voice in twenty years.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'And Mr Strap?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Jack Strap crinkled his eyes at Goldfinger.  He said
smoothly, 'Mister, I figure you know the odds and you
surely pay the best since one of our machines at Vegas got
the trots and gave continuous jackpots.  I guess if we
provide the muscles and the guns this caper'll pay off.  You
can count me in.'  Mr Strap turned off the charm.  His
eyes, now frightening again, turned, with Goldfinger's, to
Miss Pussy Galore.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Miss Galore veiled her violet eyes so as not to have to
look at either of them.  She said indifferently to the room
at large, 'Business ain't been so brisk in my corner of the
woods.'  She tapped with long, silver-painted finger-nails
on the gold bar before her.  'Mind you, I won't say I'm
overdrawn at the bank.  Let's put it I'm just a shade
underdeposited.  Yup.  Sure I'll come in.  Me and my gals got
to eat.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger allowed himself a half-smile of sympathy.
'That is excellent news, Miss Galore.  And now,' he turned
to face across the table, 'Mr Springer, might we ask if you
have made up your mind?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Slowly Mr Springer rose to his feet.  He gave the
controlled yawn of an opera-goer.  He followed the yawn
with a small belch.  He took out a fine linen handkerchief
and patted his lips.  His glazed eyes moved round the table
and finally rested on Goldfinger.  Slowly his head moved
from side to side as if he was trying to exercise fibrositis in
his neck muscles.  He said gravely, like a bank manager
refusing a loan, 'Mr Gold, I fear your proposal would not
find favour with my colleagues in Detroit.'  He gave a
little bow which included everyone.  'It only remains for
me to thank you for a most interesting occasion.  Good
afternoon, gentlemen and madam.'  In the chilly silence,
Mr Springer tucked his handkerchief carefully into the
left-hand cuff of his immaculate pin-stripe, turned and
walked softly to the door and let himself out.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The door closed with a sharp click.  Bond noticed
Goldfinger's hand slip casually below the table.  He guessed
that Oddjob was getting his signal.  Signal for what?
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Midnight said nastily, 'Glad he's out.  He's strictly a
four-ulcer man.  Now then—' he got up briskly and
turned to Bond—'how about a little drink?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
They all rose and gathered round the buffet.  Bond
found himself between Miss Pussy Galore and Tilly
Masterton.  He offered them champagne.  Miss Galore
looked at him coldly and said, 'Move over, Handsome.  Us
girls want to talk secrets.  Don't we, yummy?'  Miss
Masterton blushed and then turned very pale.  She
whispered adoringly, 'Oh yes please, Miss Galore.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond smiled sourly at Tilly Masterton and moved down
the room.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Jed Midnight had witnessed the snub.  He got close to
Bond and said earnestly, 'Mister, if that's your doll, you
better watch her.  Pussy gets the girls she wants.  She
consumes them in bunches—like grapes, if you follow me.'  Mr
Midnight sighed wearily.  'Cheesus how they bore me, the
lizzies!  You'll see, she'll soon have that frail parting her
hair three ways in front of the mirror.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said cheerfully, 'I'll watch out.  There's nothing
much I can do.  She's an independent sort of a girl.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'That so?' said Mr Midnight with a spark of interest.
'Well mebbe I can help to break it up.'  He straightened
his tie.  'I could go for that Masterton.  She's sure got
natural resources.  See you around.'  He grinned at Bond
and moved off down the room.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond was having a quiet square meal off caviar and
champagne and thinking how well Goldfinger had
handled the meeting when the door at the end of the room
opened and one of the Koreans hurried in and went up to
Goldfinger.  Goldfinger bent his head to the whispered
words.  His face became grave.  He rapped a fork on his
glass of Saratoga Vichy.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Gentlemen and madam.'  He looked sadly round the
group.  'I have received bad news.  Our friend Mr Helmut
Springer has met with an accident.  He fell down the stairs.
Death was instantaneous.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Ho, ho!'  Mr Ring's laugh was not a laugh.  It was a
hole in the face.  'And what does that Slappy Hapgood, his
torpedo, have to say about it?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger said gravely, 'Alas, Mr Hapgood also fell
down the stairs and has succumbed to his injuries.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Solo looked at Goldfinger with new respect.  He said
softly, 'Mister, you better get those stairs fixed before me
and my friend Giulio come to use them.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger said seriously, 'The fault has been located.
Repairs will be put in hand at once.'  His face grew
thoughtful.  'I fear these accidents may be misconstrued in
Detroit.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Jed Midnight said cheerfully, 'Don't give it a thought,
mister.  They love funerals up there.  And it'll take a load
off their minds.  Old Hell wouldn't have lasted much
longer.  They been stoking the fires under him these twelve
months.'  He appealed to Mr Strap who stood next to him.
'Am I right, Jacko?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Sure, Jed,' said Mr Strap sagely.  'You got the score.
Mr Helmut M. Springer had to be hit.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4"><br class="calibre1"/></p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Hit'—mobese for murder.  When Bond at last got to
bed that night, he couldn't wipe the word out of his mind.
Oddjob had got the signal, a double ring, and Springer
and his guard had got hit.  There had been nothing Bond
could have done about it—even if he had wanted to, and
Mr Helmut Springer meant nothing to him, probably
richly deserved to be hit anyway—but now some
59,998 other people were going to get hit unless he, and
only he, could do something about it.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
When the meeting of paramount hoods had broken up
to go about their various duties, Goldfinger had dismissed
the girl and kept Bond in the room.  He told Bond to take
notes and then for more than two hours went over the
operation down to the smallest detail.  When they came to
the doping of the two reservoirs (Bond had to work out an
exact timetable to ensure that the people of Fort Knox
would all be 'under' in good time) Bond had asked for
details of the drug and its speed of action.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'You won't have to worry about that.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Why not?  Everything depends on it.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Mr Bond.'  Goldfinger's eyes had a faraway, withdrawn
look.  'I will tell you the truth because you will have no
opportunity of passing it on.  From now, Oddjob will not
be more than a yard from your side and his orders will be
strict and exact.  So I can tell you that the entire
population of Fort Knox will be dead or incapacitated by
midnight on D-1.  The substance that will be inserted in
the water supply, outside the filter plant, will be a highly
concentrated form of GB.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'You're mad!  You don't really mean you're going to
kill sixty thousand people!'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Why not?  American motorists do it every two years.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond stared into Goldfinger's face in fascinated horror.
It couldn't be true!  He couldn't mean it!  He said tensely,
'What's this GB?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'GB is the most powerful of the Trilone group of nerve
poisons.  It was perfected by the Wehrmacht in 1943, but
never used for fear of reprisals.  In fact, it is a more
effective instrument of destruction than the hydrogen
bomb.  Its disadvantage lies in the difficulty of applying it
to the populace.  The Russians captured the entire German
stocks at Dyhernfurth on the Polish frontier.  Friends of
mine were able to supply me with the necessary quantities.
Introduction through the water supply is an ideal method
of applying it to a densely populated area.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said, 'Goldfinger, you're a lousy, —— bastard.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Don't be childish.  We have work to do.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Later, when they had got to the problem of transporting
the tons of gold out of the town, Bond had had one last
try.  He said, 'Goldfinger, you're not going to get this stuff
away.  Nobody's going to get their hundred tons of gold
out of the place—let alone five hundred.  You'll find
yourself tearing down the Dixie Highway in a truck with a few
gold bars loaded with gamma rays and the American Army
on your tail.  And you'll have killed sixty thousand people
for that?  The thing's farcical.  Even if you do get a ton or two
away, where the hell do you think you're going to hide it?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Mr Bond.'  Goldfinger's patience was infinite.  'It just
happens that a Soviet cruiser of the <i class="calibre3">Sverdlovsk</i> class will be
visiting Norfolk, Virginia, on a goodwill cruise at that
time.  It sails from Norfolk on D+1.  Initially by train and
then by transporter convoy, my gold will arrive on board
the cruiser by midnight on D-Day.  I shall sail in the
cruiser for Kronstadt.  Everything has been carefully
planned, every possible hitch has been foreseen.  I have
lived with this operation for five years.  Now the time has
come for the performance.  I have tidied up my activities
in England and Europe.  Such small debris as remains of
my former life can go to the scavengers who will shortly be
sniffing on my trail.  I shall be gone.  I shall have emigrated
and, Mr Bond, I shall have taken the golden heart of
America with me.  Naturally'—Goldfinger was
indulgent—'this unique performance will not be immaculate.
There has not been enough time for rehearsals.  I need
these clumsy gangsters with their guns and their men, but
I could not bring them into the plan until the last moment.
They will make mistakes.  Conceivably they will have
much trouble getting their own loot away.  Some will be
caught, others killed.  I couldn't care less.  These men are
amateurs who were needed, so to speak, for the crowd
scenes.  They are extras, Mr Bond, brought in off the
streets.  What happens to them after the play is of no
interest to me whatsoever.  And now, on with the work.  I
shall need seven copies of all this by nightfall.  Where
were we...?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
So in fact, reflected Bond feverishly, this was not only a
Goldfinger operation with SMERSH in the background.
SMERSH had even got the High Praesidium to play.  This
was Russia versus America with Goldfinger as the
spearhead!  Was it an act of war to steal something from
another country?  But who would know that Russia had the
gold?  No one, if the plan went off as Goldfinger intended.
None of the gangsters had an inkling.  To them Goldfinger
was just another of them, another gangster, slightly larger
than life-size.  And Goldfinger's staff, his drivers for the
golden convoy to the coast?  Bond himself, and Tilly
Masterton?  Some would be killed, including him and the
girl.  Some, the Koreans for instance, would no doubt sail
in the cruiser.  Not a trace would be left, not a witness.  It
was modern piracy with all the old-time trimmings.
Goldfinger was sacking Fort Knox as Bloody Morgan had
sacked Panama.  There was no difference except that the
weapons and the techniques had been brought up to date.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
And there was only one man in the whole world who
could stop it.  But how?
</p>

<p class="calibre4"><br class="calibre1"/></p>

<p class="calibre4">
The next day was an unending blizzard of paper-work.
Every half-hour a note would come in from Goldfinger's
operations room asking for schedules of this, copies of that,
estimates, timetables, lists of stores.  Another typewriter
was brought in, maps, reference books—anything that
Bond requisitioned.  But not once did Oddjob relax the
extreme care with which he opened the door to Bond's
knock, not once did his watchful eyes wander from Bond's
eyes, hands, feet when he came into the room to bring
meals or notes or supplies.  There was no question of Bond
and the girl being part of the team.  They were dangerous
slaves and nothing else.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Tilly Masterton was equally reserved.  She worked like a
machine—quick, willing, accurate, but uncommunicative.
She responded with cool politeness to Bond's early
attempts to make friends, share his thoughts with her.  By
the evening, he had learnt nothing about her except that
she had been a successful amateur ice-skater in between
secretarial work for Unilevers.  Then she had started
getting star parts in ice-shows.  Her hobby had been indoor
pistol and rifle shooting and she had belonged to two
marksman clubs.  She had few friends.  She had never been
in love or engaged.  She lived by herself in two rooms in
Earls Court.  She was twenty-four.  Yes, she realized that
they were in a bad fix.  But something would turn up.
This Fort Knox business was nonsense.  It would certainly
go wrong.  She thought Miss Pussy Galore was 'divine'.
She somehow seemed to count on her to get her out of this
mess.  Women, with a sniff, were rather good at things that
needed finesse.  Instinct told them what to do.  Bond was
not to worry about her.  She would be all right.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond came to the conclusion that Tilly Masterton was
one of those girls whose hormones had got mixed up.  He
knew the type well and thought they and their male
counterparts were a direct consequence of giving votes to
women and 'sex equality'.  As a result of fifty years of
emancipation, feminine qualities were dying out or being
transferred to the males.  Pansies of both sexes were
everywhere, not yet completely homosexual, but confused, not
knowing what they were.  The result was a herd of unhappy
sexual misfits—barren and full of frustrations, the women
wanting to dominate and the men to be nannied.  He was
sorry for them, but he had no time for them.  Bond smiled
sourly to himself as he remembered his fantasies about this
girl as they sped along the valley of the Loire.  Entre Deux
Seins indeed!
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
At the end of the day, there was a final note from
Goldfinger:
</p>

<p class="quote">
Five principals and myself will leave La Guardia
Airport tomorrow at 11 a.m. in chartered plane
flown by my pilots for aerial survey of Grand Slam.
You will accompany.  Masterton will remain.  G.
</p>

<p class="calibre4"><br class="calibre1"/></p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond sat on the edge of his bed and looked at the wall.
Then he got up and went to the typewriter.  He worked for
an hour, typing, single-spaced, on both sides of the sheet,
exact details of the operation.  He folded the sheet, rolled
it to a small cylinder about the size of his little finger and
sealed it carefully with gum.  Next he typed on a slip of
paper:
</p>

<p class="quote">
URGENT AND VITAL.  REWARD OF FIVE THOUSAND
DOLLARS IS GUARANTEED WITH NO QUESTIONS ASKED TO
THE FINDER WHO DELIVERS THIS MESSAGE UNOPENED TO

ON DELIVERY.
</p>

<p class="calibre4"><br class="calibre1"/></p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond rolled this message round the cylinder, wrote
$5000 REWARD in red ink on the outside, and stuck the
little package down the centre of three inches of Scotch
tape.  Then he sat down again on the edge of the bed and
carefully strapped the free ends of the Scotch tape down
the inside of his thigh.

CHAPTER TWENTY
<br class="calibre6"/>
JOURNEY INTO HOLOCAUST
</h3>

<p class="calibre4">
'Mister, Flying Control is buzzing us.  Wants to
know who we are.  They say this is restricted air.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger got up from his seat and went forward
into the cockpit.  Bond watched him pick up the
hand microphone.  His voice came back clearly over the
quiet hum of the ten-seater Executive Beechcraft.  'Good
morning.  This is Mr Gold of Paramount Pictures Corporation.
We are carrying out an authorized survey of the
territory for a forthcoming 'A' picture of the famous
Confederate raid of 1861 which resulted in the capture of
General Sherman at Muldraugh Hill.  Yes, that's right.
Gary Grant and Elizabeth Taylor in the lead.  What's
that?  Clearance?  Sure we've got clearance.  Let me see
now' (Goldfinger consulted nothing) '—yes, here it is.
Signed by Chief of Special Services at the Pentagon.
Sure, the Commanding Officer at the Armoured Centre
will have a copy.  Okay and thanks.  Hope you'll enjoy the
picture.  'Bye.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger wiped the breezy expression off his face,
handed over the microphone and came back into the
cabin.  He braced his legs and stood looking down at his
passengers.  'Well, gentlemen and madam, do you think
you've seen enough?  I think you'll agree it's all pretty
clear and conforms with your copies of the town plan.  I
don't want to go much lower than six thousand.  Perhaps
we could make one more circuit and be off.  Oddjob, get
out the refreshments.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There was a mumble of comment and questions which
Goldfinger dealt with one by one.  Oddjob got up from
Bond's side and walked down to the rear.  Bond followed
him and, under his hard, suspicious stare, went into the
little lavatory and locked the door.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
He sat down calmly and thought.  There hadn't been a
chance on the way down to La Guardia.  He had sat with
Oddjob in the back of an unobtrusive Buick saloon.  The
doors had been locked on them by the driver and the
windows tightly closed.  Goldfinger had ridden in front,
the partition closed behind him.  Oddjob had sat slightly
sideways, his horn-ridged hands held ready on his thighs
like heavy tools.  He had not taken his eyes off Bond until
the car had driven round the boundary to the charter
hangars and come up alongside the private plane.
Sandwiched between Goldfinger and Oddjob, Bond had had no
alternative but to climb up the steps into the plane and
take his seat with Oddjob beside him.  Ten minutes later,
the others had arrived.  There was no communication with
them except an exchange of curt greetings.  They were all
different now—no smart remarks, no unnecessary talk.
These were men who had gone to war.  Even Pussy
Galore, in a black Dacron macintosh with a black leather
belt, looked like some young S.S. guardsman.  Once or
twice in the plane she had turned and looked at Bond
rather thoughtfully.  But she hadn't answered his smile.
Perhaps she just couldn't understand where Bond fitted in,
who he was.  When they got back to La Guardia there would
be the same routine.  It was now or never.  But where?
Among the leaves of lavatory paper?  But they might be
disturbed too soon or not for weeks.  Would the ash-tray be
emptied?  Possibly not.  But one thing would.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There was a rattle at the door-handle.  Oddjob was
getting restless.  Perhaps Bond was setting fire to the plane.
Bond called, 'Coming, ape.'  He got up and lifted the seat.
He tore the little package off the inside of his thigh and
transferred it to the underside of the fore-edge of the seat.
The seat would have to be lifted to get at the Elsan and
that would certainly be looked to as soon as the plane got
back to the hangar.  The $5000 REWARD stared back at
him boldly.  Not even the most hasty cleaner could miss it.
So long as no one preceded the cleaner.  But Bond didn't
think any of the passengers would lift the seat.  The little
compartment was too cramped to stand comfortably in.
He softly put the seat down, ran some water in the basin,
washed his face and smoothed his hair and walked out.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Oddjob was waiting angrily.  He pushed past Bond,
looked carefully round the lavatory and came out again,
shutting the door.  Bond walked back to his seat.  Now the
SOS was in the bottle and the bottle had been committed
to the waves.  Who would be the finder?  How soon?
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Everyone, down to the pilot and co-pilot, went to the
blasted little lavatory before they got back on the ground.
As each one came out, Bond expected to feel the cold nose
of a gun in his neck, the harsh suspicious words, the
crackle of the paper being unfolded.  But at last they were
back in the Buick and speeding over the Triborough into
uptown Manhattan and then down the river on the
parkway and in through the well-guarded doors of the
warehouse and back to work.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Now it was a race—a race between Goldfinger's calm,
unhurried, efficient machine and the tiny gunpowder trail
Bond had lit.  What was going on outside?  During every
hour of the next three days Bond's imagination followed
what might be happening—Leiter telling his chief, the
conference, the quick flight down to Washington, the
F.B.I. and Hoover, the Army, the President.  Leiter
insisting that Bond's conditions be adhered to, that no
suspicious moves be made, no inquiries started, that no
one moved an inch except according to some master plan
that would operate on the day and get the whole gang into
the bag so that not one of them escaped.  Would they
accept Bond's conditions or would they not dare take the
chance?  Had they talked across the Atlantic with M?  Had
M insisted that Bond should be somehow pulled out?  No,
M would see the point.  He would agree that Bond's life
must be disregarded.  That nothing must jeopardize the
big clean-up.  They would have to get the two 'Japanese',
of course, somehow beat out of them the code message
Goldfinger would be waiting for on D-1.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Was that how it was going, or was it all a shambles?
Leiter away on another assignment.  'Who is this 007?
What does it stand for?  Some crazy loon.  Hi, Smith,
check on this, could you?  Get down to the warehouse and
take a look.  Sorry, mister, no five grand for you.  Here's
car fare back to La Guardia.  Afraid you've been hoaxed.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Or, worse still, had none of these things happened?  Was
the plane still standing in a corner of the field, unserviced?
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Night and day, the torment of thoughts went through
Bond's head while the work got cleared and the hours
ticked by and the deadly machine whirred quietly on.
D-1 came and flashed by in a last fever of activity.  Then,
in the evening, came the note from Goldfinger.
</p>

<p class="quote">
First phase of operation successful.  Entrain as planned
at midnight.  Bring copies of all maps, schedules,
operation orders.  G.
</p>

<p class="calibre4"><br class="calibre1"/></p>

<p class="calibre4">
In close formation, with Bond and Tilly Masterton—he
in a white surgeon's coat, she dressed as a nurse—wedged
in the middle, the Goldfinger contingent marched
swiftly through the almost empty Concourse of Pennsylvania
station and down to the waiting Special.  Everyone,
including Goldfinger, was wearing the conventional white
garb and armbands of a medical field force and the dim
platform was crowded with the ghostly waiting figures of
the posses from the gangs.  The silence and tension was
appropriate for an emergency force hurrying to the
scene of a disaster, and the stretchers and decontamination
suits being loaded into the compartments added
drama to the scene.  The Superintendent was talking
quietly with the senior physicians in the shape of
Midnight, Strap, Solo and Ring.  Near by stood Miss Galore
with a dozen pale-faced nurses who waited with eyes bent
as if they stood beside an open grave.  Without make-up,
their exotic hair-do's tucked into dark blue Red Cross
caps, they had been well rehearsed.  They were giving an
excellent performance—dutiful, merciful, dedicated to
the relief of human suffering.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
When the Superintendent saw Goldfinger and his party
approaching he hurried up.  'Dr Gold?' his face was
grave.  'I'm afraid the news coming through isn't too good.
Guess it'll all be in the papers tonight.  All trains held at
Louisville, no reply from the depot at Fort Knox.  But
we'll get you through all right.  God Almighty, Doctor!
What's going on down there?  People coming through
from Louisville are talking about the Russians spraying
something from the air.  Of course'—the Superintendent
looked keenly at Goldfinger—'I'm not believing that kind
of stuff.  But what is it?  Food poisoning?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger's face was solemn.  He said in a kindly voice,
'My friend, that's what we've got to find out.  That's why
we're being rushed down.  If you want me to make a guess,
but mark you it's only a guess, it's a form of sleeping
sickness—trypanosomiasis we call it.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'That so?' the Superintendent was impressed by the
sound of the malady.  'Well, believe you me, Doctor,
we're all mighty proud of you and your folks of the
Emergency Force.'  He held out his hand, Goldfinger took
it.  'Best of luck, Doc; and now, if you'll get your men and
the nurses on board, I'll have this train on its way just as
quick as may be.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Thank you, Superintendent.  My colleagues and I will
not forget your services.'  Goldfinger gave a short bow.
His contingent moved on.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Board!'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond found himself in a Pullman with Tilly Masterton
across the aisle and the Koreans and Germans all around
them.  Goldfinger was in the front of the car talking
cheerfully with his satraps.  Miss Pussy Galore strolled by.  She
ignored the upturned face of Tilly Masterton but gave
Bond the usual searching glance.  There was a banging of
doors being closed.  Pussy Galore stopped and rested an
arm on the back of the seat in front of Bond.  She looked
down at him.  'Hullo, Handsome.  Long time no see.
Uncle doesn't seem to let you off the lead much.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said, 'Hullo, Beautiful.  That outfit suits you fine.
I'm feeling rather faint.  How about doing a bit of nursing?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The deep violet eyes examined him carefully.  She said
softly, 'You know what, Mister Bond?  I got a feeling
there's something phoney about you.  I got instincts, see?
Just what are you and that doll'—she jerked her head
back—'doing in this outfit?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'We do all the work.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The train began to move.  Pussy Galore straightened
herself.  She said, 'Mebbe you do.  But if any little thing
goes wrong with this caper, for my money it'll be
Handsome who knows why.  Get me?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
She didn't wait for Bond's answer, but moved on down
and joined the Chiefs of Staff meeting.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
It was a confused, busy night.  Appearances had to be
kept up before the inquisitive, sympathetic eyes of the
conductors.  Last-minute conferences up and down the
train had to wear the appearance of serious medical
conclaves—no cigar-smoking, no swearing, no spitting.
Jealousies and competition between the gangs had to be
kept under rigid control.  The cold superiority of the
Mafia, particularly vis-à-vis Jack Strap and his soft,
easy-living crowd from the West, might have led to gunplay if
the chiefs hadn't been ready for trouble and constantly on
the look-out for it.  All these minor psychological factors
had been foreseen by Goldfinger and prepared for.  The
women from the Cement Mixers were carefully segregated,
there was no drinking and the gang chiefs kept their men
occupied with further exact briefings, dummy exercises
with maps and lengthy discussions about their escape
plans with the gold.  There was casual spying on each
other's plans and Goldfinger was often called in to judge
who should have which routes to the Mexican border, to
the desert, to Canada.  To Bond it was amazing that a
hundred of the toughest crooks in America, on edge with
excitement and greed, could be kept as quiet as they were.
It was Goldfinger who had achieved the miracle.  Apart
from the calm, dangerous quality of the man, it was the
minuteness of the planning and the confidence he exuded
that calmed the battle nerves and created some sort of a
team-spirit among the rival mobs.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
As the iron gallop of the train stretched itself out through
the flat lands of Pennsylvania, gradually the passengers
fell into an uneasy, troubled sleep.  But not Goldfinger or
Oddjob.  They remained awake and watchful and soon
Bond gave up any idea he might have had of using one of
his hidden knives on Oddjob and making a bid for
freedom when the train slowed through a station or on an up-gradient.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond dozed fitfully, wondering, imagining, puzzling
over the Superintendent's words.  The Superintendent had
certainly thought they were the truth, knew that Fort
Knox was in emergency.  Was his news from Louisville the
truth or part of the giant cover plan that would be necessary
to get every member of the conspiracy in the bag?  If it
was a cover plan, how meticulously had it been prepared?
Would someone slip up?  Would there be some ghastly
bungle that would warn Goldfinger in time?  Or if the news
was true, if the poison had been successful, what did there
remain for Bond to do?
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond had made up his mind on one score.  Somehow,
in the excitement of H-Hour, he would get close to
Goldfinger and cut his throat with one of his hidden knives.
How much would that achieve apart from an act of
private vengeance?  Would Goldfinger's squad accept
another man's order to arm the warhead and fire it?
Who would be strong enough, cool enough to take over?
Mr Solo?  Probably.  The operation would perhaps be half
successful, they would get away with plenty of
gold—except Goldfinger's men who would be lost without him
to lead them.  And in the meantime, whatever else Bond
could now do, had sixty thousand people already died?
Was there anything he could have done to prevent that?
Had there ever been a chance to kill Goldfinger?  Would it
have done any good to make a scene at Pennsylvania
Station?  Bond stared at his dark reflection in the window,
listened to the sweet ting of the grade-crossing bells and
the howl of the windhorn clearing their way, and shredded
his nerves with doubts, questions, reproaches.

CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE
<br class="calibre6"/>
THE RICHEST MAN IN HISTORY
</h3>

<p class="calibre4">
Slowly the red dawn broke over the endless plain
black grass that gradually turned to the famous
Kentucky blue as the sun ironed out the shadows.  At
six o'clock the train began to slacken speed and soon they
were gliding gently through the waking suburbs of
Louisville to come to rest with a sigh of hydraulics in the
echoing, almost deserted station.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
A small, respectful group was awaiting them.  Goldfinger,
his eyes black-ringed with lack of sleep, beckoned to
one of the Germans, picked up his authoritative little
black bag and stepped down on to the platform.  There
was a short, serious conclave, the Louisville Superintendent
doing the talking and Goldfinger interjecting a few
questions and nodding gravely at the answers.  Goldfinger
turned wearily back to the train.  Mr Solo had been
deputed to take his report.  He stood at the open door at
the end of the Pullman.  Bond heard Goldfinger say
sorrowfully, 'I am afraid, Doctor, the situation is as bad
as we feared.  I will now go forward to the leading diesel
with this,' he held up the black bag, 'and we will proceed
slowly into the infected area.  Would you please tell all
personnel to be prepared to put on their masks?  I have
masks for the driver and fireman.  All other railway
personnel will leave the train here.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Solo nodded solemnly.  'Right, Professor.'  He
closed his door.  Goldfinger walked off down the platform
followed by his German strong-arm man and the respectful,
head-shaking group.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There was a short pause and then silently, almost
reverently, the long train whispered its way out of the
station leaving the little group of officials, now reinforced
by four rather shamefaced conductors, with hands raised
in benediction.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Thirty-five miles, half an hour, to go!  Coffee and
doughnuts were brought round by the nurses, and
(Goldfinger thought of everything) for those whose nerves
needed it, two grains of dexedrine.  The nurses were pale,
silent.  There were no jokes, no smart remarks.  The train
was electric with tension.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
After ten minutes there was a sudden slackening of
speed and a sharp hiss from the brakes.  Coffee was spilled.
The train almost stopped.  Then there was a jerk and it
gathered speed again.  A new hand had taken over on the
dead man's handle.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
A few minutes later, Mr Strap came hurrying through
the train.  'Ten minutes to go!  On your toes, folks!  Squads
A, B and C get their equipment on.  Everything's going
fine.  Stay calm.  Remember your duties.'  He hurried
through to the next compartment and Bond heard the
voice repeating its message.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond turned to Oddjob.  'Listen, you ape, I'm going to
the lavatory and probably Miss Masterton will too.'  He
turned to the girl.  'What about it, Tilly?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes,' she said indifferently, 'I suppose I'd better.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said, 'Well, go ahead.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The Korean beside the girl looked inquiringly at
Oddjob.  Oddjob shook his head.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said, 'Unless you leave her alone I'm going to
start a fight.  Goldfinger won't like that.'  He turned to the
girl.  'Go ahead, Tilly.  I'll see to these apes.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Oddjob uttered a series of barks and snarls which the
other Korean seemed to understand.  The guard got up
and said, 'Okay, but not locking the door.'  He followed
the girl down the Pullman and stood and waited for her to
come out.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Oddjob carried out the same routine with Bond.  Once
inside, Bond took off his right shoe, slid out the knife and
slipped it down inside the waist-band of his trousers.  One
shoe would now have no heel, but no one was going to
notice that this morning.  Bond washed himself.  The face
in the mirror was pale and the blue-grey eyes dark with
tension.  He went out and back to his seat.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Now there was a distant shimmer away to the right and
a hint of low buildings rising like a mirage in the early
morning ground-mist.  They slowly defined themselves as
hangars with a squat control tower.  Godman Field!  The
soft pounding howl of the train slackened.  Some trim
modern villas, part of a new housing development, slid by.
They seemed to be unoccupied.  Now, on the left, there
was the black ribbon of Brandenburg Station Road.  Bond
craned.  The gleaming modern sprawl of Fort Knox looked
almost soft in the light mist.  Above its jagged outline the air
was clear as crystal—not a trace of smoke, no breakfasts
cooking!  The train slowed to a canter.  On Station Road
there had been a bad motor accident.  Two cars seemed to
have met head on.  The body of a man sprawled half out of
a smashed door.  The other car lay on its back like a dead
beetle.  Bond's heart pounded.  The main signal box came
and went.  Over the levers something white was draped.
It was a man's shirt.  Inside the shirt the body hung down,
its head below the level of the window.  A row of modern
bungalows.  A body clad in singlet and trousers flat on its
face in the middle of a trim lawn.  The lines of mown grass
were beautifully exact until, near the man, the mower
had written an ugly flourish and had then come to rest on
its side in the newly turned earth of the border.  A line of
washing that had broken when the woman had grasped it.
The woman lay in a white pile at one end of the sagging
string of family underclothes, cloths and towels.  And now
the train was moving at walking pace into the town and
everywhere, down every street, on every sidewalk, there
were the sprawling figures—singly, in clumps, in rocking-chairs
on the porches, in the middle of intersections where
the traffic lights still unhurriedly ticked off their coloured
signals, in cars that had managed to pull up and in others
that had smashed into shop windows.  Death!  Dead people
everywhere.  No movement, no sound save the click of
the murderer's iron feet as his train slid through the
graveyard.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Now there was bustle in the carriages.  Billy Ring came
through grinning hugely.  He stopped by Bond's chair.
'Oh boy!' he said delightedly, 'old Goldie certainly slipped
them the Micky Finn!  Too bad some people were out for a
ride when they got hit.  But you know what they say about
omelettes: can't make 'em without you break some eggs,
right?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond smiled tightly.  'That's right.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Billy Ring made his silent O of a laugh and went on his way.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The train trundled through Brandenburg Station.
Now there were scores of bodies—men, women, children,
soldiers.  The platform was scribbled with them, faces
upwards to the roof, down in the dust, cradled sideways.
Bond searched for movement, for an inquisitive eye, for a
twitching hand.  Nothing!  Wait!  What was that?  Thinly
through the closed window there came a soft, mewing wail.
Three perambulators stood against the ticket office, the
mothers collapsed beside them.  Of course!  The babies in
the perambulators would have drunk milk, not the deadly
water.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Oddjob got to his feet.  So did the whole of Goldfinger's
team.  The faces of the Koreans were indifferent,
unchanged, only their eyes flickered constantly like nervous
animals.  The Germans were pale, grim.  Nobody looked at
anyone else.  Silently they filed towards the exit and lined
up, waiting.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Tilly Masterton touched Bond's sleeve.  Her voice
trembled.  'Are you sure they're only asleep?  I thought I
saw some sort of ... sort of froth on some of the lips.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond had seen the same thing.  The froth had been pink.
He said, 'I expect some of them were eating sweets or
something when they fell asleep.  You know what these
Americans are—always chewing something.'  He softly
mouthed the next words.  'Stay away from me.  There
may be shooting.'  He looked hard at her to see she
understood.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
She nodded dumbly, not looking at him.  She whispered
out of the corner of her mouth, 'I'm going to get near
Pussy.  She'll look after me.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond gave her a smile and said 'Good', encouragingly.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The train clicked slowly over some points and slid to
rest.  There came one blast of the diesel's windhorn.  The
doors swung open and the different groups piled out on to
the platform of the Bullion Depository siding.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Now everything went with military precision.  The
various squads formed up in their battle order—first an
assault group with sub-machine guns, then the stretcher-bearers
to get the guard and other personnel out of the
vault (surely an unnecessary refinement now, thought
Bond) then Goldfinger's demolition team—ten men with
their bulky tarpaulin-covered package—then a mixed
group of spare drivers and traffic-control men, then the
group of nurses, now all armed with pistols, who were to
stay in the background with a heavily armed reserve group
that was to deal with any unexpected interference from
anybody who, as Goldfinger had put it, 'might wake up'.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond and the girl had been included in the Command
Group which consisted of Goldfinger, Oddjob and the five
gang leaders.  They were to be stationed on the flat roofs of
the two diesel locomotives which now stood, as planned,
beyond the siding buildings and in full view of the
objective and its approaches.  Bond and the girl were to handle
the maps, the timetables and the stop-watch, and Bond
was to watch out for fumbles and delays and bring them
at once to Goldfinger's attention to be rectified by
walkie-talkie with the squad leaders.  When the bomb was due to
be fired, they would take shelter behind the diesels.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There came a double blast from the windhorn and, as
Bond and the girl climbed to their position on the roof of
the first diesel, the assault squad, followed by the other
sections, doubled across the twenty yards of open ground
between the railway and Bullion Boulevard.  Bond edged
as close as he could to Goldfinger.  Goldfinger had
binoculars to his eyes.  His mouth was close to the
microphone strapped to his chest.  But Oddjob stood between
them, a solid mountain of flesh, and his eyes, uninterested
in the drama of the assault, never flickered from Bond and
the girl.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond, under cover of scanning his plastic map-case and
keeping an eye on the stop-watch, measured inches and
angles.  He glanced at the next-door group of the four men
and the woman.  They were gazing, in frozen attention, at
the scene before them.  Now Jack Strap said excitedly,
'They're through the first gates.'  Bond, putting half his
mind to work on his own plans, took a quick look at the
battlefield.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
It was an extraordinary scene.  In the centre stood the
huge squat mausoleum, the sun glinting off the polished
granite of its walls.  Outside the big open field in which it
stood, the roads—the Dixie Highway, Vine Grove and
Bullion Boulevard—were lined with trucks and transporters
two deep with the recognition flags of the gangs
flying from the first and last vehicle of each convoy.  Their
drivers lay piled up outside the shelter of the surrounding
guard wall of the vault while, through the main gate,
poured the tidy disciplined squads from the train.  Outside
this world of movement there was absolute stillness and
silence as if the rest of America was holding its breath at
the committal of this gigantic crime.  And outside lay the
bodies of the soldiers, sprawling where they had fallen—the
sentries by their pill boxes, still clutching their
automatic pistols, and, inside the protecting wall, two ragged
squads of soldiers in battle-dress.  They lay in vague,
untidy heaps, some bodies athwart or on top of their
neighbours.  Outside, between Bullion Boulevard and the main
gate, two armoured cars had crashed into each other and
now stood locked, their heavy machine guns pointing,
one at the ground and the other at the sky.  A driver's body
sprawled out of the turret of one of the vehicles.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Desperately Bond looked for a sign of life, a sign of
movement, a hint that all this was a careful ambush.
Nothing!  Not a cat moved, not a sound came out of the
crowded buildings that formed a backdrop to the scene.
Only the squads hurried about their tasks or now stood
waiting in their planned dispositions.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger spoke quietly into his microphone.  'Last
stretcher out.  Bomb squad ready.  Prepare to take cover.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Now the covering troops and the stretcher-bearers were
hurrying for the exit, getting down under cover of the
guard wall.  There would be five minutes' delay to clear
the area before the bomb squad, now waiting bunched at
the main gate, would go in.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said efficiently, 'They're a minute ahead of time.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger looked past Oddjob's shoulder.  The pale
eyes were aflame.  They stared into Bond's.  Goldfinger's
mouth twisted into a harsh snarl.  He said through his
teeth, 'You see, Mr Bond.  You were wrong and I was
right.  Ten more minutes and I shall be the richest man in
the world, the richest man in history!  What do you say to
that?'  His mouth spat out the words.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said equably, 'I'll tell you after those ten minutes
are up.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Will you?' said Goldfinger.  'Maybe.'  He looked at his
watch and spoke rapidly into his microphone.  The
Goldfinger squad loped slowly through the main gate, their
heavy burden slung from four shoulders in a cradle of
webbing.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger looked past Bond at the group on the roof of
the second diesel.  He called out triumphantly, 'Another
five minutes, gentlemen, and then we must take cover.'  He
turned his eyes on Bond and added softly, 'And then we
will say goodbye, Mr Bond.  And thank you for the
assistance you and the girl have given me.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Out of the corner of his eye, Bond saw something
moving—moving in the sky.  It was a black, whirling speck.  It
reached the top of its trajectory, paused and then came
the ear-splitting crack of a maroon signal.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond's heart leapt.  A quick glance showed him the
ranks of dead soldiers springing to life, the machine guns
on the locked armoured cars swinging to cover the gates.  A
loud-speaker roared from nowhere, 'Stand where you are.
Lay down your arms.'  But there came a futile crackle of
fire from one of the rearguard covering party and then all
hell broke loose.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond seized the girl round the waist and jumped with
her.  It was a ten-foot drop to the platform.  Bond broke his
fall with his left hand and hoisted the girl to her feet with
a jerk of his hip.  As he began to run, close to the train for
cover, he heard Goldfinger shout, 'Get them and kill
them.'  A splatter of lead from Goldfinger's automatic
whipped at the cement to his left.  But Goldfinger would
have to shoot left-handed.  It was Oddjob that Bond feared.
Now, as Bond tore down the platform with the girl's hand
in his, he heard the lightning scuffle of the running feet.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The girl's hand tugged at him.  She screamed angrily,
'No, No.  Stop!  I want to stay close to Pussy.  I'll be safe
with her.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond shouted back, 'Shut up, you little fool!  Run like
hell!'  But now she was dragging at him, checking his
speed.  Suddenly she tore her hand out of his and made to
dart into an open Pullman door.  Christ, thought Bond,
that's torn it!  He whipped the knife out of his belt and
swirled to meet Oddjob.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Ten yards away Oddjob hardly paused in his rush.  One
hand whipped off his ridiculous, deadly hat, a glance to
take aim and the black steel half-moon sang through the
air.  Its edge caught the girl exactly at the nape of the
neck.  Without a sound she fell backwards on to the
platform in Oddjob's path.  The hurdle was just enough to put
Oddjob off the flying high kick he had started to launch
at Bond's head.  He turned the kick into a leap, his left
hand cutting the air towards Bond like a sword.  Bond
ducked and struck upwards and sideways with his knife.
It got home somewhere near the ribs but the momentum
of the flying body knocked the knife out of his hand.  There
was a tinkle on the platform.  Now Oddjob was coming
back at him, apparently unharmed, his hands outstretched
and his feet splayed back ready for another leap or a kick.
His blood was up.  The eyes were red and there was a
fleck of saliva at the open, panting mouth.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Above the boom and rattle of the guns outside the
station, three blasts sounded on the diesel's windhorn.
Oddjob snarled angrily and leapt.  Bond dived at full
length sideways.  Something hit him a gigantic blow on the
shoulder and sent him sprawling.  Now, he thought as he
hit the ground, now the death stroke!  He scrambled
clumsily to his feet, his neck hunched into his shoulders
to break the impact.  But no blow came and Bond's dazed
eyes took in the figure of Oddjob flying away from him up
the platform.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Already the leading diesel was on the move.  Oddjob got
to it and leapt for the footplate.  For a moment he hung, his
legs scrabbling for a foothold.  Then he had disappeared
into the cabin and the huge streamlined engine gathered
speed.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Behind Bond the door of the quartermaster's office
burst open.  There was the hammer of running feet and a
yell 'Santiago!'—St James, the battle-cry of Cortez that
Leiter had once jokingly allotted to Bond.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond swivelled.  The straw-haired Texan, clad in his
war-time Marine Corps battle-dress, was pounding up the
platform followed by a dozen men in khaki.  He carried a
one-man bazooka by the steel hook he used for a right
hand.  Bond ran to meet him.  He said, 'Don't shoot my
fox, you bastard.  Give over.'  He snatched the bazooka out
of Leiter's hand and threw himself down on the platform,
splaying out his legs.  Now the diesel was two hundred
yards away and about to cross the bridge over the Dixie
Highway.  Bond shouted 'Stand clear!' to get the men out
of line of the recoil flash, clicked up the safe and took
careful aim.  The bazooka shuddered slightly and the
ten-pound armour-piercing rocket was on its way.  There was
a flash and a puff of blue smoke.  Some bits of metal flew
off the rear of the flying engine.  But then it had crossed the
bridge and taken the curve and was away.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Not bad for a rookie,' commented Leiter.  'May put the
rear diesel out, but those jobs are twins and he can make it
on the forward engine.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond got to his feet.  He smiled warmly into the hawk-like,
slate-grey eyes.  'You bungling oaf,' he said sarcastically,
'why in hell didn't you block that line?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Listen, shamus.  If you've got any complaints about the
stage management you can tell them to the President.  He
took personal command of this operation and it's a honey.
There's a spotter plane overhead now.  They'll pick up the
diesel and we'll have old Goldilocks in the hoosegow by
midday.  How were we to know he was going to stay
aboard the train?'  He broke off and thumped Bond
between the shoulder-blades.  'Hell, I'm glad to see you.
These men and I were detailed off to give you protection.
We've been dodging around looking for you and getting
shot at by both sides for our pains.'  He turned to the
soldiers.  'Ain't that right, men?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
They laughed.  'Sure is, Cap'n.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond looked affectionately at the Texan with whom he
had shared so many adventures.  He said seriously, 'Bless
you, Felix.  You've always been good at saving my life.  It
was darn nearly too late this time.  I'm afraid Tilly
Masterton's had it.'  He walked off up the train with Felix
at his heels.  The little figure still lay sprawled where she
had fallen.  Bond knelt beside her.  The broken-doll angle
of the head was enough.  He felt for her pulse.  He got up.
He said softly, 'Poor little bitch.  She didn't think much of
men.'  He looked defensively at Leiter.  'Felix, I could have
got her away if she'd only followed me.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Leiter didn't understand.  He put his hand on Bond's
arm and said, 'Sure kid.  Take it easy.'  He turned to his
men.  'Two of you carry the girl into the Q-M.'s office
over there.  O'Brien, you go for the ambulance.  When
you've done that, stop over at the Command post and
give 'em the facts.  Say we've got Commander Bond and
I'll bring him right over.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond stood and looked down at the little empty tangle
of limbs and clothes.  He saw the bright, proud girl with the
spotted handkerchief round her hair in the flying TR3.
Now she had gone.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
High up over his head a whirling speck soared into the
sky.  It reached the top of its flight and paused.  There came
the sharp crack of the maroon.  It was the cease-fire.

CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO
<br class="calibre6"/>
THE LAST TRICK
</h3>

<p class="calibre4">
It was two days later.  Felix Leiter was weaving the
black Studillac fast through the lanes of dawdling
traffic on the Triborough bridge.  There was plenty of
time to catch Bond's plane, the evening B.O.A.C. Monarch
to London, but Leiter enjoyed shaking up Bond's low
opinion of American cars.  Now the steel hook that he
used for a right hand banged the gear lever into second
and the low black car leapt for a narrow space between a
giant refrigerator truck and a mooning Oldsmobile whose
rear window was almost obscured by holiday stickers.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond's body jerked back with the kick of the 300
b.h.p. and his teeth snapped shut.  When the manoeuvre
was completed, and the angry hooting had vanished
behind them, Bond said mildly, 'It's time you graduated
out of the Kiddicar class and bought yourself an express
carriage.  You want to get cracking.  This pedalling along
ages one.  One of these days you'll stop moving altogether
and when you stop moving is when you start to die.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Leiter laughed.  He said, 'See that green light ahead?
Bet I can make it before it goes red.'  The car leapt forward
as if it had been kicked.  There was a brief hiatus in Bond's
life, an impression of snipe-like flight and of a steel wall of
cars that somehow parted before the whiplash of Leiter's
triple klaxons, a hundred yards when the speedometer
touched ninety and they were across the lights and
cruising genteelly along in the centre lane.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said calmly, 'You meet the wrong traffic cop and
that Pinkerton card of yours won't be good enough.  It
isn't so much that you drive slowly, it's holding back the
cars behind they'll book you for.  The sort of car you need
is a nice elderly Rolls Royce Silver Ghost with big
plate-glass windows so you can enjoy the beauties of
nature'—Bond gestured towards a huge automobile junk heap on
their right.  'Maximum fifty and it can stop and even go
backwards if you want to.  Bulb horn.  Suit your sedate
style.  Matter of fact there should be one on the market
soon—Goldfinger's.  And by the same token, what the
hell's happened to Goldfinger?  Haven't they caught up
with him yet?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Leiter glanced at his watch and edged into the outside
lane.  He brought the car down to forty.  He said seriously,
'Tell you the truth, we're all a bit worried.  The papers are
needling us, or rather Edgar Hoover's crowd, like hell.
First they had a gripe at the security clamp-down on you.
We couldn't tell them that wasn't our fault and that
someone in London, an old limey called M, had insisted on it.
So they're getting their own back.  Say we're dragging our
feet and so forth.  And I'm telling you, James'—Leiter's
voice was glum, apologetic—'we just haven't a clue.
They caught up with the diesel.  Goldfinger had fixed
the controls at thirty and had let it run on down the
line.  Somewhere he and the Korean had got off and
probably this Galore girl and the four hoods as well because
they've vanished too.  We found his truck convoy, of
course, waiting on the eastbound highway out of Elizabethville.
But never a driver.  Most probably scattered, but
somewhere there's Goldfinger and a pretty tough team
hiding up.  They didn't get to the <i class="calibre3">Sverdlovsk</i> cruiser at
Norfolk.  We had a plain-clothes guard scattered round the
docks and they report that she sailed to schedule without
any strangers going aboard.  Not a cat's been near that
warehouse on East River and no one's shown at Idlewild
or the frontiers—Mexico and Canada.  For my money,
that Jed Midnight has somehow got them out to Cuba.  If
they'd taken two or three trucks from the convoy and
driven like hell they could have got down to Florida,
somewhere like Daytona Beach, by the early hours of
D+1.  And Midnight's darn well organized down there.
The Coast Guards and the Air Force have put out all
they've got, but nothing's shown yet.  But they could have
hidden up during the day and got over to Cuba during
the night.  It's got everybody worried as hell and it's no
help that the President's hopping mad.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond had spent the previous day in Washington
treading the thickest, richest red carpet.  There had been
speeches at the Bureau of the Mint, a big brass lunch at the
Pentagon, an embarrassing quarter of an hour with the
President, and the rest of the day had been hard work with
a team of stenographers in Edgar Hoover's suite of offices
with a colleague of Bond's from Station A sitting in.  At
the end of that, there had been a brisk quarter of an hour's
talk with M on the Embassy transatlantic scrambler.  M
had told him what had been happening on the European
end of the case.  As Bond had expected, Goldfinger's cable
to Universal Export had been treated as emergency.  The
factories at Reculver and Coppet had been searched and
extra evidence of the gold-smuggling racket had been
found.  The Indian Government had been warned about
the Mecca plane that was already en route for Bombay
and that end of the operation was on the way to being
cleaned up.  The Swiss Special Brigade had quickly found
Bond's car and had got on to the route by which Bond and
the girl had been taken to America, but there, at Idlewild,
the F.B.I. had lost the scent.  M seemed pleased with the
way Bond had handled Operation Grand Slam, but he
said the Bank of England were worrying him about
Goldfinger's twenty million pounds in gold.  Goldfinger had
assembled all this at the Paragon Safe Deposit Co in New
York but had withdrawn it on D-1.  He and his men had
driven it away in a covered truck.  The Bank of England
had ready an Order in Council to impound the gold when
it was found and there would then be a case to prove that
it had been smuggled out of England, or at least that it was
originally smuggled gold whose value had been increased
by various doubtful means.  But this was now being handled
by the U.S. Treasury and the F.B.I. and, since M had no
jurisdiction in America, Bond had better come home at
once and help tidy things up.  Oh yes—at the end of the
conversation M's voice had sounded gruff—there had
been a very kind request to the P.M. that Bond should be
allowed to accept the American Medal of Merit.  Of course
M had had to explain via the P.M. that the Service didn't
go in for those sort of things—particularly from foreign
countries, however friendly they were.  Too bad, but M
knew that this was what Bond would have expected.  He
knew the rules.  Bond had said yes of course and thank you
very much and he'd take the next plane home.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Now, as they motored quietly down the Van Wyck
Expressway, Bond was feeling vaguely dissatisfied.  He
didn't like leaving ragged ends to a case.  None of the big
gangsters had been put in the bag and he had failed in the
two tasks he had been given, to get Goldfinger and get
Goldfinger's bullion.  It was nothing but a miracle that
Operation Grand Slam had been broken.  It had been two
days before the Beechcraft had been serviced and the
cleaner who found the note had got to Pinkerton's only
half an hour before Leiter was due to go off to the Coast on
a big racing scandal.  But then Leiter had really got
cracking—to his chief, then to the F.B.I. and the Pentagon.
The F.B.I.'s knowledge of Bond's record, plus contact
with M through the Central Intelligence Agency, had
been enough to get the whole case up to the President
within an hour.  After that it had just been a case of
building up the gigantic bluff in which all the inhabitants of
Fort Knox had participated in one way or another.  The
two 'Japanese' had been taken easily enough and it was
confirmed by Chemical Warfare that the three pints of
GB carried as gin in their briefcases would have been
enough to slay the entire population of Fort Knox.  The
two men had been quickly and forcibly grilled into
explaining the form of the all-clear cable to Goldfinger.
The cable had been sent.  Then the Army had declared
emergency.  Road and rail and air blocks had turned back
all traffic to the Fort Knox area with the exception of the
gangster convoys which had not been hindered.  The rest
was play-acting right down to the pink froth and the
squalling babies which it was thought would add nice
touches of verisimilitude.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Yes, it had all been very satisfactory so far as Washington
was concerned, but what about the English end?  Who
in America cared about the Bank of England's gold?  Who
cared that two English girls had been murdered in the
course of this business?  Who really minded that Goldfinger
was still at liberty now that America's bullion was safe
again?
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
They idled across the drab plain of Idlewild, past the
ten-million-dollar steel and cement skeletons that would
one day be an adult airport, and pulled up outside the
makeshift huddle of concrete boxes that Bond knew so
well.  Already the well-mannered iron voices were reaching
out to them.  'Pan American World Airways announces
the departure of its President Flight PA 100',
'Trans-world Airways calling Captain Murphy.  Captain Murphy,
please.'  And the pear-shaped vowels and fluted diction of
B.O.A.C., 'B.O.A.C. announces the arrival of its
Bermudan Flight BA 491.  Passengers will be disembarking at
gate number neyne.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond took his bag and said goodbye to Leiter.  He said,
'Well, thanks for everything, Felix.  Write to me every day.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Leiter gripped his hand hard.  He said, 'Sure thing, kid.
And take it easy.  Tell that old bastard M to send you back
over soon.  Next visit we'll take some time off from the
razzmatazz.  Time you called in on my home state.  Like to
have you meet my oil-well.  'Bye now.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Leiter got into his car and accelerated away from the
arrival bay.  Bond raised his hand.  The Studillac
dry-skidded out on to the approach road.  There was an
answering glint from Leiter's steel hook out of the window
and he was gone.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond sighed.  He picked up his bag and walked in and
over to the B.O.A.C. ticket counter.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond didn't mind airports so long as he was alone in
them.  He had half an hour to wait and he was quite
content to wander through the milling crowds, have a
bourbon and soda at the restaurant and spend some time
choosing something to read at the bookstore.  He bought
Ben Hogan's <i class="calibre3">Modern Fundamentals of Golf</i> and the latest
Raymond Chandler and sauntered along to the Souvenir
Shop to see if he could find an amusing gimmick to take
back to his secretary.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Now there was a man's voice on the B.O.A.C. announcing
system.  It called out a long list of Monarch passengers
who were required at the ticket counter.  Ten minutes later
Bond was paying for one of the latest and most expensive
ball-point pens when he heard his own name being called.
'Will Mr James Bond, passenger on B.O.A.C. Monarch
flight No. 510 to Gander and London, please come to the
B.O.A.C. ticket counter.  Mr James Bond, please.'  It was
obviously that infernal tax form to show how much he had
earned during his stay in America.  On principle Bond
never went to the Internal Revenue Office in New York to
get clearance and he had only once had to argue it out at
Idlewild.  He went out of the shop and across to the
B.O.A.C. counter.  The official said politely, 'May I see
your health certificate, please, Mr Bond?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond took the form out of his passport and handed it over.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The man looked at it carefully.  He said, 'I'm very sorry,
sir, but there's been a typhoid case at Gander and they're
insisting that all transit passengers who haven't had their
shots in the last six months should be topped up.  It's most
annoying, sir, but Gander's very touchy about these
things.  Too bad we couldn't have managed a direct flight,
but there's a strong head-wind.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond hated inoculations.  He said irritably, 'But look
here, I'm stuffed with shots of one kind or another.  Been
having them for twenty years for one damned thing or
another!'  He looked round.  The area near the B.O.A.C. departure
gate seemed curiously deserted.  He said, 'What
about the other passengers?  Where are they?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'They've all agreed, sir.  Just having their shots now.
It won't take a minute, sir, if you'll come this way.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Oh well.'  Bond shrugged his shoulders impatiently.
He followed the man behind the counter and through a
door to the B.O.A.C. station manager's office.  There was
the usual white-clothed doctor, a mask over the bottom
of his face, the needle held ready.  'Last one?' he asked of
the B.O.A.C. official.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes, Doctor.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Okay.  Coat off and left sleeve up, please.  Too bad
they're so sensitive up at Gander.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Damned sight too bad,' said Bond.  'What are they
afraid of?  Spreading the black death?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There came the sharp smell of the alcohol and the jab of
the needle.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Thanks,' said Bond gruffly.  He pulled down his sleeve
and made to pick his coat up from the back of the chair.
His hand went down for it, missed it, went on down, down
towards the floor.  His body dived after the hand, down,
down, down...
</p>

<p class="calibre4"><br class="calibre1"/></p>

<p class="calibre4">
All the lights were on in the plane.  There seemed to be
plenty of spare places.  Why did he have to get stuck with
a passenger whose arm was hogging the central arm-rest.
Bond made to get up and change his seat.  A wave of
nausea swept over him.  He closed his eyes and waited.
How extraordinary!  He was never air-sick.  He felt the
cold sweat on his face.  Handkerchief.  Wipe it off.  He
opened his eyes again and looked down at his arms.  The
wrists were bound to the arms of his chair.  What had
happened?  He had had his shot and then passed out or something.
Had he got violent?  What the hell was all this about?
He glanced to his right and then stared, aghast.  Oddjob
was sitting there.  Oddjob!  Oddjob in B.O.A.C. uniform!
Oddjob glanced incuriously at him and reached for the
steward's bell.  Bond heard the pretty ding-dong back in
the pantry.  There was the rustle of a skirt beside him.  He
looked up.  It was Pussy Galore, trim and fresh in the
blue uniform of a stewardess!  She said, 'Hi, Handsome.'  She
gave him the deep, searching look he remembered so
well from when?  From centuries ago, in another life.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said desperately, 'For Christ's sake, what's going
on?  Where did you come from?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The girl smiled cheerfully, 'Eating caviar and drinking
champagne.  You Britishers sure live the life of Reilly when
you get up twenty thousand feet.  Not a sign of a Brussels
sprout and if there's tea I haven't got around to it yet.
Now, you take it easy.  Uncle wants to talk to you.'  She
sauntered up the aisle, swinging her hips, and disappeared
through the cockpit door.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Now nothing could surprise Bond.  Goldfinger, in a
B.O.A.C. captain's uniform that was rather too large for
him, the cap squarely on the centre of his head, closed
the cockpit door behind him and came down the aisle.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
He stood and looked grimly down at Bond.  'Well, Mr
Bond.  So Fate wished us to play the game out.  But this
time, Mr Bond, there cannot possibly be a card up your
sleeve.  Ha!'  The sharp bark was a mixture of anger,
stoicism and respect.  'You certainly turned out to be a
snake in my pastures.'  The great head shook slowly.  'Why
I kept you alive!  Why I didn't crush you like a beetle!
You and the girl were useful to me.  Yes, I was right about
that.  But I was mad to have taken the chance.  Yes, mad.'  The
voice dropped and went slow.  'And now tell me, Mr
Bond.  How did you do it?  How did you communicate?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said equably, 'We will have a talk, Goldfinger.  And
I will tell you certain things.  But not until you have taken
off these straps and brought me a bottle of bourbon, ice,
soda water and a packet of Chesterfields.  Then, when you
have told me what I wish to know, I will decide what to
tell you.  As you say, my situation is not favourable, or at
least it doesn't appear to be.  So I have nothing to lose and
if you want to get something out of me it will be on my
own terms.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger looked gravely down.  'I have no objection
to your conditions.  Out of respect for your abilities as an
opponent, you shall spend your last journey in comfort.
Oddjob'—the voice was sharp.  'Ring the bell for Miss
Galore and undo those straps.  Get into the seat in front.
There is no harm he can do at the rear of the plane but he
is not to approach the cockpit door.  If need be, kill him at
once, but I prefer to get him to our destination alive.
Understood?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Arrgh.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Five minutes later Bond had what he wanted.  The tray
in front of him was down and on it were his whisky and
cigarettes.  He poured himself a stiff bourbon.  Goldfinger
was seated in the chair across the aisle, waiting.  Bond
picked up his drink and sipped it.  He was about to take
a deeper drink when he saw something.  He put the glass
carefully down without disturbing the little round paper
coaster that had stuck to the bottom of his glass.  He lit a
cigarette, picked up his drink again and removed the
ice-cubes and put them back in the ice bucket.  He drank the
whisky down almost to the end.  Now he could read the
words through the bottom of the glass.  He carefully put
the glass down without disturbing the coaster.  The
message had read, 'I'm with you.  XXX.  P.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond turned and made himself comfortable.  He said,
'Now then, Goldfinger.  First of all, what's going on, how
did you get this plane, where are we heading?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger crossed one leg over the other.  He gazed
away from Bond, up the aisle.  He said in a relaxed,
conversational tone, 'I took three trucks and drove across
country to the vicinity of Cape Hatteras.  One of the
trucks contained my personal hoard of gold bullion.  The
other two contained my drivers, spare personnel and those
gangsters.  I required none of them except Miss Galore.  I
kept a nucleus of the staff I would need, paid off the others
with huge sums and dispersed them gradually along the
route.  At the coast I held a meeting with the four gang
leaders in a deserted place, having left Miss Galore
under some pretext with the trucks.  I shot the four men
in my usual fashion—one bullet for each.  I went back
to the trucks and explained that the four men had chosen
money and independent action.  I was now left with six
men, the girl and the bullion.  I hired a plane and flew
to Newark, New Jersey, the crates of gold being passed
off as lead for X-ray plates.  From there I proceeded
alone to a certain address in New York from which
I talked with Moscow by radio and explained the
mishap to Operation Grand Slam.  In the course of the
talk I mentioned your name.  My friends, whom I believe
you know,' Goldfinger looked hard at Bond, 'pass under
the generic name of SMERSH.  They recognized the name of
Bond and told me who you were.  I at once understood a
great deal of what had previously been hidden from me.
SMERSH said they would greatly like to interview you.  I
pondered the matter.  In due course I conceived the plan
which you now see in operation.  Posing as a friend of yours,
I had no difficulty in finding out the flight on which you
were booked.  Three of my men were formerly of the
Luftwaffe.  They assured me there would be no difficulty in
flying this plane.  The rest was mere detail.  By cool
bluffing, impersonation and the use of a certain amount of
force, all the B.O.A.C. personnel at Idlewild, the crew of
this plane and the passengers were given the necessary
injections from which they will now be recovering.  We
changed clothes with the unconscious crew, the bullion
was loaded on the plane, you were dealt with and carried
out on a stretcher and in due course the new B.O.A.C. crew,
with their stewardess, boarded the plane and we
took to the air.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger paused.  He lifted a hand resignedly.  'Of
course there were small hitches.  We were told to "follow
taxiway Alpha to runway four", and it was only by following
a KLM plane that we were successful.  The Idlewild
routine was not easy to master and we must have seemed
somewhat clumsy and inexperienced, but, Mr Bond, with
assurance, strong nerves and a gruff, intimidating manner
it is never difficult to override the Civil Service mentality
of what, after all, are minor employees.  I understand from
the wireless operator that a search for this plane is under
way.  They were already questioning us before we were
out of VHF range at Nantucket.  Then the Distant Early
Warning system queried us on high frequency.  That did
not disturb me.  We have enough fuel.  We have already
had clearance from Moscow for East Berlin, Kiev or
Murmansk.  We shall take whichever route the weather
dictates.  There should be no trouble.  If there is, I shall
talk my way out of it on the radio.  No one is going to shoot
down a valuable B.O.A.C. plane.  The mystery and
confusion will protect us until we are well within Soviet
territory and then, of course, we shall have disappeared
without trace.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
To Bond there had been nothing fantastic, nothing
impossible about Goldfinger since he had heard the details
of Operation Grand Slam.  The theft of a Stratocruiser, as
Goldfinger had explained it, was preposterous, but no
more so than his methods of smuggling gold, his purchase
of an atomic warhead.  When one examined these things,
while they had a touch of magic, of genius even, they were
logical exercises.  They were bizarre only in their
magnitude.  Even the tiny manoeuvre of cheating Mr Du Pont
had been quite brilliantly contrived.  There was no doubt
about it, Goldfinger was an artist—a scientist in crime as
great in his field as Cellini or Einstein in theirs.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'And now, Mr Bond of the British Secret Service, we
made a bargain.  What have you to tell me?  Who put you
on to me?  What did they suspect?  How did you manage to
interfere with my plans?'  Goldfinger sat back, placed his
hands across his stomach and looked at the ceiling.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond gave Goldfinger a censored version of the truth.
He mentioned nothing about SMERSH or the location of the
post box and he said nothing about the secrets of the
Homer, a device that might be new to the Russians.  He
concluded, 'So you see, Goldfinger, you only just got
away.  But for Tilly Masterton's intervention at Geneva,
you'd have been in the bag by now.  You'd be sitting
picking your teeth in a Swiss prison waiting to be sent to
England.  You underestimate the English.  They may be
slow, but they get there.  You think you'll be pretty safe in
Russia?  I wouldn't be too sure.  We've got people even out
of there before now.  I'll give you one last aphorism for
your book, Goldfinger: "Never go a bear of England."'

CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE
<br class="calibre6"/>
T.L.C. TREATMENT
</h3>

<p class="calibre4">
The plane throbbed on, high above the weather, over
the great moonlit landscape.  The lights had been
turned out.  Bond sat quietly in the darkness and
sweated with fear at what he was going to do.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
An hour before, the girl had brought him dinner.  There
was a pencil hidden in the napkin.  She had made some
tough remarks for the benefit of Oddjob and gone away.
Bond had eaten some scraps of food and drunk a good deal
of bourbon while his imagination hunted round the plane
wondering what he could conceivably do to force an
emergency landing at Gander or somewhere else in Nova
Scotia.  As a last resort, could he set fire to the plane?  He
toyed with the idea, and with the possibility of forcing the
entrance hatch open.  Both ideas seemed impracticable
and suicidal.  To save him the trouble of pondering over
them, the man whom Bond had seen before at the
B.O.A.C. ticket counter, one of the Germans, came
through and stopped by Bond's chair.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
He grinned down at Bond.  'B.O.A.C. takes good care of
you, isn't it?  Mister Goldfinger thinks you might have
foolish notions.  I am to keep an eye on the rear of the
plane.  So just sit back and enjoy the ride, isn't it?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
When Bond didn't answer, the man went on back to the
rear section.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Something was nagging at Bond's mind, something
connected with his previous thoughts.  That business
about forcing the hatch.  Now what was it that had
happened to that plane, flying over Persia back in '57?  Bond
sat for a while and stared with wide, unseeing eyes at the
back of the seat in front of him.  It might work!  It just
conceivably might!
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond wrote on the inside of the napkin, 'I'll do my best.
Fasten your seat belt.  XXX.  J.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
When the girl came to take his tray Bond dropped the
napkin and then picked it up and handed it to her.  He
held her hand and smiled up into the searching eyes.  She
bent to pick up the tray.  She kissed him quickly on the
cheek.  She straightened herself.  She said toughly, 'I'll see
you in my dreams, Handsome,' and went off to the galley.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
And now Bond's mind was made up.  He had worked
out exactly what had to be done.  The inches had been
measured, the knife from his heel was under his coat and
he had twisted the longest end of his seat belt round his
left wrist.  All he needed was one sign that Oddjob's body
was turned away from the window.  It would be too much
to expect Oddjob to go to sleep, but at least he could make
himself comfortable.  Bond's eyes never left the dim profile
he could see reflected in the Perspex oblong of the window
of the seat in front, but Oddjob sat stolidly under the
reading light he had prudently kept burning, his eyes
staring at the ceiling, his mouth slightly open and his
hands held ready and relaxed on the arms of his chair.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
One hour, two hours.  Bond began to snore, rhythmically,
drowsily, he hoped hypnotically.  Now Oddjob's
hands had moved to his lap.  The head nodded once and
pulled itself up, shifted to get more comfortable, turned
away from the piercing eye of light in the wall, rested on
its left cheek away from the window!
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond kept his snores exactly even.  Getting under the
Korean's guard would be as difficult as getting past a
hungry mastiff.  Slowly, inch by inch, he crouched forward
on the balls of his feet and reached with his knife hand
between the wall and Oddjob's seat.  Now his hand was
there.  Now the needle-sharp tip of the dagger was aimed
at the centre of the square inch of Perspex he had chosen.
Bond grasped the end of his seat belt tightly in his hand,
drew the knife back two inches and lunged.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond had had no idea what would happen when he cut
through the window.  All he knew from the Press reports of
the Persian case was that the suction out of the pressurized
cabin had whirled the passenger next to the window out
through the window and into space.  Now, as he whipped
back his dagger, there was a fantastic howl, almost a
scream of air, and Bond was sucked violently against the
back of Oddjob's seat with a force that tore the end of the
seat belt from his hand.  Over the back of the seat he
witnessed a miracle.  Oddjob's body seemed to elongate
towards the howling black aperture.  There was a crash as
his head went through and his shoulders hit the frame.
Then, as if the Korean's body was toothpaste, it was
slowly, foot by foot, sucked with a terrible whistling noise
through the aperture.  Now Oddjob was out to his waist.
Now the huge buttocks stuck and the human paste moved
only inch by inch.  Then, with a loud boom, the buttocks
got through and the legs disappeared as if shot from a gun.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
After that came the end of the world.  With an appalling
crash of crockery from the galley, the huge plane stood on
its nose and dived.  The last thing Bond knew before he
blacked out was the high scream of the engines through
the open window and a fleeting vision of pillows and rugs
whipping out into space past his eyes.  Then, with a final
desperate embrace of the seat in front, Bond's
oxygen-starved body collapsed in a sear of lung-pain.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The next thing Bond felt was a hard kick in the ribs.
There was a taste of blood in his mouth.  He groaned.
Again the foot smashed into his body.  Painfully he dragged
himself to his knees between the seats and looked up
through a red film.  All the lights were on.  There was a
thin mist in the cabin.  The sharp depressurization had
brought the air in the cabin down below the dew-point.
The roar of the engines through the open window was
gigantic.  An icy wind seared him.  Goldfinger stood over
him, his face fiendish under the yellow light.  There was a
small automatic dead steady in his hand.  Goldfinger
reached back his foot and kicked again.  Bond lit with a
blast of hot rage.  He caught the foot and twisted it sharply,
almost breaking the ankle.  There came a scream from
Goldfinger and a crash that shook the plane.  Bond leapt
for the aisle and threw himself sideways and down on to
the heap of body.  There was an explosion that burned the
side of his face.  But then his knee thudded into Goldfinger's
groin and his left hand was over the gun.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
For the first time in his life, Bond went berserk.  With his
fists and knees he pounded the struggling body while
again and again he crashed his forehead down on to the
glistening face.  The gun came quavering towards him
again.  Almost indifferently Bond slashed sideways with
the edge of his hand and heard the clatter of metal among
the seats.  Now Goldfinger's hands were at his throat and
Bond's at Goldfinger's.  Down, down went Bond's thumbs
into the arteries.  He threw all his weight forward, gasping
for breath.  Would he black out before the other man died?
Would he?  Could he stand the pressure of Goldfinger's
strong hands?  The glistening moon-face was changing.
Deep purple showed through the tan.  The eyes began to
flicker up.  The pressure of the hands on Bond's throat
slackened.  The hands fell away.  Now the tongue came out
and lolled from the open mouth and there came a terrible
gargling from deep in the lungs.  Bond sat astride the
silent chest and slowly, one by one, unhinged his rigid
fingers.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond gave a deep sigh and knelt and then stood slowly
up.  Dazedly he looked up and down the lighted plane.  By
the galley, Pussy Galore lay strapped in her seat like a
heap of washing.  Farther down, in the middle of the aisle,
the guard lay spreadeagled, one arm and the head at
ridiculous angles.  Without a belt to hold him when the
plane dived, he must have been tossed at the roof like a
rag doll.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond brushed his hands over his face.  Now he felt the
burns on his palm and cheeks.  Wearily he went down on
his knees again and searched for the little gun.  It was a
Colt .25 automatic.  He flicked out the magazine.  Three
rounds left and one in the chamber.  Bond half walked,
half felt his way down the aisle to where the girl lay.  He
unbuttoned her jacket and put his hand against her warm
breast.  The heart fluttered like a pigeon under his palm.
He undid the seat belt and got the girl face down on the
floor and knelt astride her.  For five minutes he pumped
rhythmically at her lungs.  When she began to moan, he
got up and left her and went on down the aisle and took a
fully loaded Luger out of the dead guard's shoulder holster.
On the way back past the shambles of the galley he saw an
unbroken bottle of bourbon rolling gently to and fro
among the wreckage.  He picked it up and pulled the cork
and tilted it into his open mouth.  The liquor burned like
disinfectant.  He put the cork back and went forward.  He
stopped for a minute outside the cockpit door, thinking.
Then, with a gun in each hand, he knocked the lever down
and went through.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The five faces, blue in-the instrument lights, turned
towards him.  The mouths made black holes and the eyes
glinted white.  Here the roar of the engines was less.
There was a smell of fright-sweat and cigarette smoke.
Bond stood with his legs braced, the guns held unwavering.
He said, 'Goldfinger's dead.  If anyone moves or disobeys
an order I shall kill him.  Pilot, what's your position,
course, height and speed?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The pilot swallowed.  He had to gather saliva before he
could speak.  He said, 'Sir, we are about five hundred
miles east of Goose Bay.  Mr Goldfinger said we would
ditch the plane as near the coast north of there as we
could get.  We were to reassemble at Montreal and Mr
Goldfinger said we would come back and salvage the gold.
Our ground speed is two hundred and fifty miles per hour
and our height two thousand.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'How much flying can you do at that altitude?  You
must be using up fuel pretty fast.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes, sir.  I estimate that we have about two hours left
at this height and speed.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Get me a time signal.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The navigator answered quickly, 'Just had one from
Washington, sir.  Five minutes to five a.m.  Dawn at this
level will be in about an hour.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Where is Weathership Charlie?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'About three hundred miles to the north-east, sir.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Pilot, do you think you can make Goose Bay?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'No, sir, by about a hundred miles.  We can only make
the coast north of there.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Right.  Alter course for Weathership Charlie.  Operator,
call them up and give me the mike.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes, sir.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
While the plane executed a wide curve, Bond listened
to the static and broken snatches of voice that sounded
from the amplifier above his head.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The operator's voice came softly to him, 'Ocean Station
Charlie.  This is Speedbird 510.  G-ALGY calling C for
Charlie, G-ALGY calling Charlie, G-ALGY...'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
A sharp voice broke in.  'G-ALGY give your position.
G-ALGY give your position.  This is Gander Control.
Emergency.  G-ALGY...'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
London came over faintly.  An excited voice began
chattering.  Now voices were coming at them from all
directions.  Bond could imagine the fix being quickly
co-ordinated at all flying control stations, the busy men under
the arcs working on the big plot, telephones being lifted,
urgent voices talking to each other across the world.  The
strong signal of Gander Control smothered all other
transmissions.  'We've located G-ALGY.  We've got them
at about 50 N by 70 E.  All stations stop transmitting.
Priority.  I repeat, we have a fix on G-ALGY...'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Suddenly the quiet voice of C for Charlie came in.
'This is Ocean Station Charlie calling Speedbird 510.
Charlie calling G-ALGY.  Can you hear me?  Come in
Speedbird 510.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond slipped the small gun into his pocket and took the
offered microphone.  He pressed the transmitter switch
and talked quietly into it, watching the crew over the
oblong of plastic.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'C for Charlie this is G-ALGY Speedbird hi-jacked last
evening at Idlewild.  I have killed the man responsible and
partly disabled the plane by depressurizing the cabin.  I
have the crew at gunpoint.  Not enough fuel to make
Goose so propose to ditch as close to you as possible.
Please put out line of flares.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
A new voice, a voice of authority, perhaps the captain's,
came over the air.  'Speedbird this is C for Charlie.  Your
message heard and understood.  Identify the speaker.  I
repeat identify the speaker over.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said and smiled at the sensation his words would
cause, 'Speedbird to C for Charlie.  This is British Secret
Service agent Number 007, I repeat Number 007.
Whitehall Radio will confirm.  I repeat check with
Whitehall Radio over.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There was a stunned pause.  Voices from round the
world tried to break in.  Some control, presumably Gander,
cleared them off the air.  C for Charlie came back, 'Speedbird
this is C for Charlie alias the Angel Gabriel speaking
okay I'll check with Whitehall and Wilco the flares but
London and Gander want more details...'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond broke in, 'Sorry C for Charlie but I can't hold
five men in my sights and make polite conversation just
give me the sea conditions would you and then I'm going
off the air till we come in to ditch over.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Okay Speedbird I see the point wind here force two
sea conditions long smooth swell no broken crests you
should make it okay I'll soon have you on the radar and
we'll keep constant watch on your wavelength have
whisky for one and irons for five waiting good luck over.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said, 'Thanks C for Charlie add a cup of tea to
that order would you I've got a pretty girl on board this is
Speedbird saying over and out.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond released the switch and handed the microphone to
the radio officer.  He said, 'Pilot, they're putting down
flares and keeping constant watch on our wavelength.
Wind force two, long smooth swell with no broken crests.
Now take it easy and let's try and get out of this alive.
As soon as we hit the water I'll get the hatch open.  Until
then if anyone comes through the cockpit door he gets
shot.  Right?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The girl's voice sounded from the door behind Bond.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I was just coming to join the party but I won't now.
Getting shot doesn't agree with me.  But you might call
that man back and make it two whiskies.  Tea makes me
hiccup.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said, 'Pussy, get back to your basket.'  He gave
a last glance round the cockpit and backed out of the door.
</p>

<p class="calibre4"><br class="calibre1"/></p>

<p class="calibre4">
Two hours, two years, later Bond was lying in the warm
cabin in Weathership Charlie listening dreamily to an
early morning radio programme from Canada.  Various
parts of his body ached.  He had got to the tail of the plane
and made the girl kneel down with her head cradled in
her arms on the seat of a chair.  Then he had wedged
himself in behind and over her and had held her life-jacketed
body tightly in his arms and braced his back against the
back of the seat behind him.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
She had been nervously making facetious remarks about
the indelicacy of this position when the belly of the
Stratocruiser had thudded into the first mountain of swell
at a hundred miles an hour.  The huge plane skipped
once and then crashed nose first into a wall of water.  The
impact had broken the back of the plane.  The leaden
weight of the bullion in the baggage compartment had
torn the plane in half, spewing Bond and the girl out into
the icy swell, lit red by the line of flares.  There they had
floated, half stunned, in their yellow life-jackets until the
lifeboat got to them.  By then there were only a few chunks
of wreckage on the surface and the crew, with three tons of
gold round their necks, were on their way down to the bed
of the Atlantic.  The boat hunted for ten minutes but when
no bodies came to the surface they gave up the search and
chugged back up the searchlight beam to the blessed wall
of iron of the old frigate.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
They had been treated like a mixture of royalty and
people from Mars.  Bond had answered the first, most
urgent questions and then it had all suddenly seemed to be
too much for his tired mind to cope with.  Now he was
lying luxuriating in the peace and the heat of the whisky
and wondering about Pussy Galore and why she had
chosen shelter under his wing rather than under Goldfinger's.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The connecting door with the next cabin opened and
the girl came in.  She was wearing nothing but a grey
fisherman's jersey that was decent by half an inch.  The
sleeves were rolled up.  She looked like a painting by
Vertes.  She said, 'People keep on asking if I'd like an
alcohol rub and I keep on saying that if anyone's going
to rub me it's you, and if I'm going to be rubbed with
anything it's you I'd like to be rubbed with.'  She ended
lamely, 'So here I am.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said firmly, 'Lock that door, Pussy, take off that
sweater and come into bed.  You'll catch cold.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
She did as she was told, like an obedient child.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
She lay in the crook of Bond's arm and looked up at
him.  She said, not in a gangster's voice, or a Lesbian's,
but in a girl's voice, 'Will you write to me in Sing Sing?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond looked down into the deep blue-violet eyes
that were no longer hard, imperious.  He bent and kissed
them lightly.  He said, 'They told me you only liked
women.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
She said, 'I never met a man before.'  The toughness
came back into her voice.  'I come from the South.  You
know the definition of a virgin down there?  Well, it's
a girl who can run faster than her brother.  In my case I
couldn't run as fast as my uncle.  I was twelve.  That's
not so good, James.  You ought to be able to guess that.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond smiled down into the pale, beautiful face.  He
said, 'All you need is a course of TLC.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'What's TLC?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Short for Tender Loving Care treatment.  It's what
they write on most papers when a waif gets brought in
to a children's clinic.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I'd like that.'  She looked at the passionate, rather
cruel mouth waiting above hers.  She reached up and
brushed back the comma of black hair that had fallen
over his right eyebrow.  She looked into the fiercely
slitted grey eyes.  'When's it going to start?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond's right hand came slowly up the firm, muscled
thighs, over the flat soft plain of the stomach to the
right breast.  Its point was hard with desire.  He said
softly, 'Now.'  His mouth came ruthlessly down on hers.
