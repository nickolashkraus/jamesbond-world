<h3 class="calibre10"><span class="it1">Swimming the Gauntlet</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> <span class="lead-in">dark water</span> below the police wharf sucked and
kissed at the rusty iron stanchions. In the latticed shadows
cast through the ironwork by the three-quarter moon. Constable
Santos heaved the single aqualung cylinder up on to
Bond’s back and Bond secured the webbing at his waist so that
it would not snarl the strap of Leiter’s second Geiger counter,
the underwater model. He fitted the rubber mouthpiece between
his teeth and adjusted the valve release until the air
supply was just right. He turned off the supply and took out
the mouthpiece. The music of the steel band in the Junkanoo
night-club tripped gaily out over the water. It sounded like a
giant spider dancing on a tenor xylophone.</p>

<p class="pindent">Santos was a huge coloured man, naked except for his swimming
trunks, with pectoral muscles the size of dinner plates.
Bond said, ‘What should I expect to see at this time of night?
Any big fish about?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Santos grinned. ‘Usual harbour stuff, sah. Some barracuda
perhaps. Mebbe a shark. But they’s lazy an overfed with the
refuse and muck from de drains. Dey won’t trouble you—less
you bleedin’ that is. They’ll be night-crawlin’ things on the
bottom—lobster, crab, mebbe a small pus-feller or two. The
bottom’s mostly seagrass on bits o’ iron from wrecks an plenty
of bottle and suchlike. Mucky, if you get me, sah. But the
water’s clear and you’ll be hokay with this moon and the lights
from the <span class="it">Disco</span> to guide you. Tek you bout twelve, fifteen minute,
I’da say. Funny ting. I been lookin’ for an hour and dere’s
no watchman on deck and no one in the wheelhouse. An the bit
o’ breeze should hide you bubbles. Coulda give you an oxygen
re-breather, but ah doan like dem tings. Them dangerous.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right, let’s go then. See you in about half an hour.’ Bond
felt for the knife at his waist, shifted the webbing and put the
mouthpiece between his teeth. He turned on the air and, his fins
slapping on the muddy sand, walked down and into the water.
There he bent down, spat into his mask to prevent it steaming
up, washed it and adjusted it. Then he walked slowly on, getting
used to the breathing. By the end of the wharf he was up
to his ears. He quietly submerged and launched himself
forward into an easy leg crawl, his hands along his flanks.</p>

<p class="pindent">The mud shelved steeply and Bond kept on going down,
until, at about forty feet, he was only a few inches above the
bottom. He glanced at the big luminous figures on the dial of
his watch—12.10. He untensed himself and put his legs into
an easy, relaxed rhythm.</p>

<p class="pindent">Through the roof of small waves the pale moonlight flickered
on the grey bottom, and the refuse—motor tyres, cans, bottles—cast
black shadows. A small octopus, feeling his shock-wave,
turned from dark brown to pale grey and squeezed itself softly
back into the mouth of the oil-drum that was its home. Sea
flowers, the gelatinous polyps that grow out of the sand at
night, whisked down their holes as Bond’s black shadow
touched them. Other tiny night things puffed thin jets of silt
out of their small volcanoes in the mud as they felt the tremor of
Bond’s passage, and an occasional hermit crab snapped itself
back into its borrowed shell. It was like travelling across a moon
landscape, on and under which many mysterious creatures
lived minute lives. Bond watched it all, carefully, as if he
had been an underwater naturalist. He knew that was the way
to keep nerves steady under the sea—to focus the whole attention
on the people who lived there and not try and probe
the sinister grey walls of mist for imaginary monsters.</p>

<p class="pindent">The rhythm of his steady progress soon became automatic,
and while Bond, keeping the moon at his right shoulder, held
to his course, his mind reached back to Domino. So she was the
sister of the man who probably hi-jacked the plane! Probably
even Largo, if Largo was in fact involved in the plot, didn’t
know this. So what did the relationship amount to? Coincidence.
It could be nothing else. Her whole manner was so
entirely innocent. And yet it was one more thin straw to add to
the meagre pile that seemed in some indeterminate way to be
adding up to Largo’s involvement. And Largo’s reaction at the
word ‘spectre’. That could be put down to Italian superstition—or
it could not. Bond had a deadly feeling that all these tiny
scraps amounted to the tip of an iceberg—a few feet of ice
pinnacle, with below, a thousand tons of the stuff. Should he
report? Or shouldn’t he? Bond’s mind boiled with indecision.
How to put it? How to grade the intelligence so that it
would reflect his doubts? How much to say and how much to
leave out?</p>

<p class="pindent">The extrasensory antennae of the human body, the senses
left over from the jungle life of millions of years ago, sharpen
unconsciously when man knows that he is on the edge of
danger. Bond’s mind was concentrating on something far away
from his present risks, but beneath his conscious thoughts his
senses were questing for enemies. Now suddenly the alarm
was sounded by a hidden nerve—Danger! Danger! Danger!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s body tensed. His hand went to his knife and his head
swivelled sharply to the right—not to the left or behind him.
His senses told him to look to the right.</p>

<p class="pindent">A big barracuda, if it is twenty pounds or over, is the most
fearsome fish in the seas. Clean and straight and malevolent, it
is all hostile weapon from the long snarling mouth in the cruel
jaw that can open like a rattlesnake’s to an angle of ninety
degrees, along the blue and silver steel of the body to the lazy
power of the tail-fin that helps to make this fish one of the five
fastest sprinters in the seas. This one, moving parallel with Bond,
ten yards away just inside the wall of grey mist that was the
edge of visibility, was showing its danger signals. The broad
lateral stripes showed vividly—the angry hunting sign—the
gold and black tiger’s eye was on him, watchful, incurious, and
the long mouth was open half an inch so that the moonlight
glittered on the sharpest row of teeth in the ocean—teeth that
don’t bite at the flesh, teeth that tear out a chunk and swallow
and then hit and scythe again.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s stomach crawled with the ants of fear and his skin
tightened at his groin. Cautiously he glanced at his watch.
About three more minutes to go before he was due to come up
with the <span class="it">Disco</span>. He made a sudden turn and attacked fast towards
the great fish, flashing his knife in fast offensive lunges.
The giant barracuda gave a couple of lazy wags of its tail and,
when Bond turned back on his course, it also turned and
resumed its indolent, sneering cruise, weighing him up, choosing
which bit—the shoulder, the buttock, the foot—to take
first.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond tried to recall what he knew about big predator fish,
what he had experienced with them before. The first rule was
not to panic, to be unafraid. Fear communicates itself to fish as
it does to dogs and horses. Establish a quiet pattern of behaviour
and stick to it. Don’t show confusion or act chaotically. In
the sea, untidiness, ragged behaviour, mean that the possible
victim is out of control, vulnerable. So keep to a rhythm. A
thrashing fish is everyone’s prey. A crab or a shell thrown
upside down by a wave is offering its underside to a hundred
enemies. A fish on its side is a dead fish. Bond trudged
rhythmically on, exuding immunity.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now the pale moonscape changed. A meadow of soft seagrass
showed up ahead. In the deep, slow currents it waved
languidly, like deep fur. The hypnotic motion made Bond feel
slightly seasick. Dotted sparsely in the grass were the big black
footballs of dead sponges growing out of the sand like giant
puffballs—Nassau’s only export until a fungus had got at them
and had killed the sponge crop as surely as myxomatosis has
killed rabbits. Bond’s black shadow flickered across the breathing
lawn like a clumsy bat. To the right of his shadow, the thin
black lance cast by the barracuda moved with quiet precision.</p>

<p class="pindent">A dense mass of silvery small fry showed up ahead, suspended
in mid stream as if they had been bottled in aspic.
When the two parallel bodies approached, the mass divided
sharply, leaving wide channels for the two enemies, and then
closing behind them into the phalanx they adopted for an
illusory protection. Through the cloud of fish, Bond watched
the barracuda. It moved majestically on, ignoring the food
around it as a fox creeping up on the chicken run will ignore
the rabbits in the warren. Bond sealed himself in the armour of
his rhythm, transmitting to the barracuda that he was a bigger,
a more dangerous fish, that the barracuda must not be misled
by the whiteness of the flesh.</p>

<p class="pindent">Amongst the waving grass, the black barb of the anchor
looked like another enemy. The trailing chain rose from the
bottom and disappeared into the upper mists. Bond followed it
up, forgetting the barracuda in his relief at hitting the target and
in the excitement of what he might find.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now he swam very slowly, watching the white explosion of
the moon on the surface contract and define itself. Once he
looked down. There was no sign of the barracuda. Perhaps the
anchor and chain had seemed inimical. The long hull of the
ship grew out of the upper mists and took shape, a great
Zeppelin in the water. The folded mechanism of the hydrofoil
looked ungainly, as if it did not belong. Bond clung for a moment
to its starboard flange to get his bearings. Far down to his
left, the big twin screws, bright in the moonlight, hung suspended,
motionless but somehow charged with thrashing speed.
Bond moved slowly along the hull towards them, staring upwards
for what he sought. He drew in his breath. Yes, it was
there, the ridge of a wide hatch below the waterline. Bond
groped over it, measuring. About twelve feet square, divided
down the centre. Bond paused for a moment, wondering what
was inside the closed doors. He pressed the switch of the
Geiger counter and held the machine against the steel plates.
He watched the dial of the meter on his left wrist. It trembled to
show the machine was alive, but it registered only the fraction
Leiter had told him to expect from the hull. Bond switched the
thing off. So much for that. Now for home.</p>

<p class="pindent">The clang beside his ear and the sharp impact against his left
shoulder were simultaneous. Automatically, Bond sprang back
from the hull. Below him the bright needle of the spear wavered
slowly down into the depths. Bond whirled. The man, his black
rubber suit glinting like armour in the moonlight, was pedalling
furiously in the water while he thrust another spear down the
barrel of the CO2 gun. Bond hurled himself towards him,
flailing at the water with his fins. The man pulled back the
loading lever and levelled the gun. Bond knew he couldn’t make
it. He was six strokes away. He stopped suddenly, ducked his
head, and jack-knifed down. He felt the small shock-wave of
the silent explosion of gas and something hit his foot. Now! He
soared up below the man and scythed upwards with his knife.
The blade went in. He felt the black rubber against his hand.
Then the butt of the gun hit him behind the ear and a white
hand came down and scrabbled at his air-pipe. Bond slashed
wildly with the knife, his hand moving with terrifying slowness
through the water. The point ripped something. The hand let
go of the mask, but now Bond couldn’t see. Again the butt of
the gun crashed down on his head. Now the water was full of
black smoke, heavy, stringy stuff that clung to the glass of his
mask. Bond backed painfully, slowly away, clawing at the
glass. At last it cleared. The black smoke was coming out of
the man, out of his stomach. But the gun was coming up again
slowly, agonizingly, as if it weighed a ton, and the bright sting
of the spear showed at its mouth. Now the webbed feet were
hardly stirring, but the man was sinking slowly down to Bond’s
level. Suspended straight in the water, he looked like one of
those little celluloid figures in a Ptolemy jar that rise and fall
gracefully with pressure on the rubber top to the jar. Bond
couldn’t get his limbs to obey. They felt like lead. He shook
his head to clear it, but still his hands and flippers moved only
half consciously, all speed gone. Now he could see the bared
teeth round the other man’s rubber mouthpiece. The gun was
at his head, at his throat, at his heart. Bond’s hands crept up
his chest to protect him while his flippers moved sluggishly,
like broken wings, below him.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then, suddenly, the man was hurled towards Bond as if
he had been kicked in the back. His arms spread in a curious
gesture of embrace for Bond and the gun tumbled slowly
away between them and disappeared. A puff of black blood
spread out into the sea from behind the man’s back and
his hands wavered out and up in vague surrender while his
head twisted on his shoulders to see what had done this to
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">And now, a few yards behind the man, shreds of black rubber
hanging from its jaws, Bond saw the barracuda. It was lying
broadside on, seven or eight feet of silver and blue torpedo, and
round its jaws there was a thin mist of blood, the taste in the
water that had triggered its attack.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now the great tiger’s eye looked coldly at Bond and then
downwards at the slowly sinking man. It gave a horrible yawning
gulp to rid itself of the shreds of rubber, turned lazily three-quarters
on, quivered in all its length and dived like a bolt of
white light. It hit the man on the right shoulder with wide open
jaws, shook him once, furiously, like a dog with a rat, and then
backed away. Bond felt the vomit rising in his gorge like molten
lava. He swallowed it down and slowly, as if in a dream, began
swimming with languid, sleepy strokes away from the scene.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had not gone many yards when something hit the
surface to his left and the moonlight glinted on a silvery kind of
egg that turned lazily over and over as it went down. It meant
nothing to Bond, but, two strokes later, he received a violent
blow in the stomach that knocked him sideways. It also
knocked sense into him and he began to move fast through the
water, at the same time planing downwards towards the bottom.
More buffets hit him in quick succession, but the grenades
were bracketing the blood patch near the ship’s hull and the
shock-waves of the explosion became less.</p>

<p class="pindent">The bottom showed up—the friendly waving fur, the great
black toadstools of the dead sponges and the darting shoals of
small fish fleeing with Bond from the explosions. Now Bond
swam with all his strength. At any moment a boat would be got
over the side and another diver would go down. With any luck
he would find no traces of Bond’s visit and conclude that the
underwater sentry had been killed by shark or barracuda. It
would be interesting to see what Largo would report to the harbour
police. Difficult to explain the necessity for an armed
underwater sentry for a pleasure yacht in a peaceful harbour!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond trudged on across the shifting seagrass. His head ached
furiously. Gingerly he put up a hand and felt the two great
bruises. The skin felt intact. But for the cushion of water, the two
blows with the butt of the gun would have knocked him out.
As it was, he still felt half stunned and when he came to the end
of the seagrass and to the soft white moon landscape with its
occasional little volcano puffs from the sea-worms he felt as if he
was on the edge of delirium. Wild commotion at the edge of his
field of vision shocked him out of the semi-trance. A giant fish,
the barracuda, was passing him. It seemed to have gone mad.
It was snaking along, biting at its tail, its long body curling
and snapping back in a jack-knife motion, its mouth opening
wide and shutting again in spasms. Bond watched it hurtle away
into the grey mist. He felt somehow sorry to see the wonderful
king of the sea reduced to this hideous jiggling automaton.
There was something obscene about it, like the blind weaving
of a punchy boxer before he finally crashes to the canvas. One
of the explosions must have crushed a nerve centre, wrecked
some delicate balance mechanism in the fish’s brain. It wouldn’t
last long. A greater predator than itself, a shark, would note the
signs, the loss of symmetry that is suicide in the seas. He would
follow for a while until the spasms slackened. Then the shark
would make a short jabbing run. The barracuda would react
sluggishly and that would be the end—in three great grunting
bites, the head first and then the still jerking body. And the
shark would cruise quietly on, its sickle mouth trailing morsels
for the black and yellow pilot fish below his jaws and perhaps
for the remora or two, the parasites that travel with the great
host, that pick the shark’s teeth when it is sleeping and the
jaws are relaxed.</p>

<p class="pindent">And now there were the grey-slimed motor tyres, the bottles,
the cans and the scaffolding of the wharf. Bond slid over the
shelving sand and knelt in the shallows, his head down, not
capable of carrying the heavy aqualung up the beach, an
exhausted animal ready to drop.</p>
