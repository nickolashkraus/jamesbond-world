<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">A</span>t</span> <span class="lead-in">the end</span> of the hour’s treatment Bond felt as if his
body had been eviscerated and then run through a
wringer. He put on his clothes and, cursing M, climbed weakly
back up the stairs into what, by comparison with the world of
nakedness and indignities in the basement, were civilized surroundings.
At the entrance to the main lounge were two
telephone booths. The switchboard put him through to the
only Headquarters number he was allowed to call on an outside
line. He knew that all such outside calls were monitored. As
he asked for Records, he recognized the hollowness on the
line that meant the line was bugged. He gave his number
to Head of Records and put his question, adding that the
subject was an Oriental probably of Portuguese extraction.
After ten minutes Head of Records came back to
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s a Tong sign.’ His voice sounded interested. ‘The Red
Lightning Tong. Unusual to find anyone but a full-blooded
Chinaman being a member. It’s not the usual semi-religious
organization. This is entirely criminal. Station H had dealings
with it once. They’re represented in Hong Kong, but their
headquarters are across the bay in Macao. Station H paid big
money to get a courier service running into Pekin. Worked like
a dream, so they gave the line a trial with some heavy stuff. It
bounced, badly. Lost a couple of H’s top men. It was a double-cross.
Turned out that Redland had some sort of a deal with
these people. Hell of a mess. Since then they’ve cropped up
from time to time in drugs, gold smuggling to India, and top-bracket
White Slavery. They’re big people. We’d be interested
if you’ve got any kind of a line.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, ‘Thanks, Records. No, I’ve got nothing definite.
First time I’ve heard of these Red Lightning people. Let you
know if anything develops. So long.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond thoughtfully put back the receiver. How interesting!
Now what the hell could this man be doing at Shrublands?
Bond walked out of the booth. A movement in the next booth
caught his eye. Count Lippe, his back to Bond, had just picked
up the receiver. How long had he been in there? Had he heard
Bond’s inquiry? Or his comment? Bond had the crawling
sensation at the pit of his stomach he knew so well—the signal
that he had probably made a dangerous and silly mistake. He
glanced at his watch. It was seven thirty. He walked through the
lounge to the sun-parlour where ‘dinner’ was being served. He
gave his name to the elderly woman with a wardress face
behind a long counter. She consulted a list and ladled hot
vegetable soup into a plastic mug. Bond took the mug. He
said anxiously, ‘Is that all?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The woman didn’t smile. She said severely, ‘You’re lucky.
You wouldn’t be getting as much on Starvation. And you may
have soup every day at midday and two cups of tea at four
o’clock.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gave her a bitter smile. He took the horrible mug over
to one of the little café tables near the windows overlooking the
dark lawn and sat down and sipped the thin soup while he
watched some of his fellow inmates meandering aimlessly,
weakly, through the room. Now he felt a grain of sympathy for
the wretches. Now he was a member of their club. Now he had
been initiated. He drank the soup down to the last neat cube of
carrot and walked abstractedly off to his room, thinking of
Count Lippe, thinking of sleep, but above all thinking of his
empty stomach.</p>

<p class="pindent">After two days of this, Bond felt terrible. He had a permanent
slight nagging headache, the whites of his eyes had turned
rather yellow, and his tongue was deeply furred. His masseur
told him not to worry. This was as it should be. These were the
poisons leaving his body. Bond, now a permanent prey to
lassitude, didn’t argue. Nothing seemed to matter any more
but the single orange and hot water for breakfast, the mugs of
hot soup, and the cups of tea which Bond filled with spoonfuls
of brown sugar, the only variety that had Mr Wain’s sanction.</p>

<p class="pindent">On the third day, after the massage and the shock of the Sitz
baths, Bond had on his programme ‘Osteopathic Manipulation
and Traction’. He was directed to a new section of the basement,
withdrawn and silent. When he opened the designated
door he expected to find some hairy H-man waiting for him
with flexed muscles. (H-man, he had discovered, stood for
Health-man. It was the smart thing to call oneself if you were a
naturopath.) He stopped in his tracks. The girl, Patricia something,
whom he had not set eyes on since his first day, stood
waiting for him beside the couch. He closed the door behind
him and said, ‘Good lord. Is this what you do?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She was used to this reaction of the men patients and rather
touchy about it. She didn’t smile. She said in a businesslike
voice, ‘Nearly twenty per cent of osteopaths are women. Take
off your clothes, please. Everything except your pants.’ When
Bond had amusedly obeyed she told him to stand in front of
her. She walked round him, examining him with eyes in which
there was nothing but professional interest. Without commenting
on his scars she told him to lie face downwards on the
couch and, with strong, precise, and thoroughly practised
holds, went through the handling and joint-cracking of her
profession.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond soon realized that she was an extremely powerful girl.
His muscled body, admittedly unresistant, seemed to be easy
going for her. Bond felt a kind of resentment at the neutrality of
this relationship between an attractive girl and a half naked
man. At the end of the treatment she told him to stand up and
clasp his hands behind her neck. Her eyes, a few inches away
from his, held nothing but professional concentration. She
hauled strongly away from him, presumably with the object of
freeing his vertebrae. This was too much for Bond. At the end
of it, when she told him to release his hands, he did nothing of
the sort. He tightened them, pulled her head sharply towards
him, and kissed her full on the lips. She ducked quickly down
through his arms and straightened herself, her cheeks red and
her eyes shining with anger. Bond smiled at her, knowing that
he had never missed a slap in the face, and a hard one at that,
by so little. He said. ‘It’s all very well, but I just had to do it.
You shouldn’t have a mouth like that if you’re going to be an
osteopath.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The anger in her eyes subsided a fraction. She said, ‘The last
time that happened, the man had to leave by the next train.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. He made a threatening move towards her. ‘If
I thought there was any hope of being kicked out of this damn
place I’d kiss you again.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She said, ‘Don’t be silly. Now pick up your things. You’ve
got half an hour’s Traction.’ She smiled grimly. ‘That ought
to keep you quiet.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said morosely, ‘Oh, all right. But only on condition you
let me take you out on your next day off.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We’ll see about that. It depends how you behave at the next
treatment.’ She held open the door. Bond picked up his clothes
and went out, almost colliding with a man coming down the
passage. It was Count Lippe, in slacks and a gay windcheater.
He ignored Bond. With a smile and a slight bow he said to the
girl, ‘Here comes the lamb to the slaughter. I hope you’re not
feeling too strong today.’ His eyes twinkled charmingly.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl said briskly, ‘Just get ready, please. I shan’t be a
moment putting Mr Bond on the Traction table.’ She moved
off down the passage with Bond following.</p>

<p class="pindent">She opened the door of a small anteroom, told Bond to put
his things down on a chair, and pulled aside plastic curtains that
formed a partition. Just inside the curtains was an odd-looking
kind of surgical couch in leather and gleaming aluminium.
Bond didn’t like the look of it at all. While the girl fiddled with
a series of straps attached to three upholstered sections that
appeared to be on runners, Bond examined the contraption
suspiciously. Below the couch was a stout electric motor on
which a plate announced that this was the Hercules Motorized
Traction Table. A power drive in the shape of articulated rods
stretched upwards from the motor to each of the three cushioned
sections of the couch and terminated in tension screws
to which the three sets of straps were attached. In front of the
raised portion where the patient’s head would lie, and approximately
level with his face, was a large dial marked in
lb.-pressure up to 200. After 150 lb. the numerals were in red.
Below the headrest were grips for the patient’s hands. Bond
noted gloomily that the leather on the grips was stained with,
presumably, sweat.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Lie face downwards here, please.’ The girl held the straps
ready.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said obstinately, ‘Not until you tell me what this thing
does. I don’t like the look of it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl said impatiently, ‘This is simply a machine for
stretching your spine. You’ve got some mild spinal lesions. It
will help to free those. And at the base of your spine you’ve got
some right sacroiliac strain. It’ll help that too. You won’t find
it bad at all. Just a stretching sensation. It’s very soothing really.
Quite a lot of patients fall asleep.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘This one won’t,’ said Bond firmly. ‘What strength are you
going to give me? Why are those top figures in red? Are you
sure I’m not going to be pulled apart?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl said with a touch of impatience, ‘Don’t be silly. Of
course if there was too much tension it might be dangerous.
But I shall be starting you at only 90 lb. and in a quarter of an
hour I shall come and see how you’re getting on and probably
put you up to 120. Now come along. I’ve got another patient
waiting.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Reluctantly Bond climbed up on the couch and lay on his
face with his nose and mouth buried in a deep cleft in the
headrest. He said, his voice muffled by the leather, ‘If you kill
me, I’ll sue.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He felt the straps being tightened round his chest and then
round his hips. The girl’s skirt brushed the side of his face as
she bent to reach the control lever beside the big dial. The
motor began to whine. The straps tightened and then relaxed,
tightened and relaxed. Bond felt as if his body was being
stretched by giant hands. It was a curious sensation, but not
unpleasant. With difficulty Bond raised his head. The needle
on the dial stood at ninety. Now the machine was making a
soft iron hee-hawing, like a mechanical donkey, as the gears
alternatively engaged and disengaged to produce the rhythmic
traction.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Are you all right?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes.’ He heard the girl pass through the plastic curtains and
then the click of the outer door. Bond abandoned himself to the
soft feel of the leather at his face, to the relentless intermittent
haul on his spine and to the hypnotic whine and drone of the
machine. It really wasn’t too bad. How silly to have had nerves
about it!</p>

<p class="pindent">A quarter of an hour later he heard again the click of the
outside door and the swish of the curtains.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Fine.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl’s hand came into his line of vision as she turned the
lever. Bond raised his head. The needle crept up to 120. Now
the pull was really hard and the voice of the machine was much
louder.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl put her head down to his. She laid a reassuring hand
on his shoulder. She said, her voice loud above the noise of the
gears, ‘Only another quarter of an hour to go.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right.’ Bond’s voice was careful. He was probing the new
strength of the giant haul on his body. The curtains swished.
Now the click of the outside door was drowned by the noise of
the machine. Slowly Bond relaxed again into the arms of the
rhythm.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was perhaps five minutes later when a tiny movement of
the air against his face made Bond open his eyes. In front of his
eyes was a hand, a man’s hand, reaching softly for the lever of
the accelerator. Bond watched it, at first fascinated, and then
with dawning horror as the lever was slowly depressed and the
straps began to haul madly at his body. He shouted—something,
he didn’t know what. His whole body was racked with a
great pain. Desperately he lifted his head and shouted again.
On the dial, the needle was trembling at 200! His head dropped
back, exhausted. Through a mist of sweat he watched the hand
softly release the lever. The hand paused and turned slowly so
that the back of the wrist was just below his eyes. In the centre
of the wrist was the little red sign of the zigzag and the two
bisecting lines. A voice said quietly, close up against his ear,
‘You will not meddle again, my friend.’ Then there was nothing
but the great whine and groan of the machine and the bite of
the straps that were tearing his body in half. Bond began to
scream, weakly, while the sweat poured from him and dripped
off the leather cushions on to the floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then suddenly there was blackness.</p>
