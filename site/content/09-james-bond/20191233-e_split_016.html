<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">S</span>o</span> <span class="lead-in">far as</span> <span class="g">SPECTRE</span> was concerned, Plan Omega had gone
exactly as Blofeld had known it would and Phases I to
III in their entirety had been completed on schedule and
without a hitch.</p>

<p class="pindent">Giuseppe Petacchi, the late Giuseppe Petacchi, had been
well chosen. At the age of eighteen he had been co-pilot of a
Focke-Wulf 200 from the Adriatic anti-submarine patrol, one
of the few hand-picked Italian airmen who had been allowed to
handle these German planes. The group was issued with the
latest German pressure mines charged with the new Hexogen
explosive just when the tide had turned in the Allied battle
up the spine of Italy. Petacchi had known where his destiny
lay and had gone into business for himself. On a routine patrol,
he had shot the pilot and the navigator, very carefully, with one
.38 bullet in the back of the head for each of them, and had
brought the big plane skimming in, just above the waves to
avoid the anti-aircraft fire, to the harbour of Bari. Then he had
hung his shirt out of the cockpit as a token of surrender and
had waited for the <span class="s">RAF</span> launch. He had been decorated by the
English and the Americans for this exploit and had been
awarded £10,000 from special funds for his presentation to
the Allies of the pressure mine. He had told a highly coloured
story to the Intelligence people of having been a one-man
resistance ever since he had been old enough to join the
Italian Air Force, and he emerged at the end of the war as one
of Italy’s most gallant resistance heroes. From then on life had
been easy—pilot and later captain in Alitalia when it got going
again, and then back into the new Italian Air Force as colonel.
His secondment to <span class="g">NATO</span> followed and then his appointment as
one of the six Italians chosen for the Advance Striking Force.
But he was now thirty-four, and it occurred to him that he had
had just about enough of flying. He especially did not care for
the idea of being part of the spearhead of <span class="g">NATO</span> defences. It
was time for younger men to provide the heroics. And all his
life he had had a passion for owning things—flashy, exciting,
expensive things. He had most of what he desired—a couple of
gold cigarette cases, a solid gold Rolex Oyster Perpetual
Chronometer on a flexible gold bracelet, a white convertible
Lancia Gran Turismo, plenty of sharp clothes, and all the girls
he wanted (he had once been briefly married but it had not
been a success). Now he desired, and what he desired he often
got, a particular Ghia-bodied 3,500 <span class="s">GT</span> Maserati he had seen
at the Milan motor show. He also wanted Out—out of the pale
green corridors of <span class="g">NATO</span>, out of the air force and, therefore, off
to new worlds with a new name. Rio de Janeiro sounded just
right. But all this meant a new passport, plenty of money, and
‘organismo’—the vital ‘organismo’.</p>

<p class="pindent">The organismo turned up, and turned up bearing just those
gifts that Petacchi lusted for. It came in the shape of an Italian
named Fonda who was at that time No 4 in <span class="g">SPECTRE</span> and who
had been casing the personnel of <span class="g">NATO</span>, via Versailles and Paris
night-clubs and restaurants, for just such a man. It had taken
one whole very careful month to prepare the bait and inch it
forward towards the fish and, when it was finally presented,
No 4 had been almost put off by the greed with which it had
been gobbled. There was delay while the possibility of a double-cross
was probed by <span class="g">SPECTRE</span>, but finally all the lights were
green and the full proposition was laid out for inspection.
Petacchi was to get on the Vindicator training course and
hi-jack the plane. (There was no mention of atomic weapons.
This was a Cuban revolutionary group who wanted to call
attention to its existence and aims by a dramatic piece of self-advertisement.
Petacchi closed his ears to this specious tale.
He didn’t mind in the least who wanted the plane so long as
he was paid.) In exchange, Petacchi would receive one million
dollars, a new passport in any name and nationality he chose,
and immediate onward passage from the point of delivery to
Rio de Janeiro. Many details were discussed and perfected,
and when, at eight o’clock in the evening of that June 2nd, the
Vindicator screamed off down the runway and out over St
Alban’s Head, Petacchi was tense but confident.</p>

<p class="pindent">For the training flights, a couple of ordinary civil aircraft
seats had been fixed inside the roomy fuselage just back of the
large cockpit, and Petacchi sat quietly for a whole hour and
watched the five men at work at the crowded dials and instruments.
When it came to his turn to fly the plane he was quite
satisfied that he could dispense with all five of them. Once he
had set George, there would be nothing to do but stay awake
and make certain from time to time that he was keeping
exactly at 32,000 feet, just above the transatlantic air channel.
There would be a tricky moment when he turned off the East-West
channel on to the North-South for the Bahamas, but
this had all been worked out for him and every move he would
have to make was written down in the notebook in his breast
pocket. The landing was going to need very steady nerves, but
for one million dollars the steady nerves would be summoned.</p>

<p class="pindent">For the tenth time Petacchi consulted the Rolex. Now! He
verified and tested the oxygen mask in the bulkhead beside him
and laid it down ready. Next he took the little red-ringed cylinder
out of his pocket and remembered exactly how many turns
to give the release valve. Then he put it back in his pocket and
went through into the cockpit.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hullo, Seppy. Enjoying the flight?’ The pilot liked the
Italian. They had gone out together on one or two majestic
thrashes in Bournemouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sure, sure.’ Petacchi asked some questions, verified the
course set on George, checked the air-speed and altitude. Now
everyone in the cockpit was relaxed, almost drowsy. Five more
hours to go. Rather a bind missing <span class="it">North by North-West</span> at the
Odeon. But one would catch up with it at Southampton.
Petacchi stood with his back to the metal map rack that held
the log and the charts. His right hand went to his pocket, felt
for the release valve, and gave it three complete turns. He
eased the cylinder out of his pocket and slipped it behind him
and down behind the books.</p>

<p class="pindent">Petacchi stretched and yawned. ‘Is time for a zizz,’ he said
amiably. He had got the slang phrase pat. It rolled easily off the
tongue.</p>

<p class="pindent">The navigator laughed. ‘What do they call it in Italian—“Zizzo”?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Petacchi grinned cheerfully. He went through the open
hatch, got back to his chair, clamped on his oxygen mask, and
turned the control regulator to 100 per cent oxygen to cut out
the air bleed. Then he made himself comfortable and watched.</p>

<p class="pindent">They had said it would take under five minutes. Sure
enough, in about two minutes, the man nearest to the map
rack, the navigator, suddenly clutched his throat and fell forward,
gargling horribly. The radio operator dropped his
earphones and started forward, but with his second step he
was down on his knees. He lurched sideways and collapsed.
Now the three other men began to fight for air, briefly, terribly.
The co-pilot and the flight engineer writhed off their stools
together. They clawed vaguely at each other and then fell back,
spreadeagled. The pilot groped up towards the microphone
above his head, said something indistinctly, got half to his feet,
turned slowly so that his bulging eyes, already dead, seemed
to stare through the hatchway into Petacchi’s, and then
thudded down on top of the body of his co-pilot.</p>

<p class="pindent">Petacchi glanced at his watch. Four minutes flat. Give them
one more minute. When the minute was up, he took rubber
gloves out of his pocket, put them on and pressing the oxygen
mask tight against his face and trailing the flexible tube behind
him, he went forward, reached down into the map rack, and
closed the valve on the cylinder of cyanide. He verified George
and adjusted the cabin pressurization to help clear the poison
gas. He then went back to his seat to wait for fifteen minutes.</p>

<p class="pindent">They had said fifteen would be enough, but at the last
moment he gave it another ten and then, still with his oxygen
mask on, he went forward again and began slowly, for the
oxygen made him rather breathless, to pull the bodies back
into the fuselage. When the cockpit was clear, he took a small
phial of crystals out of his trousers pocket, took out the cork,
and sprinkled the cabin floor with them. He went down on his
knees and watched the crystals. They kept their white colour.
He eased his oxygen mask away and took a small cautious
sniff. There was no smell. But still, when he took over the
controls and began easing the plane down to 32,000 and then
slightly north-west-by-west to get into the traffic lane, he kept
the mask on.</p>

<p class="pindent">The giant plane whispered on into the night. The cockpit,
bright with the yellow eyes of the dials, was quiet and warm. In
the deafening silence in the cockpit of a big jet in flight there
was only the faint buzz of an invector. As he verified the dials,
the click of each switch seemed as loud as a small-calibre
pistol-shot.</p>

<p class="pindent">Petacchi again checked George with the gyro and verified
each fuel tank to see that they were all feeding evenly. One
tank pump needed adjustment. The jet pipe temperatures were
not over-heating.</p>

<p class="pindent">Satisfied, Petacchi settled himself comfortably in the pilot’s
seat and swallowed a benzedrine tablet and thought about the
future. One of the headphones scattered on the floor of the
cockpit began to chirrup loudly. Petacchi glanced at his watch.
Of course! Boscombe Air Traffic Control was trying to raise the
Vindicator. He had missed the third of the half-hourly calls.
How long would Air Control wait before alerting Air Sea
Rescue, Bomber Command, and the Air Ministry? There
would first be checks and double-checks with the Southern
Rescue Centre. They would probably take another half-hour
and by that time he would be well out over the Atlantic.</p>

<p class="pindent">The chirrup of the headphones went quiet. Petacchi got up
from his seat and took a look at the radar screen. He watched it
for some time, noting the occasional ‘blip’ of planes being overhauled
below him. Would his own swift passage above the air
corridor be noted by the planes as he passed above them? Unlikely.
The radar on commercial planes has a limited field of
vision in a forward cone. He would almost certainly not be
spotted until he crossed the Defence Early Warning line, and
<span class="g">DEW</span> would probably put him down as a commercial jet that
had strayed above its normal channel.</p>

<p class="pindent">Petacchi went back to the pilot’s seat and again minutely
checked the dials. He weaved the plane gently to get the feel of
the controls. Behind him, the bodies on the floor of the fuselage
stirred uneasily. The plane answered perfectly. It was like
driving a beautiful quiet motor-car. Petacchi dreamed briefly of
the Maserati. What colour? Better not his usual white, or anything
spectacular. Dark blue with a thin red line along the
coachwork. Something quiet and respectable that would fit in
with his new, quiet identity. It would be fun to run her in
some of the trials and road races—even the Mexican ‘2,000’.
But that would be too dangerous. Supposing he won and his
picture got into the papers! No. He would have to cut out
anything like that. He would only drive the car really fast
when he wanted to get a girl. They melted in a fast car. Why
was that? The sense of surrender to the machine, to the man
whose strong, sunburned hands were on the wheel? But it was
always so. You turned the car into a wood after ten minutes
at 150 and you would almost have to lift the girl out and lay
her down on the moss, her limbs would be so trembling and
soft.</p>

<p class="pindent">Petacchi pulled himself out of the daydream. He glanced at
his watch. The Vindicator was already four hours out. At 600
mph one certainly covered the miles. The coastline of America
should be on the screen by now. He got up and had a look. Yes,
there, 500 miles away, was the coastline map already in high
definition, the bulge that was Boston, and the silvery creek of
the Hudson River. No need to check his position with weather
ships Delta or Echo that would be somewhere below him. He
was dead on course and it would soon be time to turn off the
East-West channel.</p>

<p class="pindent">Petacchi went back to his seat, munched another benzedrine
tablet, and consulted his chart. He got his hands to the controls
and watched the eerie glow of the gyro compass. Now! He
eased the controls gently round in a fairly tight curve, then he
flattened out again, edged the plane exactly on to its new course,
and re-set George. Now he was flying due south, now he was
on the last lap, a bare three hours to go. It was time to start
worrying about the landing.</p>

<p class="pindent">Petacchi took out his little notebook. ‘Watch for the lights of
Grand Bahama to port, and Palm Beach to starboard. Be ready
to pick up the navigational aids from No 1’s yacht—dot-dot-dash;
dot-dot-dash, jettison fuel, lose height to around 1,000
feet for the last quarter of an hour, kill speed with the air brakes,
and lose more height. Watch out for the flashing red beacon
and prepare for the final approach. Flaps down only at the
check altitude with about 140 knots indicated. Depth of water
will be forty feet. You will have plenty of time to get out of the
escape hatch. You will be taken on board No 1’s yacht. There
is a Bahamas Airways flight to Miami at 8.30 on the next
morning and then Braniff or Real Airlines for the rest of the
way. No 1 will give you the money in 1,000-dollar bills or in
Travellers Cheques. He will have both available, also the passport
in the name of Enrico Valli, Company Director.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Petacchi checked his position, course, and speed. Only one
more hour to go. It was three am <span class="s">GMT</span>, nine pm Nassau
time. A full moon was coming up and the carpet of clouds
10,000 feet below was a snowfield. Petacchi dowsed the collision
lights on his wing tips and fuselage. He checked the fuel:
2,000 gallons including the reserve tanks. He would need 500
for the last four hundred miles. He pulled the release valve on
the reserve tanks and lost 1,000 gallons. With the loss of weight
the plane began to climb slowly and he corrected back to 32,000.
Now there was twenty minutes to go—time to begin the long
descent. . .</p>

<p class="line10">★</p>

<p class="pindent">Down through the cloud base, the moments of blindness and
then, far below, the sparse lights of North and South Bimini
winked palely against the silver sheen of the moon on the quiet
sea. There were no whitecaps. The met. report he had picked
up from Vero Beach on the American mainland had been right:
‘Dead calm, light airs from the north-east, visibility good, no
immediate likelihood of change’ and a check on the fainter
Nassau Radio had confirmed. The sea looked as smooth and as
solid as steel. This was going to be all right. Petacchi dialled
Channel 67 on the pilot’s command set to pick up No 1’s
navigational aid. He had a moment’s panic when he didn’t hit
it at once, but then he got it, faint but clear—dot-dot-dash, dot-dot-dash.
It was time to get right down. Petacchi began to kill
his speed with the air brakes and cut down the four jets. The
great plane began a shallow dive. The radio altimeter became
vocal, threatening. Petacchi watched it and the sea of quicksilver
below him. He had a moment when the horizon was lost.
There was so much reflection off the moonlit water. Then he
was on and over a small dark island. It gave him confidence in
the 2,000 feet indicated on the altimeter. He pulled out of the
shallow dive and held the plane steady.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now No 1’s beacon was coming in loud and clear. Soon he
would see the red flashing light. And there it was, perhaps five
miles dead ahead. Petacchi inched the great nose of the plane
down. Any moment now! It was going to be easy! His fingers
played with the controls as delicately as if they were the erotic
trigger points on a woman. Five hundred feet, four hundred,
three, two . . . there was the pale shape of the yacht, lights
dowsed. He was dead on line with the red flash of the beacon.
Would he hit it? Never mind. Inch her down, down, down. Be
ready to switch off at once. The belly of the plane gave a jolt.
Up with the nose! Crash! A leap in the air and then . . .
Crash again!</p>

<p class="pindent">Petacchi unhinged his cramped fingers from the controls,
and gazed numbly out of the window at the foam and small
waves. By God he had done it! He, Giuseppe Petacchi, had
done it!</p>

<p class="pindent">Now for the applause! Now for the rewards!</p>

<p class="pindent">The plane was settling slowly and there was a hiss of steam
from the submerging jets. From behind him came the rip and
crack of tearing metal as the tail section gaped open where the
back of the plane had broken. Petacchi went through into the
fuselage. The water swirled around his feet. The filtering
moonlight glittered white on the upturned face of one of the
corpses now soggily awash at the rear of the plane. Petacchi
broke the perspex cover to the handle of the port side emergency
exit and jerked the handle down. The door fell outwards
and Petacchi stepped through and walked out along the wing.</p>

<p class="pindent">The big jolly-boat was almost up with the plane. There were
six men in it. Petacchi waved and shouted delightedly. One
man raised a hand in reply. The faces of the men, milk-white
under the moon, looked up at him quietly, curiously, Petacchi
thought: these men are very serious, very businesslike. It is
right so. He swallowed his triumph and also looked grave.</p>

<p class="pindent">The boat came alongside the wing, now almost awash, and
one man climbed up on the wing and walked towards him. He
was a short, thick man with a very direct gaze. He walked
carefully, his feet well apart and his knees flexed to keep his
balance. His left hand was hooked in his belt.</p>

<p class="pindent">Petacchi said happily, ‘Good evening. Good evening. I am
delivering one plane in good condition.’ (He had thought the
joke out long before.) ‘Please sign here.’ He held out his hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man from the jolly-boat took the hand in a strong grasp,
braced himself, and pulled sharply. Petacchi’s head was flung
back by the quick jerk and he was looking full into the eyes of
the moon as the stiletto flashed up and under the offered chin,
through the roof of the mouth, into the brain. He knew nothing
but a moment’s surprise, a sear of pain, and an explosion of
brilliant light.</p>

<p class="pindent">The killer held in the knife for a moment, the back of his
hand feeling the stubble on Petacchi’s chin, then he lowered
the body on to the wing and withdrew the knife. He carefully
rinsed the knife in the sea-water and wiped the blade on
Petacchi’s back and put the knife away. Then he hauled the
body along the wing and thrust it under water beside the
escape hatch.</p>

<p class="pindent">The killer waded back along the wing to the waiting jolly-boat
and laconically raised a thumb. By now four of the men
had pulled on their aqualungs. One by one, with a last adjustment
of their mouthpieces, they clumsily heaved themselves
over the side of the rocking boat and sank in a foam of small
bubbles. When the last man had gone, the mechanic at the
engine carefully lowered a huge underwater searchlight over
the side and paid out the cable. At a given moment he switched
the light on and the sea and the great sinking hulk of the plane
were lit up with a mist of luminescence. The mechanic slipped
the idling motor into gear and backed away, paying out cable as
he went. At twenty yards, out of range of the suction of the
sinking plane, he stopped and switched off his engine. He
reached into his overalls and took out a packet of Camels. He
offered one to the killer, who took it, broke it carefully in half,
put one half behind his ear and lit the other half.</p>

<p class="pindent">The killer was a man who rigidly controlled his weaknesses.</p>
