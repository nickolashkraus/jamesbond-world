<h3 class="calibre10"><span class="it1">Very Softly, Very Slowly</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> <span class="it">Disco</span>, a dark torpedo leaving a deep, briefly creaming
wake, hurtled across the indigo mirror of the sea. In the big
stateroom there was silence save for the dull boom of the
engines and the soft tinkle of a glass on the sideboard.
Although, as a precaution, the storm shutters were battened
down over the portholes, the only light inside came from a
single port navigation lantern hung from the roof. The dim
red light only just illuminated the faces of the twenty
men sitting round the long table, and the red-and-black-shadowed
features, contorting with the slight sway of the
top light, gave the scene the appearance of a conspiracy in
hell.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the top of the table Largo, his face, though the cabin was
air-conditioned, shining with sweat, began to speak. His voice
was tense and hoarse with strain. ‘I have to report that we are
in a state of emergency. Half an hour ago, No 17 found Miss
Vitali in the well-deck. She was standing fiddling with a
camera. When No 17 came upon her she lifted the camera and
pretended to take a photograph of Palmyra, although the
safety cap was over the lens. No 17 was suspicious. He
reported to me. I went below and took her to her cabin. She
struggled with me. Her whole attitude aroused my suspicions.
I was forced to subdue her by drastic measures. I took the
camera and examined it.’ Largo paused. He said quietly,
‘The camera was a fake. It concealed a Geiger counter. The
counter was, very naturally, registering over 500 milliroentgens.
I brought her back to consciousness and questioned her. She
refused to talk. In due course I shall force her to do so and
then she will be eliminated. It was time to sail. I again rendered
her unconscious and roped her securely to her bunk. I have
now summoned this meeting to acquaint you of this occurrence,
which I have already reported to No 2.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo was silent. A threatening, exasperated growl came
from round the table. No 14, one of the Germans, said through
his teeth, ‘And what, Mister No 1, did No 2 have to say about
this?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He said we were to carry on. He said the whole world is full
of Geiger counters looking for us. The secret services of the
whole world have been mobilized against us. Some busybody
in Nassau, the police probably, was perhaps ordered to have a
radiation search made of all ships in harbour. Perhaps Miss
Vitali was bribed to bring the counter on board. But No 2 said
that once we have placed the weapon in the target area there
will be nothing to fear. I have had the radio operator listening
for unusual traffic between Nassau and the Coast. The density
is quite normal. If we were suspected, Nassau would be
deluged with wireless traffic from London and Washington.
But all is quiet. So the operation will proceed as planned.
When we are well away from the area, we will dispose of the
lead casing of the weapon. The lead casing will contain Miss
Vitali.’</p>

<p class="pindent">No 14 persisted: ‘But you will first obtain the truth from this
woman? It is not pleasant for our future plans to think that we
may be under suspicion.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Interrogation will begin as soon as the meeting is over. If
you want my opinion, these two men who came on board
yesterday—this Bond and the man Larkin—may be involved.
They may be secret agents. The so-called Larkin had a
camera. I did not look at it closely, but it was similar to that
in the possession of Miss Vitali. I blame myself for not having
been more careful with these two men. But their story was
convincing. On our return to Nassau tomorrow morning, we
shall have to be circumspect. Miss Vitali will have fallen
overboard. I will work out the details of the story. There will
be an inquest. This will be irritating but nothing more. Our
witnesses will be unshakeable. It will be wise to use the coins
as additional alibi for our whereabouts tonight. No 5, is the
state of erosion of the coins satisfactory?’</p>

<p class="pindent">No 5, Kotze the physicist, said judiciously, ‘It is no more
than adequate. But they will pass examination, a cursory
examination. They are authentic doubloons and Reals of the
early seventeenth century. Sea water has no great effect on
gold and silver. I have used a little acid to pit them. They
will of course have to be handed to the coroner and declared
as treasure trove. It would need a far greater expert than he
or the court to pass judgement on them. There will be no
compulsion to reveal the location of the treasure. We could
perhaps give the depth of water—ten fathoms let us say,
and an unspecified reef. I see no means by which our story
could be upset. There is often very deep water outside reefs.
Miss Vitali could have had trouble with her aqualung and
could have been seen disappearing over the deep shelf where
our echo-sounder gave the depth as a hundred fathoms. We
did our best to dissuade her from taking part in the search.
But she was an expert swimmer. The romance of the occasion
was too much for her.’ No 5 opened his hands. ‘There are
often accidents of this nature. Many lives are lost in this way
every year. A thorough search was instituted, but there were
shark. The treasure hunt was broken off and we immediately
returned to Nassau to report the tragedy.’ No 5 shook his
head decisively. ‘I see no reason to be dismayed by this
occurrence. But I am in favour of a most rigorous interrogation.’
No 5 turned his head politely in Largo’s direction.
‘There are certain uses of electricity of which I have knowledge.
The human body cannot resist them. If I can be of any
service . . . ?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo’s voice was equally polite. They might have been discussing
remedies for a seasick passenger. ‘Thank you. I have
means of persuasion that I have found satisfactory in the past.
But I shall certainly call upon you if the case is an obstinate
one.’ Largo looked down the table into the shadowed, ruby
faces. ‘And now we will quickly run through the final details.’
He glanced down at his watch. ‘It is midnight. There will be
two hours’ moonlight starting at three am. The first light of
dawn will be shortly after five am. We thus have two hours for
the operation. Our course will bring us in towards West End
from the south. This is a normal entry to the islands, and even
if our further progress towards the target area is noted by the
missile station radar it will only be assumed that we are a yacht
that has strayed slightly off course. We shall anchor at exactly
three am and the swimming party will leave for the half-mile
swim to the laying point. The fifteen of you who will be
taking part in this swim will, as arranged, swim in arrow
formation, the Chariot and the sled with the missile in the
centre. Formation must be strictly kept to avoid straying.
The blue torch on my back should be an adequate beacon,
but if any man gets lost, he returns to the ship. Is that understood?
The first duty of the escort will be to watch for shark
and barracuda. I will again remind you that the range of your
guns is not much more than twenty feet and that fish must
be hit in or behind the head. Any man who is about to fire
must warn his neighbour, who will then stand by to give
additional fire if required. However, one hit should be sufficient
to kill if the curare is, as we have been informed, not affected
by the passage through sea-water. Above all,’ Largo put his
hands decisively down on the table before him, ‘do not forget
to remove the small protective sheath from the barb before
firing.’ Largo raised his hands. ‘You will forgive me for
repeating these points. We have had many exercises in similar
conditions and I have confidence that all will be well. But
the underwater terrain will be unfamiliar and the effect of the
dexedrine pills—they will be issued to the swimming party
after this meeting—will be to sensitize the nervous system as
well as provide the extra stamina and encouragement. So we
must all be prepared for the unexpected and know how to
handle it. Are there any further questions?’</p>

<p class="pindent">During the planning stages, months before in Paris, Blofeld
had warned Largo that if trouble was caused by any members
of his team it was to be expected from the two Russians, the
ex-members of <span class="g">SMERSH</span>, No 10 and No 11. ‘Conspiracy,’
Blofeld had said, ‘is their lifeblood. Hand in hand with conspiracy
walks suspicion. These two men will always be
wondering if they are not the object of some subsidiary plot—to
give them the most dangerous work, to make them fall-guys
for the police, to kill them and steal their share of the profits.
They will be inclined to inform against their colleagues and
always to have reservations about the plans that are agreed
upon. For them, the obvious plan, the right way to do a thing,
will have been chosen for some ulterior reason which is being
kept hidden from them. They will need constant reassurance
that nothing is being kept hidden from them, but, once they
have accepted their orders, they will carry them out meticulously
and without regard for their personal safety. Such men,
apart from their special talents, are worth having. But you will
please remember what I have said and, should there be
trouble, should they try and sow mistrust within the team, you
must act quickly and with utter ruthlessness. The maggots of
mistrust and disloyalty must not be allowed to get a hold in
your team. They are the enemies within that can destroy even
the most meticulous planning.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Now No 10, a once-famous <span class="g">SMERSH</span> terrorist called Strelik,
began talking. He was sitting two places away from Largo, on
his left. He did not address Largo, but the meeting. He said,
‘Comrades, I am thinking of the interesting matters recounted
by No 1, and I am telling myself that everything has been
excellently arranged. I am also thinking that this operation will
be a very fine one and that it will certainly not be necessary to
explode the second weapon on Target No 2. I have some
documentations on these islands and I am learning from the
<span class="it">Yachtsman’s</span> (No 10 had trouble with the word) <span class="it">Guide to the
Bahamas</span> that there is a big new hotel within a few miles of our
target site, also a scattered township. I am therefore estimating
that the explosion of Weapon No 1 will destroy perhaps two
thousand persons. Two thousand persons is not very many in
my country and their death, compared with the devastation of
this important missile station, would not, in the Soviet Union,
be considered of great importance. I am thinking that it will
be otherwise in the West and that the destruction of these
people and the rescuing of the survivors will be considered a
grave matter that will act decisively towards immediate
agreement with our terms and the saving of Target No 2 from
destruction. This being so, Comrades,’ the dull, flat voice
gained a trace of animation, ‘I am saying to myself that within
as little as twenty-four hours our labours will have been
completed and the great prize will be within our grasp. Now,
Comrades,’ the red and black shadows turned the taut little
smile into a dark grimace, ‘with so much money so near at
hand, a most unworthy thought has come into my mind.’
(Largo put his hand in his coat pocket and put up the safe on
the little Colt •25.) ‘And I would not be performing my duty
to my Russian comrade, No 11, nor to the other members of
our team if I did not share this thought with you at the same
time requesting forbearance for what may be unfounded
suspicions.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The meeting was very quiet, ominously so. These men had
all been secret agents or conspirators. They recognized the
smell of insurrection, the shadow of approaching disloyalty.
What did No 10 know? What was he going to divulge? Each
man got ready to decide very quickly which way to jump when
the cat was let out of the bag. Largo slipped the gun out of his
pocket and held it along his thigh.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There will come a moment,’ continued No 10, watching the
faces of the men opposite for a quick gauge of their reactions
‘very shortly, when fifteen of us, leaving five members and six
sub-agents on board this ship, will be out there,’ he waved a
hand at the cabin wall, ‘in the darkness, at least half an hour’s
swim from this ship. At that moment, Comrades,’ the voice
became sly, ‘what a thing it would be if those remaining on
board were to sail the ship away and leave us in the water.’
There was a shifting and muttering round the table. No 10
held up a hand. ‘Ridiculous, I am thinking, and so no doubt are
you, Comrades. But we are men of a feather. We recognize the
unworthy urges that can come upon even the best of friends
and comrades when fortunes are at stake. And, Comrades,
with fifteen of us gone, how much more of a fortune would
there be for those remaining, with their story for No 2 of a
great fight with sharks in which we all succumbed?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo said softly, ‘And what is it you propose, No. 10?’</p>

<p class="pindent">For the first time, No 10 looked to his right. He could not see
the expression in Largo’s eye. He spoke at the great red and
black mass of his face. The tone of his voice was obstinate. He
said, ‘I am proposing that one member of each national group
should stay on board to safeguard the interests of the other
members of his national group. That would reduce the
swimming party to ten. In this way those who are undertaking
this dangerous work would go about it with more enthusiasm
knowing that no such happening as I have mentioned could
come about.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo’s voice was polite, unemotional. He said, ‘I have one
very short and simple answer to your suggestion, No 10.’ The
light glittered redly on the metal thumb that protruded from
the big hand. The three bullets pumped so quickly into the
face of the Russian that the three explosions, the three bright
flashes, were almost one. No 10 put up two feeble hands,
palms forward, as if to catch any further bullets, gave a jerk
forward with his stomach at the edge of the table and then
crashed heavily backwards, in a splinter of chair wood, on to
the floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo put the muzzle of the gun up to his nose and delicately
sniffed at it, moving it to and fro under the nostrils as if it was
some delicious vial of perfume. In the silence, he looked slowly
down one rank of faces and up the other. Finally he said softly,
‘The meeting is now at an end. Will all members please return
to their cabins and look for a last time to their equipment. Food
will be ready from now on in the galley. One drink of alcohol
will also be available for those who want it. I will detail two
crew members to look after the late No 10. Thank you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">When Largo was alone he got to his feet, stretched, and gave
a great cavernous yawn. Then he turned to the sideboard,
opened a drawer and took out a box of Corona cigars. He
chose one and, with a gesture of distaste, lit it. He then took
the closed red rubber container that held the ice cubes and
walked out of the door and along to the cabin of Domino Vitali.</p>

<p class="pindent">He closed the door and locked it. Here also, a red riding light
hung from the ceiling. Under it, on the double bunk, the girl
lay offered like a starfish, her ankles and wrists strapped to the
four corners of the ironwork below the mattress. Largo put the
icebox down on the chest of drawers and balanced the cigar
carefully beside it so that the glowing tip would not spoil the
varnish.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl watched him, her eyes glittering red points in the
semi-darkness.</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo said, ‘My dear, I have had great enjoyment out of your
body, much pleasure. In return, unless you tell me who gave
you that machine to bring on board, I shall be forced to cause
you great pain. It will be caused with these two simple instruments,’
he held up the cigar and blew on the tip until it glowed
brightly, ‘this for heat, and these ice cubes for cold. Applied
scientifically, as I shall apply them, they will have the inevitable
effect of causing your voice, when it has stopped
screaming, to speak, and speak the truth. Now then. Which is [it]
to be?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl’s voice was deadly with hate. She said, ‘You killed
my brother and you will now kill me. Go on and enjoy yourself.
You are already a piece of death yourself. When the rest
of it comes, very soon, I pray God you will suffer a million
times more than both of us.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo’s laugh was a short, harsh bark. He walked over to the
edge of the bunk. He said, ‘Very well, my dear. We must see
what we can do with you, very softly and very, very slowly.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He bent down and hooked his fingers in the neckline of her
shirt and the join of the brassiere. Very slowly, but with great
force, he tore downwards, the whole length of her. Then he
threw aside the torn halves of material and exposed the whole
gleaming length of her body. He examined it carefully and
reflectively and then went to the chest of drawers and took the
cigar and the bowl of ice cubes and came back and made himself
comfortable on the edge of the bunk.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he took a puff at the cigar, knocked the ash off on to the
floor and leant forward.</p>
