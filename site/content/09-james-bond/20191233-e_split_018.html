<h3 class="calibre10"><span class="it1">Domino</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> <span class="lead-in">girl in</span> the sapphire blue <span class="s">MG</span> two-seater shot down
the slope of Parliament Street and at the junction with Bay
Street executed an admirable racing change through third into
second. She gave a quick glance to the right, correctly estimated
the trot of the straw-hatted horse in the shafts of the
rickety cab with the gay fringe, and swerved out of the side
street left-handed. The horse jerked back his head indignantly
and the coachman stamped his foot up and down on the big
Bermuda bell. The disadvantage of the beautiful deep ting-tong,
ting-long of the Bermuda carriage bell is that it cannot
possibly sound angry, however angrily you may sound it. The
girl gave a cheerful wave of a sunburned hand, raced up the
street in second, and stopped in front of The Pipe of Peace, the
Dunhills of Nassau.</p>

<p class="pindent">Not bothering to open the low door of the <span class="s">MG</span>, the girl
swung one brown leg and then the other over the side of the
car, showing her thighs under the pleated cream cotton skirt
almost to her waist, and slipped to the pavement. By now the
cab was alongside. The cabby reined in. He was mollified by
the gaiety and beauty of the girl. He said, ‘Missy, you done
almost shaved de whiskers off of Old Dreamy here. You wanna
be more careful.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl put her hands on her hips. She didn’t like being told
anything by anyone. She said sharply, ‘Old Dreamy yourself.
Some people have got work to do. Both of you ought to be put
out to grass instead of cluttering up the streets getting in everyone’s
way.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The ancient Negro opened his mouth, thought better of it,
said a pacifying ‘Hokay, Missy. Hokay’, flicked at his horse and
moved on, muttering to himself. He turned on his seat to get
another look at the she-devil, but she had already disappeared
into the shop. ‘Dat’s a fine piece of gal,’ he said inconsequentially,
and put his horse into an ambling trot.</p>

<p class="pindent">Twenty yards away, James Bond had witnessed the whole
scene. He felt the same way about the girl as the cabby did. He
also knew who she was. He quickened his step and pushed
through the striped sun-blinds into the blessed cool of the
tobacconist’s.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl was standing at a counter arguing with one of the
assistants. ‘But I tell you I don’t want Senior Service. I tell you
I want a cigarette that’s so disgusting that I shan’t want to
smoke it. Haven’t you got a cigarette that stops people smoking?
Look at all that.’ She waved a hand towards the stacked
shelves. ‘Don’t tell me some of those don’t taste horrible.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The man was used to crazy tourists and anyway the Nassavian
doesn’t get excited. He said, ‘Well, Mam . . .’ and
turned and languidly looked along the shelves.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said sternly to the girl, ‘You can choose between two
kinds of cigarette if you want to smoke less.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked sharply up at him. ‘And who might you be?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My name’s Bond, James Bond. I’m the world’s authority on
giving up smoking. I do it constantly. You’re lucky I happen to
be handy.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl looked him up and down. He was a man she hadn’t
seen before in Nassau. He was about six feet tall and somewhere
in his middle thirties. He had dark, rather cruel good looks and
very clear blue-grey eyes that were now observing her inspection
sardonically. A scar down his right cheek showed pale
against a tan so mild that he must have only recently come to
the island. He was wearing a very dark blue lightweight single-breasted
suit over a cream silk shirt and a black knitted silk tie.
Despite the heat, he looked cool and clean, and his only concession
to the tropics appeared to be the black saddle-stitched
sandals on his bare feet.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was an obvious attempt at a pick-up. He had an exciting
face, and authority. She decided to go along. But she wasn’t
going to make it easy. She said coldly, ‘All right. Tell me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The only way to stop smoking is to stop it and not start
again. If you want to <span class="it">pretend</span> to stop for a week or two, it’s no
good trying to ration yourself. You’ll become a bore and think
about nothing else. And you’ll snatch at a cigarette every time
the hour strikes or whatever the intervals may be. You’ll
behave greedily. That’s unattractive. The other way is to have
cigarettes that are either too mild or too strong. The mild ones
are probably the best for you.’ Bond said to the attendant. ‘A
carton of Dukes, king-size with filter.’ Bond handed them to the
girl. ‘Here, try these. With the compliments of Faust.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, but I can’t. I mean . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">But Bond had already paid for the carton and for a packet
of Chesterfields for himself. He took the change and followed
her out of the shop. They stood together under the striped
awning. The heat was terrific. The white light on the dusty
street, the glare reflected back off the shop fronts opposite
and off the dazzling limestone of the houses made them
both screw up their eyes. Bond said, ‘I’m afraid smoking goes
with drinking. Are you going to give them both up or one
by one?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked at him quizzically. ‘This is very sudden, Mr—er—Bond.
Well, all right. But somewhere out of the town. It’s too
hot here. Do you know The Wharf out beyond the Fort Montague?’
Bond noticed that she looked quickly up and down the
street. ‘It’s not bad. Come on. I’ll take you there. Mind the
metal. It’ll raise blisters on you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Even the white leather of the upholstery burned through to
Bond’s thighs. But he wouldn’t have minded if his suit had
caught fire. This was his first sniff at the town and already he
had got hold of the girl. And she was a fine girl at that. Bond
caught hold of the leather-bound safety grip on the dashboard
as the girl did a sharp turn up Frederick Street and another one
on to Shirley.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond settled himself sideways so that he could look at her.
She wore a gondolier’s broadrimmed straw hat, tilted impudently
down her nose. The pale blue tails of its ribbon streamed
out behind. On the front of the ribbon was printed in gold
‘<span class="s">MV DISCO VOLANTE</span>’. Her short-sleeved silk shirt
was in half-inch vertical stripes of pale blue and white and, with
the pleated cream skirt, the whole get-up reminded Bond
vaguely of a sunny day at Henley Regatta. She wore no rings and
no jewellery except for a rather masculine square gold wrist-watch
with a black face. Her flat-heeled sandals were of white
doeskin. They matched her broad white doeskin belt and the
sensible handbag that lay, with a black and white striped silk
scarf, on the seat between them. Bond knew a good deal about
her from the immigration form, one among a hundred, which
he had been studying that morning. Her name was Dominetta
Vitali. She had been born in Bolzano in the Italian Tyrol and
therefore probably had as much Austrian as Italian blood in
her. She was twenty-nine and gave her profession as ‘actress’.
She had arrived six months before in the <span class="it">Disco</span> and it was
entirely understood that she was mistress to the owner of the
yacht, an Italian called Emilio Largo. ‘Whore’, ‘tart’, ‘prostitute’
were not words Bond used about women unless they were
professional streetwalkers or the inmates of a brothel, and
when Harling, the Commissioner of Police, and Pitman, Chief
of Immigration and Customs, had described her as an ‘Italian
tart’ Bond had reserved judgement. Now he knew he had been
right. This was an independent, a girl of authority and
character. She might like the rich, gay life, but so far as Bond
was concerned, that was the right kind of girl. She might sleep
with men, obviously did, but it would be on her terms and
not on theirs.</p>

<p class="pindent">Women are often meticulous and safe drivers, but they are
very seldom first-class. In general Bond regarded them as a
mild hazard and he always gave them plenty of road and was
ready for the unpredictable. Four women in a car he regarded
as the highest potential danger, and two women nearly as
lethal. Women together cannot keep silent in a car, and when
women talk they have to look into each other’s faces. An
exchange of words is not enough. They have to see the other
person’s expression, perhaps in order to read behind the other’s
words or to analyse the reaction to their own. So two women in
the front seat of a car constantly distract each other’s attention
from the road ahead and four women are more than doubly
dangerous, for the driver not only has to hear, and see, what
her companion is saying, but also, for women are like that,
what the two behind are talking about.</p>

<p class="pindent">But this girl drove like a man. She was entirely focused on the
road ahead and on what was going on in her driving mirror, an
accessory rarely used by women except for making up their
faces. And, equally rare in a woman, she took a man’s pleasure
in the feel of her machine, in the timing of her gear changes,
and the use of her brakes.</p>

<p class="pindent">She didn’t talk to Bond or seem to be aware of him, and this
allowed him to continue his inspection without inhibition. She
had a gay, to-hell-with-you face that, Bond thought, would
become animal in passion. In bed she would fight and bite and
then suddenly melt into hot surrender. He could almost see the
proud, sensual mouth bare away from the even white teeth in a
snarl of desire and then, afterwards, soften into a half-pout of
loving slavery. In profile the eyes were soft charcoal slits such as
you see on some birds, but in the shop Bond had seen them full
face. Then they had been fierce and direct with a golden flicker
in the dark brown that held much the same message as the
mouth. The profile, the straight, small uptilted nose, the determined
set of the chin, and the clean-cut sweep of the jawline
were as decisive as a royal command, and the way the head was
set on the neck had the same authority—the poise one associates
with imaginary princesses. Two features modified the
clean-cut purity of line—a soft, muddled Brigitte Bardot
haircut that escaped from under the straw hat in endearing
disarray, and two deeply cut but soft dimples which could only
have been etched by a sweet if rather ironic smile that Bond
had not yet seen. The sunburn was not overdone and her skin
had none of that dried, exhausted sheen that can turn the
texture of even the youngest skin into something more like
parchment. Beneath the gold, there was an earthy warmth in
the cheeks that suggested a good healthy peasant strain from
the Italian Alps and her breasts, high-riding and deeply V-ed,
were from the same stock. The general impression, Bond
decided, was of a wilful, high-tempered, sensual girl—a beautiful
Arab mare who would only allow herself to be ridden by a
horseman with steel thighs and velvet hands, and then only
with curb and saw bit—and then only when he had broken
her to bridle and saddle. Bond thought that he would like to
try his strength against hers. But that must be for some other
time. For the moment another man was in the saddle. He
would first have to be unhorsed. And anyway, what the hell
was he doing fooling with these things? There was a job to be
done. The devil of a job.</p>

<p class="pindent">The <span class="s">MG</span> swept out of Shirley Street on to Eastern Road and
followed the coast. Across the wide harbour entrance were the
emerald and turquoise shoals of Athol Island. A deep-sea
fishing boat was passing over them, the two tall antennae of her
twelve-foot rods streaming their lines astern. A fast motor-boat
came hammering by close in shore, the water-skier on the line
behind her executing tight slaloms across the waves of her
wake. It was a sparkling, beautiful day and Bond’s heart lifted
momentarily from the trough of indecision and despondency
created by an assignment that, particularly since his arrival at
dawn that day, seemed increasingly time-wasting and futile.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Bahamas, the string of a thousand islands that straggle
five hundred miles south-east from just east of the coast of
Florida to just north of Cuba, from latitude 27° down to
latitude 21°, were, for most of three hundred years, the haunt of
every famous pirate of the Western Atlantic, and today
tourism makes full use of the romantic mythology. A road sign
said ‘<span class="it">Blackbeard’s Tower 1 mile</span>’ and another ‘<span class="it">Gunpowder Wharf.
Sea Food. Native Drinks. Shady Garden, First Left</span>’.</p>

<p class="pindent">A sand track showed on their left. The girl took it and pulled
up in front of a ruined stone warehouse against which leant a
pink clapboard house with white window-frames and a white
Adam style doorway over which hung a brightly painted inn
sign of a powder keg with a skull and crossbones on it. The girl
drove the <span class="s">MG</span> into the shade of a clump of casuarinas and
they got out and went through the door and through a small
dining-room with red and white checked covers and out on to a
terrace built on the remains of a stone wharf. The terrace was
shaded by sea-almond trees trimmed into umbrellas. Trailed
by a shuffling coloured waiter with soup stains down his white
coat, they chose a cool table on the edge of the terrace looking
over the water. Bond glanced at his watch. He said to the girl,
‘It’s exactly midday. Do you want to drink solid or soft?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl said, ‘Soft. I’ll have a double Bloody Mary with
plenty of Worcester sauce.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, ‘What do you call hard? I’ll have a vodka and
tonic with a dash of bitters.’ The waiter said, ‘Yassuh,’ and
mooched away.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I call vodka-on-the-rocks hard. All that tomato juice makes
it soft.’ She hooked a chair towards her with one foot and
stretched out her legs on it so that they were in the sun. The
position wasn’t comfortable enough. She kicked off her sandals
and sat back, satisfied. She said. ‘When did you arrive? I
haven’t seen you about. When it’s like this, at the end of the
season, one expects to know most of the faces.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I got in this morning. From New York. I’ve come to look for
a property. It struck me that now would be better than in the
season. When all the millionaires are here the prices are hopeless.
They may come down a bit now they’re gone. How long
have you been here?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘About six months. I came out in a yacht, the <span class="it">Disco Volante</span>.
You may have seen her. She’s anchored up the coast. You
probably flew right over her coming in to land at Windsor
Field.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A long low streamlined affair? Is she yours? She’s got
beautiful lines.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘She belongs to a relative of mine.’ The eyes watched
Bond’s face.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Do you stay on board?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh no. We’ve got a beach property. Or rather we’ve taken it.
It’s a place called Palmyra. Just opposite where the yacht is. It
belongs to an Englishman. I believe he wants to sell it. It’s very
beautiful. And it’s a long way away from the tourists. It’s at a
place called Lyford Key.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That sounds the sort of place I’m looking for.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, we’ll be gone in about a week.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh.’ Bond looked into her eyes. ‘I’m sorry.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If you’ve got to flirt, don’t be obvious.’ Suddenly the girl
laughed. She looked contrite. The dimples remained. ‘I mean, I
didn’t really mean that—not the way it sounded. But I’ve spent
six months listening to that kind of thing from these silly old
rich goats and the only way to shut them up is to be rude. I’m
not being conceited. There’s no one under sixty in this place.
Young people can’t afford it. So any woman who hasn’t got a
harelip or a moustache—well not even a moustache would put
them off. They’d probably like it. Well I mean absolutely any
girl makes these old goats get their bifocals all steamed up.’ She
laughed again. She was getting friendly. ‘I expect you’ll have
just the same effect on the old women with pince-nez and
blue rinses.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Do they eat boiled vegetables for lunch?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, and they drink carrot juice and prune juice.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We won’t get on then. I won’t sink lower than conch
chowder.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked at him curiously. ‘You seem to know a lot about
Nassau.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You mean about conch being an aphrodisiac? That’s not
only a Nassau idea. It’s all over the world where there are
conchs.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Is it true?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Island people have it on their wedding night. I haven’t
found it have any effect on me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Why?’ She looked mischievous. ‘Are you married?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No.’ Bond smiled across into her eyes. ‘Are you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Then we might both try some conch soup some time and see
what happens.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s only a little better than the millionaires. You’ll have
to try harder.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The drinks came. The girl stirred hers with a finger, to mix
in the brown sediment of Worcester sauce, and drank half of it.
She reached for the carton of Dukes, broke it open, and slit a
packet with her thumbnail. She took out a cigarette, sniffed it
cautiously, and lit it with Bond’s lighter. She inhaled deeply
and blew out a long plume of smoke. She said doubtfully, ‘Not
bad. At least the smoke looks like smoke. Why did you say
you were such an expert on giving up smoking?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Because I’ve given it up so often.’ Bond thought it time to
get away from the small-talk. He said, ‘Why do you talk such
good English? Your accent sounds Italian.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, my name’s Dominetta Vitali. But I was sent to school
in England. To the Cheltenham Ladies College. Then I went to
<span class="g">RADA</span> to learn acting. The English kind of acting. My parents
thought that was a ladylike way to be brought up. Then they
were both killed in a train crash. I went back to Italy to earn my
living. I remembered my English but’—she laughed without
bitterness—‘I soon forgot most of the rest. You don’t get far in
the Italian theatre by being able to walk about with a book
balanced on your head.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But this relative with the yacht.’ Bond looked out to sea.
‘Wasn’t he there to look after you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No.’ The answer was curt. When Bond made no comment
she added, ‘He’s not exactly a relative, not a close one. He’s a
sort of close friend. A guardian.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh yes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You must come and visit us on the yacht.’ She felt that a bit
of gush was needed. ‘He’s called Largo, Emilio Largo. You’ve
probably heard. He’s here on some kind of a treasure hunt.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Really?’ Now it was Bond’s turn to gush. ‘That sounds
rather fun. Of course I’d like to meet him. What’s it all about?
Is there anything in it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Heaven knows. He’s very secretive about it. Apparently
there’s some kind of a map. But I’m not allowed to see it and I
have to stay ashore when he goes off prospecting or whatever he
does. A lot of people have put up money for it, sort of shareholders.
They’ve all just arrived. As we’re going in a week or so,
I suppose everything’s ready and the real hunt’s going to start
any moment now.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What are the shareholders like? Do they seem sensible sort
of people? The trouble with most treasure hunts is that either
someone’s been there before and sneaked off with the treasure
or the ship’s so deep in the coral you can’t get at it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘They seem all right. Very dull and rich. Terribly serious for
something as romantic as treasure-hunting. They seem to spend
all their time with Largo. Plotting and planning I suppose. And
they never seem to go out in the sun or go bathing or anything.
It’s as if they didn’t want to get sunburned. As far as I can
gather, none of them have ever been in the tropics before. Just a
typical bunch of stuffy businessmen. They’re probably better
than that. I haven’t seen much of them. Largo’s giving a party
for them at the Casino tonight.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What do you do all day?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, I fool around. Do a bit of shopping for the yacht. Drive
around in the car. Bathe on other people’s beaches when their
houses are empty. I like underwater swimming. I’ve got an
aqualung and I take one of the crew out or a fisherman. The
crew are better. They all do it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I used to do it a bit. I’ve brought my gear. Will you show me
some good bits of reef some time?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl looked pointedly at her watch. ‘I might do. It’s time
I went.’ She got up. ‘Thanks for the drink. I’m afraid I can’t
take you back. I’m going the other way. They’ll get you a
taxi here.’ She shuffled her feet into her sandals.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond followed the girl through the restaurant to her car. She
got in and pressed the starter. Bond decided to risk another
snub. He said, ‘Perhaps I’ll see you at the Casino tonight,
Dominetta.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘P’raps.’ She put the car pointedly into gear. She took
another look at him. She decided that she did want to see him
again. She said, ‘But for God’s sake don’t call me Dominetta.
I’m never called that. People call me Domino.’ She gave him a
brief smile, but it was a smile into the eyes. She raised a hand.
The rear wheels spat sand and gravel and the little blue car
whirled out along the driveway to the main road. It paused at
the intersection and then, as Bond watched, turned right-handed
towards Nassau.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled. He said, ‘Bitch,’ and walked back into the
restaurant to pay his bill and have a taxi called.</p>
