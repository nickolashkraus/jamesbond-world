<h3 class="calibre10">‘<span class="it1">Big Fleas have Little Fleas . . .</span>’</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">B</span>ond</span> <span class="lead-in">said</span>, ‘What is there to go on, sir?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Damned little, practically speaking nothing. Nobody’s
ever heard of these <span class="g">SPECTRE</span> people. We know there’s some
kind of independent unit working in Europe—we’ve bought
some stuff from them, so have the Americans, and Mathis
admits now that Goltz, that French heavy-water scientist who
went over last year, was assassinated by them, for big money,
as a result of an offer he got out of the blue. No names were
mentioned. It was all done on the radio, the same 16 megacycles
that’s mentioned in the letter. To the Deuxième Communications
section. Mathis accepted on the off-chance. They
did a neat job. Mathis paid up—a suitcase full of money left at a
Michelin road sign on N1. But no one can tie them in with these
<span class="g">SPECTRE</span> people. When we and the Americans dealt, there
were endless cutouts, really professional ones, and anyway we
were more interested in the end product than the people
involved. We both paid a lot of money, but it was worth it.
If it’s the same group working this, they’re a serious outfit
and I’ve told the <span class="s">PM</span> so. But that’s not the point. The plane
is missing and the two bombs, just as the letter says. All details
exactly correct. The Vindicator was on a <span class="g">NATO</span> training flight
south of Ireland and out into the Atlantic.’ M reached for a
bulky folder and turned over some pages. He found what he
wanted. ‘Yes, it was to be a six-hour flight leaving Boscombe
Down at eight pm and due back at two am. There was an <span class="s">RAF</span>
crew of five and a <span class="g">NATO</span> observer, an Italian man called
Petacchi, Giuseppe Petacchi, squadron leader in the Italian Air
Force, seconded to <span class="g">NATO</span>. Fine flyer, apparently, but they’re
checking on his background now. He was sent over here on a
normal tour of duty. The top pilots from <span class="g">NATO</span> have been
coming over for months to get used to the Vindicator and the
bomb-release routines. This plane’s apparently going to be used
for the <span class="g">NATO</span> long range striking force. Anyway,’ M turned
over a page, ‘the plane was watched on the screen as usual and
all went well until it was west of Ireland at about 40,000 feet.
Then, contrary to the drill, it came down to around 30,000 and
got lost in the transatlantic air traffic. Bomber Command tried
to get in touch, but the radio couldn’t or wouldn’t answer. The
immediate reaction was that the Vindicator had hit one of the
transatlantic planes and there was something of a panic. But
none of the companies reported any trouble or even a sighting.’
M looked across at Bond. ‘And that was the end of it. The plane
just vanished.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, ‘Did the American <span class="g">DEW</span> line pick it up—their
Distant Early Warning system?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There’s a query on that. The only grain of evidence we’ve
got. Apparently about five hundred miles east of Boston there
was some evidence that a plane had peeled off the inward route
to Idlewild and turned south. But that’s another big traffic lane—for
the northern traffic from Montreal and Gander down to
Bermuda and the Bahamas and South America. So these <span class="g">DEW</span>
operators just put it down as a <span class="s">BOAC</span> or Trans-Canada plane.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It certainly sounds as if they’ve got the whole thing worked
out pretty well, hiding in these traffic lanes. Could the plane
have turned northwards in the middle of the Atlantic and made
for Russia?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, or southwards. There’s a big block of space about
500 miles out from both shores that’s out of radar range.
Better still, it could have turned on its tracks and come back
into Europe on any of two or three air-lanes. In fact it
could be almost anywhere in the world by now. That’s the
point.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But it’s a huge plane. It must need special runways and so
on. It must have come down somewhere. You can’t hide a plane
of that size.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Just so. All these things are obvious. By midnight last night
the <span class="s">RAF</span> had checked with every single airport, every one in
the world, that could have taken it. Negative. But the <span class="s">CAS</span> says
of course it could be crash-landed in the Sahara for instance, or
on some other desert, or in the sea, in shallow water.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Wouldn’t that explode the bombs?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No. They’re absolutely safe until they’re armed. Apparently
even a direct drop, like that one from the B-47 over North
Carolina in 1958, would only explode the <span class="s">TNT</span> trigger to the
thing. Not the plutonium.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How are these <span class="g">SPECTRE</span> people going to explode them
then?’</p>

<p class="pindent">M spread his hands. ‘They explained all this at the War
Cabinet meeting. I don’t understand it all, but apparently an
atomic bomb looks just like any other bomb. The way it works
is that the nose is full of ordinary <span class="s">TNT</span> with the plutonium in
the tail. Between the two there’s a hole into which you screw
some sort of a detonator, a kind of plug. When the bomb hits,
the <span class="s">TNT</span> ignites the detonator and the detonator sets off the
plutonium.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So these people would have to drop the bomb to set it off?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Apparently not. They would need a man with good physics
knowledge who understood the thing, but then all he’d have to
do would be to unscrew the nose cone on the bomb—the ordinary
detonator that sets off the <span class="s">TNT</span>—and fix on some kind of
time fuse that would ignite the <span class="s">TNT</span> without it being dropped.
That would set the thing off. And it’s not a very bulky affair.
You could get the whole thing into something only about twice
the size of a big golf-bag. Very heavy, of course. But you
could put it into the back of a big car, for instance, and just run
the car into a town and leave it parked with the time fuse
switched on. Give yourself a couple of hours’ start to get out of
range—at least 100 miles away—and that would be that.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond reached in his pocket for another cigarette. It couldn’t
be, yet it was so. Just what his Service and all the other intelligence
services in the world had been expecting to happen. The
anonymous little man in the raincoat with a heavy suitcase—or
golf-bag, if you like. The left luggage office, the parked car, the
clump of bushes in a park in the centre of a big town. And there
was no answer to it. In a few years’ time, if the experts were
right, there would be even less answer to it. Every tin-pot little
nation would be making atomic bombs in their backyards, so to
speak. Apparently there was no secret now about the things. It
had only been the prototypes that had been difficult—like the
first gunpowder weapons for instance, or machine-guns or
tanks. Today these were everybody’s bows and arrows.
Tomorrow, or the day after, the bows and arrows would be
atomic bombs. And this was the first blackmail case. Unless
<span class="g">SPECTRE</span> was stopped, the word would get round and soon
every criminal scientist with a chemical set and some scrap
iron would be doing it. If they couldn’t be stopped in time
there would be nothing for it but to pay up. Bond said so.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s about it,’ commented M. ‘From every point of view,
including politics, not that they matter all that much. But
neither the <span class="s">PM</span> nor the President would last five minutes if
anything went wrong. But whether we pay or don’t pay, the
consequences will be endless—and all bad. That’s why
absolutely everything has got to be done to find these people
and the plane and stop the thing in time. The <span class="s">PM</span> and the
President are entirely agreed. Every intelligence man all over
the world who’s on our side is being put on to this operation—Operation
<span class="it">Thunderball</span> they’re calling it. Planes, ships, submarines—and
of course money’s no object. We can have
everything, whenever we want it. The Cabinet have already
set up a special staff and a war-room. Every scrap of information
will be fed into it. The Americans have done the same.
Some kind of a leak can’t be helped. It’s being put about that
all the panic, and it is panic, is because of the loss of the
Vindicator—bombs included, whatever fuss that may cause
politically. Only the letter will be absolutely secret. All the usual
detective work—finger-prints, Brighton, writing paper—these’ll
be looked after by Scotland Yard with the <span class="s">FBI</span>, Interpol,
and all the <span class="g">NATO</span> intelligence organizations helping where
they can. Only a segment of the paper and the typing will be
used—a few innocent words. This will all be quite separate
from the search for the plane. That’ll be handled as a top
espionage matter. No one should be able to connect the two
investigations. <span class="g">MI5</span> will handle the background to all the crew
members and the Italian observer. That will be a natural part
of the search for the plane. As for the Service, we’ve teamed up
with the <span class="s">CIA</span> to cover the world. Allen Dulles is putting every
man he’s got on to it and so am I. Just sent out a General Call.
Now all we can do is sit back and wait.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond lit another cigarette, his sinful third in one hour. He
said, putting unconcern into his voice, ‘Where do I come in,
sir?’</p>

<p class="pindent">M looked vaguely at Bond, as if seeing him for the first time.
Then he swivelled his chair, and gazed again through the
window at nothing. Finally he said, in a conversational tone of
voice, ‘I have committed a breach of faith with the <span class="s">PM</span> in
telling you all this, 007. I was under oath to tell no one what I
have just told you. I decided to do what I have done because I
have an idea, a hunch, and I wish this idea to be pursued by a’—he
hesitated—‘by a reliable man. It seemed to me that the
only grain of possible evidence in this case was the <span class="g">DEW</span> radar
plot, a doubtful one I admit, of the plane that left the East-West
air channel over the Atlantic and turned south towards
Bermuda and the Bahamas. I decided to accept this evidence,
although it has not aroused much interest elsewhere. I then
spent some time studying a map and charts of the Western
Atlantic and I endeavoured to put myself in the minds of
<span class="g">SPECTRE</span>—or rather, for there is certainly a master mind behind
all this, in the mind of the chief of <span class="g">SPECTRE</span>: my opposite
number, so to speak. And I came to certain conclusions. I
decided that a favourable target for Bomb No 1, and for Bomb
No 2, if it comes to that, would be in America rather than in
Europe. To begin with, the Americans are more bomb-conscious
than we in Europe and therefore more susceptible to
persuasion if it came to using Bomb No 2. Installations worth
more than £100,000,000, and thus targets for Bomb No 1, are
more numerous in America than in Europe, and finally guessing
that <span class="g">SPECTRE</span> is a European organization, from the style of
the letter and from the paper, which is Dutch by the way, and
also from the ruthlessness of the plot, it seemed to me at least
possible that an American rather than a European target might
have been chosen. Anyway, going on these assumptions, and
assuming that the plane could not have landed in America itself
or off American shores—the coastal radar network is too good—I
looked for a neighbouring area which might be suitable.
And,’ M glanced round at Bond and away again, ‘I decided
on the Bahamas, the group of islands, many of them uninhabited,
surrounded mostly by shoal water over sand and
possessing only one simple radar station—and that one concerned
only with civilian air traffic and manned by local
civilian personnel. South, towards Cuba, Jamaica, and the
Caribbean, offers no worthwhile targets. Anyway it is too far
from the American coastline. Northwards towards Bermuda
has the same disadvantages. But the nearest of the Bahama
group is only 200 miles—only six or seven hours in a fast
motor-boat or yacht—from the American coastline.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond interrupted. ‘If you’re right, sir, why didn’t <span class="g">SPECTRE</span>
send their letter to the President instead of the <span class="s">PM</span>?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘For the sake of obscurity. To make us do what we are doing—hunting
all round the world instead of only in one part of it.
And for maximum impact. <span class="g">SPECTRE</span> would realize that the
arrival of the letter right on top of the loss of the bomber would
hit us in the solar plexus. It might, they would reason, even
shake the money out of us without any further effort. The next
stage of their operation, attacking target No 1, is going to be a
nasty business for them. It’s going to expose their whereabouts
to a considerable extent. They’d like to collect the money and
close the operation as quickly as possible. That’s what we’ve
got to gamble on. We’ve got to push them as close to the use of
No 1 bomb as we dare in the hope that something will betray
them in the next six and three-quarter days. It’s a slim chance.
I’m pinning my hopes on my guess’—M swung his chair round
to the desk—‘and on you. Well,’ he looked hard at Bond. ‘Any
comments? If not you’d better get started. You’re booked on
all New York planes from now until midnight. Then on by
<span class="s">BOAC</span>. I thought of using an <span class="s">RAF</span> Canberra, but I don’t
want your arrival to make any noise. You’re a rich young man
looking for some property in the islands. That’ll give you an
excuse to do as much prospecting as you want. Well?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right, sir.’ Bond got to his feet. ‘I’d rather have had somewhere
more interesting—the Iron Curtain beat for instance. I
can’t help feeling this is a bigger operation than a small unit
could take on. For my money this looks more like a Russian
job. They get the experimental plane and the bombs—they
obviously want them—and throw dust in our eyes with all this
<span class="g">SPECTRE</span> ballyhoo. If <span class="g">SMERSH</span> was still in business, I’d say
they’d got a finger in it somewhere. Just their style. But the
Eastern Stations may pick up something on that if there’s
anything in the idea. Anything else, sir? Who do I cooperate
with in Nassau?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The Governor knows you’re coming. They’ve got a well-trained
police force. <span class="s">CIA</span> are sending down a good man, I
gather. With a communications outfit. They’ve got more of that
sort of machinery than we have. Take a cipher machine with the
Triple X setting. I want to hear every single detail you turn up.
Personal to me. Right?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Right, sir.’ Bond went to the door and let himself out. There
was nothing more to be said. This looked like the biggest job
the Service had ever been given and, in Bond’s opinion, for he
didn’t give much for M’s guess, he had been relegated to the
back row of the chorus. So be it. He would get himself a good
sunburn and watch the show from the wings.</p>

<p class="line10">★</p>

<p class="pindent">When Bond walked out of the building, carrying the neat
leather cipher case, an expensive movie camera perhaps, slung
over his shoulder, the man in the beige Volkswagen stopped
scratching the burn-scab under his shirt, loosened, for the
tenth time, the long-barrelled forty-five in the holster under
his arm, started the car and put it in gear. He was twenty yards
behind Bond’s parked Bentley. He had no idea what the big
building was. He had simply obtained Bond’s home address
from the receptionist at Shrublands and, as soon as he got out
of the Brighton hospital, he had carefully tailed Bond. The car
was hired, under an assumed name. When he had done what
had to be done he would go straight to London Airport and
take the first plane out to any country on the Continent. Count
Lippe was a sanguine individual. The job, the private score he
had to settle, presented no problem to him. He was a ruthless,
vengeful man and he had eliminated many obstreperous and
perhaps dangerous people in his life. He reasoned that, if they
ever came to hear of this, <span class="g">SPECTRE</span> would not object. The
overheard telephone conversation on that first day at the clinic
showed that his cover had been broached, however slightly,
and it was just conceivable that he could be traced through his
membership of the Red Lightning Tong. From there to
<span class="g">SPECTRE</span> was a long step, but Sub-operator G knew that once
a cover began to run, it ran like an old sock. Apart from that,
this man must be paid off. Count Lippe had to be quits with
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was getting into his car. He had slammed the door.
Sub-operator G watched the blue smoke curl from the twin
exhausts. He got moving.</p>

<p class="pindent">On the other side of the road, and a hundred yards behind
the Volkswagen, <span class="g">SPECTRE</span> No 6 slipped his goggles down over
his eyes, stamped the 500-cc. Triumph into gear and accelerated
down the road. He swerved neatly through the traffic—he
had been a test rider for <span class="s">DKW</span> at one time in his post-war
career—and stationed himself ten yards behind the off rear
wheel of the Volkswagen and just out of the driver’s line [of]
vision in the windscreen mirror. He had no idea why Sub-operator
G was following the Bentley, nor who the Bentley
belonged to. His job was to kill the driver of the Volkswagen.
He put his hand into the leather satchel he carried slung over
his shoulder, took out the heavy grenade—it was twice the
normal military size—and watched the traffic ahead for the
right pattern to allow his getaway.</p>

<p class="pindent">Sub-operator G was watching for a similar pattern. He also
noted the spacing on the lamp-posts on the pavement in case he
might be blocked and have to run off the road. Now the cars
ahead were sparse. He stamped his foot into the floor and
driving with his left hand, drew out the Colt with his right.
Now he was up with the Bentley’s rear bumper. Now he was
alongside. The dark profile was a sitting target. With a last
quick glance ahead, he raised the gun.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was the cheeky iron rattle of the Volkswagen’s air-cooled
engine that made Bond turn his head, and it was this minute reduction
of the target area that saved his jaw. If he had then
accelerated, the second bullet would have got him, but some
blessed instinct made his foot stamp the brake at the same time
as his head ducked so swiftly that his chin hit the horn button,
nearly knocking him out. Almost simultaneously, instead of a
third shot, there came the roar of an explosion and the remains
of his windshield, already shattered, cascaded around him. The
Bentley had stopped, the engine stalled. Brakes screamed.
There were shouts and the panicky screams of horns. Bond
shook his head and cautiously raised it. The Volkswagen, one
wheel still spinning, lay on its side in front of and broadside to
the Bentley. Most of the roof had been blown off. Inside, and
half sprawling into the road, was a horrible, glinting mess.
Flames were licking at the blistered paintwork. People were
gathering. Bond pulled himself together and got quickly out
of his car. He shouted, ‘Stand back. The petrol tank’ll go.’
Almost as he said the words there came a dull boom and a cloud
of black smoke. The flames spurted. In the distance, sirens
sounded. Bond edged through the people and strode quickly
back towards his headquarters, his thoughts racing.</p>

<p class="pindent">The inquiry made Bond lose two planes to New York. By the
time the police had put out the fire and had transported the bits
of man and the bits of machinery and bomb casing to the
morgue it was quite clear that they would have nothing to go
on but the shoes, the number on the gun, some fibres and
shreds of clothing, and the car. The car-hire people remembered
nothing but a man with dark glasses, a driver’s licence
in the name of Johnston, and a handful of fivers. The car had
been hired three days before for one week. Plenty of people
remembered the motor-cyclist, but it seemed that he had no
rear number plate. He had gone like a bat out of hell towards
Baker Street. He wore goggles. Medium build. Nothing else.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had not been able to help. He had seen nothing of the
Volkswagen driver. The roof of the Volkswagen had been too
low. There had only been a hand and the glitter of a gun.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Secret Service asked for a copy of the police report and
M instructed that this should be sent to the Thunderball
war-room. He saw Bond briefly again, rather impatiently, as if it
had all been Bond’s fault. Then he told Bond to forget about
it—it was probably something to do with one of his past cases.
A hangover of some kind. The police would get to the bottom
of it in time. The main thing was operation Thunderball. Bond
had better get a move on.</p>

<p class="pindent">By the time Bond left the building for the second time, it had
begun to rain. One of the mechanics from the car pool at the
back of the building had done what he could, knocking out the
remains of the Bentley’s windscreen and cleaning the bits out
of the car, but when he got home at lunch-time Bond was
soaked to the skin. He left the car in a near-by garage, telephoned
Rolls and his insurance company (he had got too close
to a lorry carrying steel lengths, for reinforced concrete presumably.
No, he had not got the lorry’s number. Sorry, but
you know how it is when these things happen all of a sudden),
and then went home and had a bath and changed into his dark
blue tropical worsted. He packed carefully—one large suitcase
and a holdall for his underwater swimming gear—and went
through to the kitchen.</p>

<p class="pindent">May was looking rather contrite. It seemed as if she might
make another speech. Bond held up his hand. ‘Don’t tell me,
May. You were right. I can’t do my work on carrot juice. I’ve
got to be off in an hour and I need some proper food. Be an
angel and make me your kind of scrambled eggs—four eggs.
Four rashers of that American hickory-smoked bacon if we’ve
got any left, hot buttered toast—your kind, not wholemeal—and
a big pot of coffee, double strength. And bring in the drink
tray.’</p>

<p class="pindent">May looked at him, relieved but aghast. ‘Whatever happened,
Mister James?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed at the expression of her face. ‘Nothing, May.
It just occurred to me that life’s too short. Plenty of time to
watch the calories when one gets to heaven.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond left May tut-tutting at this profanity, and went off to
look to his armament.</p>
