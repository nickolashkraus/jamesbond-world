<h3 class="calibre10"><span class="it1">How to Eat a Girl</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s</span> <span class="lead-in">they approached</span> Nassau on their way back, Bond
asked Leiter to take a look at the <span class="it">Disco</span> lying off Palmyra.
She was there all right, just where she had been the day before.
The only difference, which had little meaning, was that she
had only her bow anchor out. There was no movement on
board. Bond was thinking that she looked beautiful and quite
harmless lying there reflecting her elegant lines in the mirror
of the sea, when Leiter said excitedly, ‘Say, James, take a look
at the beach place. The boathouse alongside the creek. See
those double tracks leading up out of the water? Up to the
door of the boathouse. They look odd to me. They’re deep.
What could have made them?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond focused his glasses. The tracks ran parallel. Something,
something heavy, had been hauled between the boathouse and
the sea. But it couldn’t be, surely it couldn’t! He said tensely,
‘Let’s get away quick, Felix.’ Then, as they zoomed off overland,
‘I’m damned if I can think of anything that could have
made those. And dammit, if it was what it might have been,
they’d have swept off those tracks pretty quick.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter said laconically, ‘People make mistakes. We’ll have to
give that place the going over. Ought to have done it before.
Nice looking dump. I think I’ll take Mr Largo up on his invitation
and get out there on behalf of my esteemed client, Mr
Rockefeller Bond.’</p>

<p class="pindent">It was one o’clock by the time they got back to Windsor
Field. For half an hour the control tower had been searching
for them on the radio. Now they had to face the commandant of
the field and, providentially as it happened, the Governor’s
<span class="s">ADC</span>, who gave the Governor’s blanket authorization for
the string of their misdemeanours and then handed Bond
a thick envelope which contained signals for both of
them.</p>

<p class="pindent">The contents began with the expected rockets for breaking
communication and demands for further news (‘That they’ll
get!’ commented Leiter as they raced towards Nassau in the
comfortable back of the Governor’s Humber Snipe saloon.)
<span class="s">ETA</span> for the <span class="it">Manta</span> was five o’clock that evening. Inquiries
through Interpol and the Italian police confirmed that
Giuseppe Petacchi was in fact the brother of Dominetta Vitali,
whose personal history as given to Bond stood up in all other
respects. The same sources confirmed that Emilio Largo was a
big-time adventurer and suspected crook though technically
his dossier was clean. The source of his wealth was unknown
but did not stem from funds held in Italy. The <span class="it">Disco</span> had been
paid for in Swiss francs. The constructors confirmed the
existence of the underwater compartment. It contained an
electric hoist and provision for launching small underwater
craft and releasing skin-divers. In Largo’s specifications, this
modification to the hull had been given as a requirement for
underwater research. Further inquiry into the ‘shareholders’
had yielded no further facts—with the significant exception
that most of their backgrounds and professions dated back no
further than six years. This suggested the possibility that their
identities might be of recent fabrication and, at any rate in
theory, this would equate with possible membership of
<span class="g">SPECTRE</span>, if such a body did in fact exist. Kotze had left
Switzerland for an unknown destination four weeks previously.
Latest photographs of the man were on the midday
Pan American plane. Nevertheless the Thunderball war-room
had to accept the solidity of Largo’s cover unless further
evidence came to hand, and the present intention was to continue
the world-wide search while allotting priority to the
Bahamas area. In view of this priority, and the extremely
urgent time factor, Brigadier Fairchild, <span class="g">CB</span>, <span class="g">DSO</span>, British
Military Attaché in Washington, with Rear Admiral Carlson,
<span class="s">USN</span> Ret., until recently Secretary to the <span class="s">US</span> Chiefs of Staff
Committee, would be arriving at 1900 <span class="s">EST</span> by the President’s
Boeing 707, ‘Columbine’, to take joint command of further
operations. The full co-operation of Messrs Bond and
Leiter was requested and, until the arrival of above named
officers, full reports every hour on the hour were to be
radio’d to London, copy to Washington, under joint
signature.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter and Bond looked at each other in silence. Finally
Leiter said, ‘James, I propose we disregard the last bit and take
formal note of the remainder. We’ve already missed four hours
and I don’t propose we spend the rest of the day sweating it
out in our radio room. There’s just too much to do. Tell you
what. I’ll do the stint of telling them the latest and then I’ll
say we’re going off the air in view of the new emergency. I
then propose to go and look over Palmyra on your behalf,
sticking to our cover story. And I propose to have a damned
good look at the boathouse and see what those tracks mean.
Right? Then, at five, we’ll rendezvous with the <span class="it">Manta</span> and
prepare to intercept the <span class="it">Disco</span> if and when she sails. As for the
Big Brass in the President’s Special, well they can just play
pinocle in Government House until tomorrow morning.
Tonight’s the night and we just can’t waste it on the “After
you Alphonse” routine. Okay?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond reflected. They were coming in to the outskirts of
Nassau, through the shanty-town slums tucked away behind
the millionaire facade along the waterfront. He had disobeyed
many orders in his life, but this was to disobey the Prime
Minister of England and the President of the United States—a
mighty left and right. But things were moving a damned sight
too fast. M had given him this territory and, right or wrong, M
would back him up, as he always backed up his staff, even if it
meant M’s own head on a charger. Bond said, ‘I agree, Felix.
With the <span class="it">Manta</span> we can manage this on our own. The vital
thing is to find out when those bombs go on board the <span class="it">Disco</span>.
I’ve got an idea for that. May work, may not. It means giving
the Vitali girl a rough time, but I’ll try and handle that side.
Drop me at the hotel and I’ll get cracking. Meet you here again
around four thirty. I’ll call up Harling and see if he’s got anything
new on the <span class="it">Disco</span> and ask him to pass the word upstairs to
you if anything’s cooking. You’ve got all that straight about the
plane? Okay. I’ll hang on to Petacchi’s identification disc for
the time being. Be seeing you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond almost ran through the lobby of the hotel. When he
picked up his key at the reception desk they gave him a telephone
message. He read it going up in the lift. It was from
Domino: ‘Please telephone quickly.’</p>

<p class="pindent">In his room, Bond first ordered a club sandwich and a double
Bourbon on the rocks and then called the Police Commissioner.
The <span class="it">Disco</span> had moved to the oiling wharf at first light and had
filled her tanks. Then she had moved back to her anchorage off
Palmyra. Half an hour ago, at one thirty precisely, the seaplane
had been lowered over the side and, with Largo and one other
on board, had taken off eastwards. When the Commissioner
had heard this on the walkie-talkie from his watchers he had got
on to the control tower at Windsor Field and had asked for the
plane to be radar-tracked. But she had flown low, at about 300
feet, and they had lost her among the islands about fifty miles to
the south-east. Nothing else had come up except that the
harbour authorities had been alerted to expect an American
submarine, the <span class="it">Manta</span>, the nuclear-powered one, at around
five in the evening. That was all. What did Bond know?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said carefully that it was too early to tell. It looked as if
the operation was hotting up. Could the watchers be asked to
rush the news back as soon as the seaplane was sighted coming
back to the <span class="it">Disco</span>? This was vital. Would the Commissioner
please pass on his news to Felix Leiter who was on his way to
the radio room at that moment? And could Bond be lent a car—anything—to
drive himself? Yes, a Land Rover would be fine.
Anything with four wheels.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then Bond got on to Domino out at Palmyra. She sounded
eager for his voice. ‘Where have you been all morning, James?’—it
was the first time she had used his Christian name—‘I want
you to come swimming this afternoon. I have been told to pack
and come on board this evening. Emilio says they are going after
the treasure tonight. Isn’t it nice of him to take me? But it’s a
dead secret, so don’t tell anyone, will you. But he is vague about
when we will be back. He said something about Miami. I
thought—’ she hesitated—‘I thought you might have gone back
to New York by the time we get back. I have seen so little of
you. You left so suddenly last night. What was it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I suddenly got a headache. Touch of the sun I suppose. It
had been quite a day. I didn’t want to go. And I’d love to come
for a swim. Where?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She gave him careful directions. It was a beach a mile further
along the coast from Palmyra. There was a side road and a
thatched hut. He couldn’t miss it. The beach was sort of better
than Palmyra’s. The skin-diving was more fun. And of course
there weren’t so many people. It belonged to some Swedish
millionaire who had gone away. When could he get there? Half
an hour would be all right. They would have more time. On the
reef that is.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s drink came and the sandwich. He sat and consumed
them, looking at the wall, feeling excited about the girl, but
knowing what he was going to do to her life that afternoon. It
was going to be a bad business—when it could have been so
good. He remembered her as he had first seen her, the ridiculous
straw hat tilted down over the nose, the pale blue ribbons
flying as she sped up Bay Street. Oh well . . .</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond rolled his swimming trunks into a towel, put on a dark
blue sea-island cotton shirt over his slacks and slung Leiter’s
Geiger counter over his shoulder. He glanced at himself in the
mirror. He looked like any other tourist with a camera. He felt
in his trousers pocket to make sure he had the identification
bracelet and went out of the room and down in the lift.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Land Rover had Dunlopillo cushions, but the ripple-edged
tarmac and the pitted bends of Nassau’s coastal road
were tough on the springs and the quivering afternoon sun was
a killer. By the time Bond found the sandy track leading off into
the casuarinas and had parked the car on the edge of the beach,
all he wanted to do was get into the sea and stay in it. The
beach hut was a Robinson Crusoe affair of plaited bamboo and
screwpine with a palm thatch whose wide eaves threw black
shadows. Inside were two changing rooms labelled ‘<span class="g">HIS</span>’ and
‘<span class="g">HERS</span>’. Hers contained a small pile of soft clothes and the white
doeskin sandals. Bond changed and walked out again into the
sun. The small beach was a dazzling half-moon of white sand
enclosed on both sides by rocky points. There was no sign of
the girl. The beach shelved quickly through green to blue
under the water. Bond took a few steps through the shallows
and dived through the blood-warm upper water down into
the cool depths. He kept down there as long as possible, feeling
the wonderful cold caress on his skin and through his hair.
Then he surfaced and crawled lazily out to sea, expecting to
see the girl skin-diving round one of the headlands. But there
was no sign of her, and after ten minutes Bond turned back to
the shore, chose a patch of firm sand, and lay down on his
stomach, his face cradled in his arms.</p>

<p class="pindent">Minutes later, something made Bond open his eyes. Coming
towards him across the middle of the quiet bay was a thin trail
of bubbles. When it passed over the dark blue into the green,
Bond could see the yellow single cylinder of the aqualung tank
and the glint of a mask with a fan of dark hair streaming out
behind. The girl beached herself in the shallows. She raised
herself on one elbow and lifted the mask. She said severely,
‘Don’t lie there dreaming. Come and rescue me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got to his feet and walked the few steps to where she
lay. He said, ‘You oughtn’t to aqualung by yourself. What’s
happened? Has a shark been lunching off you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t make silly jokes. I’ve got some sea-egg spines in my
foot. You’ll have to get them out somehow. First of all get this
aqualung off me. It hurts too much to stand on my foot with
all this weight.’ She reached for the buckle at her stomach and
released the catch. ‘Now just lift it off.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond did as he was told and carried the cylinder up into the
shade of the trees. Now she was sitting in the shallow water inspecting
the sole of her right foot. She said. ‘There are only
two of them. They’re going to be difficult.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond came and knelt beside her. The two black spots, close
together, were almost under the curl of the middle toes. He got
up and held out a hand. ‘Come on. We’ll get into the shade.
This is going to take time. Don’t put your foot down or you’ll
push them in further. I’ll carry you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She laughed up at him. ‘My hero! All right. But don’t drop
me.’ She held up both arms. Bond reached down and put one
arm under her knees and another under her armpits. Her arms
closed round his neck. Bond picked her up easily. He stood for
a moment in the lapping water and looked down into her upturned
face. The bright eyes said yes. He bent his head and
kissed her hard on the half-open, waiting mouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">The soft lips held his and drew slowly away. She said rather
breathlessly, ‘You shouldn’t take your reward in advance.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That was only on account.’ Bond closed his hand firmly over
her right breast and walked out of the water and up to the beach
into the shade of the casuarinas. He laid her gently down in the
soft sand. She put her hands behind her head to keep the sand
out of her straggling hair and lay waiting, her eyes half hidden
behind the dark mesh of her eyelashes.</p>

<p class="pindent">The mounded vee of the bikini looked up at Bond and the
proud breasts in the tight cups were two more eyes. Bond felt
his control going. He said roughly, ‘Turn over.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She did as she was told. Bond knelt down and picked up
her right foot. It felt small and soft, like a captured bird, in
his hand. He wiped away the specks of sand and uncurled the
toes. The small pink pads were like the buds of some multiple
flower. Holding them back, he bent and put his lips to where
the broken ends of the black spines showed. He sucked hard
for about a minute. A small piece of grit from one of the spines
came into his mouth and he spat it out. He said. ‘This is going
to be a long business unless I hurt a bit. Otherwise it’ll take
all day and I can’t waste too much time over just one foot.
Ready?’</p>

<p class="pindent">He saw the muscles of her behind clench to take the pain.
She said dreamily, ‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sunk his teeth into the flesh round the spines, bit as
softly as he could and sucked hard. The foot struggled to get
away. Bond paused to spit out some fragments. The marks of
his teeth showed white and there were pinpoints of blood at
the two tiny holes. He licked them away. There was almost no
black left under the skin. He said, ‘This is the first time I’ve
eaten a woman. They’re rather good.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She squirmed impatiently but said nothing.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond knew how much it would be hurting. He said, ‘It’s all
right, Domino. You’re doing fine. Last mouthful.’ He gave
the sole of her foot a reassuring kiss and then, as tenderly as he
could, put his teeth and lips back to work.</p>

<p class="pindent">A minute or two later and he spat out the last section of spine.
He told her it was over and gently laid the foot down. He said,
‘Now you mustn’t get sand into it. Come on, I’ll give you
another lift into the hut and you can put your sandals on.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She rolled over. Her black eyelashes were wet with the tears
of small pain. She wiped a hand over them. She said, looking
seriously up at him, ‘Do you know, you’re the first man who’s
ever made me cry.’ She held up her arms and now there was
complete surrender.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond bent and picked her up. This time he didn’t kiss the
waiting mouth. He carried her to the door of the hut. <span class="g">HIS</span> or
<span class="g">HERS</span>? He carried her into <span class="g">HIS</span>. He reached out a hand for
shirt and shorts and threw them down to make a scrap of a bed.
He put her down softly so that she was standing on his shirt.
She kept her arms round his neck while he undid the single
button of the brassiere and then the tapes of the taut slip. He
stepped out of his bathing trunks and kicked them away.</p>
