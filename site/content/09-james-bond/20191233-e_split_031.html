<h3 class="calibre10">‘<span class="it1">Take it easy, Mr Bond</span>’</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">F</span>elix Leiter</span> came into the white, antiseptic room and
closed the door conspiratorially behind him. He came
and stood beside the bed where Bond lay on the edge of
drugged sleep. ‘How’s it going, feller?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not bad. Just doped.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Doctor said I wasn’t to see you. But I thought you might
care to hear the score. Okay?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sure.’ Bond struggled to concentrate. He didn’t really care.
All he could think about was the girl.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, I’ll make it quick. Doctor’s just doing his rounds and
I’ll get hell if he finds me here. They’ve recovered both bombs,
and Kotze—the physicist chap—is singing like a bird. Seems
<span class="g">SPECTRE</span>’s a bunch of really big-time hoodlums—ex-operators
of <span class="g">SMERSH</span>, the Mafia, the Gestapo—all the big outfits. Headquarters
in Paris. Top man’s called Blofeld, but the bastard
got away—or anyway they haven’t caught up with him yet,
according to <span class="s">CIA</span>. Probably Largo’s radio silence warned him.
Must be quite a Mister Genius. Kotze says <span class="g">SPECTRE</span>’s banked
millions of dollars since they got going five or six years ago.
This job was going to be the final haul. We were right about
Miami. It <span class="it">was</span> going to be Target No 2. Same sort of operation.
They were going to plant the second bomb in the yacht basin.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled weakly. ‘So now everybody’s happy.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh sure. Except me. Haven’t been able to get away from my
damned radio until now. Valves were almost blowing. And
there’s a pile of cipher stuff from M just longing for you to get
around to it. Thank God the top brass from <span class="s">CIA</span> and a team
from your outfit are flying in this evening to take charge. Then
we can hand over and watch our two Governments getting
snarled up over the epilogue—what to tell the public, what to do
with these <span class="g">SPECTRE</span> guys, whether to make you a lord or a
duke, how to persuade me to run for President—tricky little
details like that. And then we’ll damned well get away and have
ourselves a ball some place. Maybe you’d care to take that girl
along? Hell, she’s the one that rates the medals! The guts!
They cottoned on to her Geiger counter. God knows what that
bastard Largo did to her. But she didn’t sing—not a damned
word! Then, when the team was under way, she somehow got
herself out of the cabin porthole, with her gun and aqualung,
and went to get him. Got him, and saved your life into the
bargain! I swear I’ll never call a girl “frail” again—not an
Italian girl anyway.’ Leiter cocked an ear. He moved swiftly
to the door. ‘Hell, there’s that damned medic gumshoeing
down the corridor! Be seeing you, James.’ He quickly turned
the door handle, listened for a moment, and slipped out of the
room.</p>

<p class="pindent">Feebly, desperately, Bond called, ‘Wait! Felix! Felix!’ But
the door had closed. Bond sank back and lay staring at the
ceiling. Slowly anger boiled up inside him—and panic. Why
in hell didn’t someone tell him about the girl? What the hell
did he care about all the rest? Was she all right? Where was
she? Was she . . .</p>

<p class="pindent">The door opened. Bond jerked himself upright. He shouted
furiously at the white-coated figure. ‘The girl. How is she?
Quick! Tell me!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Dr Stengel, the fashionable doctor of Nassau, was not only
fashionable but a good doctor. He was one of the Jewish
refugee doctors who, but for Hitler, would have been looking
after some big hospital in a town the size of Düsseldorf.
Instead, rich and grateful patients had built a modern clinic
for him in Nassau where he treated the natives for shillings
and the millionaires and their wives for ten guineas a visit.
He was more used to handling overdoses of sleeping pills and
the ailments of the rich and old than multiple abrasions,
curare poisoning and odd wounds that looked more as if they
belonged to the days of the pirates. But these were Government
orders, and under the Official Secrets Act at that. Dr
Stengel hadn’t asked any questions about his patients, nor
about the sixteen autopsies he had had to perform, six for
Americans from the big submarine, and ten, including the
corpse of the owner, from the fine yacht that had been in
harbour for so long.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now he said carefully, ‘Miss Vitali will be all right. For the
moment she is suffering from shock. She needs rest.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What else? What was the matter with her?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘She had swum a long way. She was not in a condition to
undertake such a physical strain.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Why not?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor moved towards the door. ‘And now you too must
rest. You have been through much. You will take one of those
hypnotics once every six hours. Yes? And plenty of sleep. You
will soon be on your feet again. But for some time you must
take it easy, Mr Bond.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Take it easy. You must take it easy, Mr Bond. Where had he
heard those idiotic words before? Suddenly Bond was raging
with fury. He lurched out of bed. In spite of the sudden
giddiness, he staggered towards the doctor. He shook a fist
in the urbane face—urbane because the doctor was used to the
emotional storms of patients, and because he knew that in
minutes the strong soporific would put Bond out for hours.
‘Take it easy! God damn you! What do you know about taking
it easy? Tell me what’s the matter with that girl! Where is
she? What’s the number of her room?’ Bond’s hands fell
limply to his sides. He said feebly, ‘For God’s sake tell me,
Doctor. I, I need to know.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Doctor Stengel said patiently, kindly, ‘Someone has ill-treated
her. She is suffering from burns—many burns. She is
still in great pain. But,’ he waved a reassuring hand, ‘inside
she is well. She is in the next room, in No. 4. You may see
her, but only for a minute. Then she will sleep. And so will you.
Yes?’ He held open the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thank you. Thank you, Doctor.’ Bond walked out of the
room with faltering steps. His blasted legs were beginning to
give again. The doctor watched him go to the door of No 4,
watched him open it and close it again behind him with the
exaggerated care of a drunken man. The doctor went off along
the corridor thinking: it won’t do him any harm and it may do
her some good. It is what she needs—some tenderness.</p>

<p class="pindent">Inside the small room, the jalousies threw bands of light and
shadow over the bed. Bond staggered over to the bed and knelt
down beside it. The small head on the pillow turned towards
him. A hand came out and grasped his hair, pulling his head
closer to her. Her voice said huskily, ‘You are to stay here. Do
you understand? You are not to go away.’</p>

<p class="pindent">When Bond didn’t answer, she feebly shook his head to and
fro. ‘Do you hear me, James? Do you understand?’ She felt
Bond’s body slipping to the floor. When she let go his hair, he
slumped down on the rug beside her bed. She carefully shifted
her position and looked down at him. He was already asleep
with his head cradled on the inside of his forearm.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl watched the dark, rather cruel face for a moment.
Then she gave a small sigh, pulled the pillow to the edge of the
bed so that it was just above him, laid her head down so that she
could see him whenever she wanted to, and closed her eyes.</p>
