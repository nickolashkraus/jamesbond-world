<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">B</span>ond</span> <span class="lead-in">shot</span> upwards out of the escape hatch in a blast of
compressed air. Far above him the surface of the sea was
a glittering plate of quicksilver bubbling and swirling with
the small waves that Bond was glad to see had materialized.
The balloon of air rushed on past him and he watched it hit
the silver ceiling like a small bomb. There was a sharp pain in
his ears. To get decompression he fought with his fins and
slowed down until he hung suspended ten feet below the
surface. Below him the long black shape of the <span class="it">Manta</span> looked
sinister and dangerous. He thought of the electric light blazing
inside her and a hundred men going about their business. It
gave him a creepy feeling. Now there came a great explosion
from the escape hatch as if the <span class="it">Manta</span> was firing at Bond
and the black projectile of Leiter shot up at him through the
burst of silver air-bubbles. Bond moved out of his path and
swam on up to the surface. Cautiously he looked above the
small flurry of the waves. The <span class="it">Disco</span>, still blacked out, lay
stopped less than a mile away to his left. There were no signs of
activity on board. A mile to the north lay the long dark outline
of Grand Bahama edged with the white of sand and small
waves. There were small patches of broken white on the coral
and niggerheads in the intervening water. Above the island,
on top of the tall rocket gantries that showed as indistinct
black skeletons, the red aircraft warning lights winked on and
off. Bond got his bearings and quietly jack-knifed his body
down below the surface. He stopped at about ten feet and,
keeping his body pointed like a compass needle along the
course he would have to follow, lay, paddling softly with his
fins to keep position, and waited for the rest of his team.</p>

<p class="line10">★</p>

<p class="pindent">Ten minutes before, Commander Pedersen’s stolid calm had
given way to controlled excitement. ‘By gum, it’s working out
like you said it would!’ he had said wonderingly when Bond
came into the attack centre. ‘They hove to just about ten
minutes ago, and since then the Sonar keeps on picking up
odd noises, underwater noises, just what one would expect if
they were getting things mobilized in that underwater compartment
of theirs. Nothing else to go on, but it’s quite
enough. I guess you and the boys had better get going. As
soon as you’re out of the way, I’m going to float up a surface
antenna and get a signal off to Navy Department, give them a
Sitrep and have the missile station warned to stand by to
evacuate if things go wrong. Then I’m going to come up to
twenty feet or so and have two tubes loaded and keep a
periscope watch. I’m issuing Petty Officer Fallon with a
second flare. I’ve told him to keep out of trouble as much as he
can and be ready to let off the second flare if it looks as if
things are going really bad for our side. Unlikely, but I can’t
take chances with things as they are. If that second flare comes
up, I’m going to close in. Knock a piece or two off the <span class="it">Disco</span>
with the 4-inch and then board her. Then I’m going to be
rough as hell until that bomb’s been recovered and rendered
safe.’ The captain shook his head doubtfully. He ran his hand
over the black iron filings of his crew-cut. ‘This is one hell
of a situation, Commander. We’ll just have to play it by ear.’
He held out his hand. ‘Well. You’d better get going. Good
luck. I hope my boys’ll be a credit to the ship.’</p>

<p class="noindent"> </p>

<p class="pindent">Bond felt a tap on his shoulder. It was Leiter. He grinned
through his mask and jerked up a thumb. Bond took a quick
look behind him. The men lay spread out in a rough wedge,
their fins and hands working slowly as they marked time in the
water. Bond nodded and got going, moving forward with a
slow, even trudge, one hand at his side and the other holding
his spear up the shaft against his chest. Behind him, the black
wedge fanned out into formation and cruised forward like
some giant delta-winged stingray on the prowl.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was hot and sticky inside the black suit and the recirculating
oxygen coming through the mouthpiece tasted of rubber,
but Bond forgot the discomfort as he concentrated on keeping
an even pace and a dead steady course on a prominent niggerhead
with waves washing its head that he had chosen as a fix
for his first contact with the shoal waters.</p>

<p class="pindent">Far below, where the dancing moon shadows could not
penetrate, the bottom was even white sand with an occasional
dark patch that would be seagrass. All around there was
nothing but the great pale luminous hall of the sea at night, a
vast lonely mist through which, against his will and his
intelligence, Bond expected at any moment the dark torpedo of
a great fish to materialize, its eyes and senses questing towards
the rippling shape of the black intruder. But there was nothing,
and nothing came, and gradually the patches of seagrass
became more distinct and ripples showed on the sandy bottom
as it shelved slowly up from fifty to forty and then to thirty
feet.</p>

<p class="pindent">To reassure himself that all was well, Bond took a quick
glance over his shoulder. Yes, they were all there, the oval
panes of eleven gleaming masks with the fluttering fins
kicking up behind them and the glint of the moonlight on the
blades of the spears. Bond thought, By God, if only we can
achieve surprise! What a terrifying ambush to meet coming at
you through the shadows and shapes of the reef! His heart
lifted momentarily at the thought, only to be checked by the
deep gnawing of his hidden fears about the girl. Supposing
she was part of the enemy team! Supposing he came face to face
with her. Would he bring himself to do it—with the spear?
But the whole idea was ridiculous. She was on board, safe. He
would be seeing her again soon, as soon as this work was done.</p>

<p class="pindent">A small coral clump showed up below and refocused his
mind. Now he gazed watchfully ahead. There were more
clumps, the ink splashes of sea eggs, crowds of small glittering
reef fish, a small forest of sea fans that beckoned and waved
with the ebb and flow like the hair of drowned women. Bond
slowed and felt Leiter or Fallon bump into his fins. He made
the slowing signal with his free hand. Now he crept carefully
forward, looking for the silvery wash of the waves against the
top of his navigation mark. Yes, it was there, away to the left.
He was a good twenty feet off course. He swerved towards it,
gave the halt signal and came slowly up under its protection.
With infinite caution he raised his head through the sucking
waves. He glanced first towards the <span class="it">Disco</span>. Yes, she was still
there, showing more plainly with the moon now full on her.
No sign of life. Bond inched his gaze slowly across the intervening
sea. Nothing. A flurry of wavelets down the mirrored
pathway of the moon. Now Bond slid round to the other side
of the coral head. Nothing but the broken waters of the shoal
and, five or six hundred yards away, the clear coastline and the
beach. Bond searched the clear channels for unusual turbulence
in the water, for shapes, for anything moving. What was that?
A hundred yards away, on the edge of a big patch, almost a
lagoon, of clear water amongst the coral, a head, a pale head
with the glitter of a mask across it, had broken the surface for
an instant, taken a quick look round and immediately submerged.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond held his breath. He could feel his thrilled heart
hammering against the inside of his rubber suit. Feeling
stifled, he took the breathing tube from between his teeth and
let his breath burst out of him. He quickly gulped in some
mouthfuls of fresh air, got a good fix on the position, crammed
the tube roughly between his lips and slid back and
down.</p>

<p class="pindent">Behind, the masks gazed blankly at him, waiting for a signal.
Bond jerked up his thumb several times. Through the near
masks he could see the answering flash of teeth. Bond shifted
his grasp on the spear down to an attacking position and surged
forward over the low coral.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now it was only a question of speed and careful navigation
among the occasional higher outcrops. Fish squirted out of his
path and all the reef seemed to waken with the shock-wave of
the twelve hastening bodies. Fifty yards on, Bond signalled
to slow, to fan out in the attacking line. Then he crept on
again, his eyes, aching and bloodshot with the strain, boring
ahead through the jagged shapes amongst the pale mist. Yes!
There was the glitter of white flesh, and there and there. Bond’s
arm made the hurling signal for the attack. He plunged
forward, his spear held in front of him like a lance.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s group came in from the flank. It was a mistake, as
Bond quickly saw, for the <span class="g">SPECTRE</span> team was still moving forward
and at a speed that surprised Bond until he saw the small
whirring propellers on the backs of the enemy. Largo’s men
were wearing compressed air speed-packs, bulky cylinders
strapped between the twin cylinders of their aqualungs, that
operated small screws. Combined with the trudge of the fins,
this gave them at least double normal swimming speed in open
water, but here, amongst the broken coral, and slowed by the
manoeuvring of the sled preceded by the electric Chariot, the
team was perhaps only a knot faster than Bond’s group, now
thrashing their way forward to an interception point that was
rapidly escaping them. And there were the hell of a lot of the
enemy. Bond stopped counting after twelve. And most of them
carried CO2 guns with extra spears in quivers strapped to their
legs. The odds were bad. If only he could get within spear
range before the alarm was given!</p>

<p class="pindent">Thirty yards, twenty. Bond glanced behind him. There
were six of his men almost at arm’s length, the rest straggled
out in a crooked line. Still the masks of Largo’s men pointed
forward. Still they hadn’t seen the black shapes making for
them through the coral. But now, when Bond was level with
Largo’s rearguard, the moon threw his shadow forward across
a pale patch of sand and one man, then another, glanced
quickly round. Bond got a foot against a lump of coral and,
with this to give him impetus, flung himself forward. The
man had no time to defend himself. Bond’s spear caught
him in the side and hurled him against the next man in line.
Bond thrust and wrenched sickeningly. The man dropped his
gun and bent double, clutching his side. Bond bored on into
the mass of naked men now scattering in all directions, with
their jet packs accelerated. Another man went down in front
of him, clawing at his face. A chance thrust of Bond’s had
smashed the glass of his mask. He threshed his way up
towards the surface, kicking Bond in the face as he went. A
spear ripped into the rubber protecting Bond’s stomach and
Bond felt pain and wetness that might be blood or sea-water.
He dodged another flash of metal and a gun butt hit him hard
on the head, but with most of its force spent against the cushion
of water. It knocked him silly and he clung for a moment to a
niggerhead to get his bearings while the black tide of his men
swept past him and individual fights filled the water with black
puffs of blood.</p>

<p class="pindent">The battleground had now shifted to a wide expanse of clear
water fringed with broken coral. On the far side of this, Bond
saw the grounded sled laden with something long and bulky
with a rubber covering, the silver torpedo of the Chariot, and a
close group of men that included the unmistakable, oversize
figure of Largo. Bond melted back among the coral clumps,
got close down to the sand and began to swim cautiously round
the flank of the big clear pool. Almost immediately he had to
stop. A squat figure was cowering in the shadows. His gun
was raised and he was taking careful aim. It was at Leiter, in
difficulties with one of Largo’s men who had him by the
throat while Leiter, the swim fin on his hook gone, clawed
with the hook at the man’s back. Bond gave two hard kicks of
his flippers and hurled his spear from six feet. The light
wood of the handle had no momentum, but the blade cut
into the man’s arm just as the bubbles of gas burst from
the muzzle of the gun. His shot went wide, but he flashed
round and thrust at Bond with the empty gun. Out of the
corner of his eye Bond saw his spear floating slowly up towards
the surface. He dived for the man’s legs in a clumsy rugby
tackle and clawed them off the ground. Then, as the gun
muzzle hit him on the temple, he reached a desperate hand
for the enemy’s mask and ripped it off his face. That was
enough. Bond swam aside and watched the man, blinded by
the salt water, groping his way up towards the surface. Bond
felt a nudge at his arm. It was Leiter, clutching at his oxygen
tube. His face inside the mask was contorted. He made a
feeble gesture upwards. Bond got the message. He seized
Leiter round the waist and leaped for the surface fifteen feet
up. As they broke through the silver ceiling, Leiter tore the
broken tube from his mouth and gulped frantically for air.
Bond held him through the paroxysm and then guided him
to a clump of shallow coral and when Leiter pushed him
angrily away and told him to get the hell back under and leave
him alone, he put up a thumb and dived down again.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now he kept well in the forest of coral and began again his
stalk of Largo. Occasionally he caught glimpses of individual
battles and once he passed under a man, one of his men from
the <span class="it">Manta</span>, staring down at him from the surface. But the face
under the water, framed in its streaming hair, had no mask or
oxygen tube, and the mouth gaped hideously in death. On the
bottom, among the coral clumps, there were bits of wrack
from the tide of battle—an oxygen pack, strips of black rubber,
a complete aqualung and several spears from the CO2 guns.
Bond picked up two of them. Now he was on the edge of the
open lagoon of battle water. The sled, with its obscene rubber
sausage, was still there, guarded by two of Largo’s men with
their guns at the ready. But there was no sign of Largo. Bond
peered into the misty wall through which the moonlight, paler
now, filtered down on to the ripples in the sand, their pretty
patterns scuffed and churned by the feet of the combatants.
Where the sand had been disturbed, reef fish were swarming
to pick up minute fragments of algae and other fodder, like
seagulls and rooks when the plough has passed. There was
nothing else to be seen and there was no way for Bond to
guess how the battle, dispersed into a dozen separate running
fights, was going. What was happening on the surface? When
Bond had taken Leiter up, the sea had been lit by the red flare.
How soon would the rescue dinghy from the <span class="it">Manta</span> be on the
scene? Ought he to stay where he was and watch over the
bomb?</p>

<p class="pindent">With frightening suddenness, the decision was made for
him. Out of the mists to Bond’s right the gleaming torpedo
shape of the electric Chariot shot into the arena. Largo sat
astride it in the saddle. He was bent down behind the small
perspex shield to get extra speed and his left hand held two
of the <span class="it">Manta</span> spears pointing forward while he controlled the
single joystick with his right. As he appeared, the two guards
dropped their guns on the sand and held up the coupling of
the sled. Largo slowed down and drifted up to them. One
man caught the rudder and wrestled to pull the Chariot
backwards towards the couplings. They were going to get out!
Largo was going to take the bomb back out through the reef
and drop it in deep water or bury it! The same thing would
be done with the second bomb in the <span class="it">Disco</span>. With the evidence
gone, Largo would say that he had been ambushed by rival
treasure hunters. How was he to know they came from a
United States submarine? His men had fought back with their
shark guns, but only because they had been attacked first.
Once again the treasure hunt cover would hide everything!</p>

<p class="pindent">The men were still wrestling with the coupling. Largo was
looking back anxiously. Bond measured the distance and flung
himself forward with a great kick against the coral.</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo turned in time to fling up an arm and parry Bond’s
stab with his right-hand spear and Bond’s stab with the left
rattled harmlessly off the aqualung cylinders on Largo’s back.
Bond drove on head first, his hands outstretched for the air
tube in Largo’s mouth. Largo’s hands flashed to protect himself,
dropping his two spears and jerking back the joystick he
had been holding in his right. The Chariot surged forward
away from the two guards and shot obliquely upwards towards
the surface while the two bodies clung and struggled on its
back.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was impossible to fight scientifically. Both men tore
vaguely at each other while their teeth clenched desperately
on the rubber mouthpieces that were their lifelines, but Largo
had a firm grip of the Chariot between his knees while Bond
had to use one hand to hang on to Largo’s equipment to
prevent himself being thrown. Again and again Largo’s elbow
crashed into Bond’s face while Bond dodged from side to side
to take the blows on the mouth and not on the precious glass
of his mask. At the same time Bond hammered with his free
hand at his only target, Largo’s kidneys, beneath the brown
square of flesh that was all he could reach.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Chariot broke surface fifty yards down the wide
channel leading to the open sea and tore crazily on, its nose,
tilted by Bond’s weight over the tail, sticking at forty-five
degrees out of the water. Now Bond was half in the wash and
it would only be minutes before Largo managed to twist and
get both hands to him. Bond made up his mind. He let go of
Largo’s aqualung and, clutching the stern of the torpedo
between his legs, slid back until he felt the top of the rudder at
his back. Now, if he could avoid the screw! He reached one
hand down between his legs, got a firm grip of the rudder,
and heaved himself backwards and off the machine. Now his
face, inches away from the whirring propeller, was buffeted
by the turbulence, but he dragged hard downwards and felt
the stern coming with him. Soon the damned thing would be
almost upright. Bond wrenched the blade of the rudder
sideways in a right-angled turn and then, his arms almost
torn out of their sockets by the strain, let go. Above and in
front of him, as the torpedo veered right-handed, Largo’s
body, thrown by the sharp turn and the change of balance,
crashed into the water, twisted quickly over and faced downwards,
the mask searching for Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was beat, utterly defeated by exhaustion. Now there
was nothing for him but to get away and somehow stay alive.
The bomb was immobilized, the Chariot gone, careering in
circles over the sea. Largo was finished. Bond summoned the
remains of his strength and sluggishly dived down towards
his last hope, a refuge among the coral.</p>

<p class="pindent">Almost lazily, Largo, his strength unimpaired, came down
after him, swimming in a giant, easy crawl. Bond swerved in
among the coral heads. A white sand passage showed up and
he followed it, then there was a fork. Bond, trusting to the small
extra protection of his rubber suit, followed the narrower lane
between the sharp clumps. But now a black shadow was above
him, following him. Largo had not bothered to get into the
channel. He was swimming above the coral, looking down,
watching Bond, biding his time. Bond looked up. There was a
gleam of teeth round the mouthpiece. Largo knew he had got
him. Bond flexed his fingers to get more life into them. How
could he hope to defeat those great hands, those hands that
were machine-tools?</p>

<p class="pindent">And now the narrow passage was widening. There was the
glint of a sandy channel ahead. There was no room for Bond to
turn round. He could only swim on into the open trap. Bond
stopped and stood. It was the only thing to do. Largo had him
like a rat in a trap. But at least Largo would have to come in
and get him. Bond looked upwards. Yes, the great gleaming
body, followed by its string of silver bubbles, was forging
carefully on into the open water. Now, swiftly, like a pale seal,
he dived down to the firm sand and stood facing Bond. Slowly
he advanced between the walls of coral, the big hands held
forward for the first hold. At ten paces he stopped. His eyes
swivelled sideways to a coral clump. His right hand shot out
at something and gave a quick yank. When the hand pulled
back, it was writhing, writhing with eight more fingers. Largo
held the baby octopus in front of him like a small, waving
flower. His teeth drew away from the rubber mouthpiece and
the clefts of a smile appeared in his cheeks. He put up one
hand and significantly tapped his mask. Bond bent down and
picked up a rock covered with seaweed. Largo was being
melodramatic. A rock in Largo’s mask would be more efficient
than having an octopus slapped across his. Bond wasn’t
worried by the octopus. Only a day before he had been in
company with a hundred of them. It was Largo’s longer reach
that worried him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo took a pace forward and then another. Bond crouched,
backing carefully, so as not to cut his rubber skin, into the
narrow passage. Largo came on, slowly, deliberately. In two
more paces he would attack.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond caught a glint of movement out in the open behind
Largo. Someone to the rescue? But the glint was white, not
black. It was one of theirs!</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo leaped forward.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond kicked off the coral and dived down for Largo’s groin,
the jagged rock in his hand. But Largo was ready. His knee
came up hard against Bond’s head and at the same time his
right hand came swiftly down and clamped the small octopus
across Bond’s mask. Then from above, both his hands came
down and got Bond by the neck, lifted him up like a child and
held him at arm’s length, pressing.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond could see nothing. Vaguely he felt the slimy tentacles
groping over his face, getting a grip of the mouthpiece between
his teeth, pulling. But the blood was roaring in his head and
he knew he was gone.</p>

<p class="pindent">Slowly he sank to his knees. But how, why was he sinking?
What had happened to the hands at his throat? His eyes,
squeezed tight in agony, opened and there was light. The
octopus, now at his chest, let go and shot away among the
coral. In front of him Largo, Largo with a spear sticking
horribly through his neck, lay kicking feebly on the sand.
Behind him and looking down at the body, stood a small, pale
figure fitting another spear into an underwater gun. The long
hair flowed round her head like a veil in the luminous sea.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got slowly to his feet. He took a step forward. Suddenly
he felt his knees beginning to give. A wave of blackness began
to creep up over his vision. He leant against the coral, his
mouth slackening round the oxygen tube. Water seeped into
his mouth. No! he said to himself. No! Don’t let that happen!</p>

<p class="pindent">A hand took one of his. But Domino’s eyes behind her
mask were somewhere else. They were blank, lost. She was
ill! What was the matter with her? Bond was suddenly awake
again. His eyes took in the blood patches on her bathing dress,
the angry red marks on her body between the scraps of bikini.
They would both die, standing there, unless he did something
about it. Slowly his leaden legs began to stir the black fins.
They were moving up. It wasn’t so difficult after all. And now,
vaguely, her own fins were helping.</p>

<p class="pindent">The two bodies reached the surface together and lay, face
downwards, in the shallow troughs of the waves.</p>

<p class="pindent">The oyster light of dawn slowly turned pink. It was going to
be a beautiful day.</p>
