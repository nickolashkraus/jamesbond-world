<p class="pindent">There was a moment’s silence in the room during which
Bond reflected how odd it was that suspicions should have
fallen so suddenly and so unanimously on one man. And did
that automatically clear all the others? Might not Krebs be
the inside man of a gang? Or was he working on his own and,
if so, with what object? And what did his snooping have
to do with the death of Tallon and Bartsch?</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax broke the silence. “Well, that seems to settle it,” he
said, looking to Bond for confirmation. Bond gave a non-committal
nod. “Just have to leave him to you. At all events,
we must see he is kept well away from the site. As a matter
of fact I shall be taking him to London tomorrow. Last-minute
details to be settled with the Ministry and Walter
can’t be spared. Krebs is the only man I’ve got who can do
the work of an ADC. That’ll keep him out of trouble. We’ll
all have to keep an eye on him until then. Unless of course
you want to put him under lock and key straight away. I’d
prefer not,” he said candidly. “Don’t want to upset the team
any more.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It shouldn’t be necessary,” said Bond. “Has he got any
particular friends among the other men?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Never seen him speak to any of them except Walter and
the household,” said Drax. “Daresay he considers himself a
cut above the others. Personally, I don’t believe there’s much
harm in the chap or I wouldn’t have kept him. He’s left alone
in that house all day long and I expect he’s one of those
people who like playing the detective and prying into other
people’s affairs. What do you say? Perhaps we could leave it
like that?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond nodded, keeping his thoughts to himself.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, then,” said Drax, obviously glad to leave a distasteful
subject and get back to business, “we’ve got other things
to talk about. Two more days to go and I’d better tell you
the programme.” He got up from his chair and paced heavily
up and down the room behind his desk. “Today is Wednesday,”
he said. “At one o’clock the site will be closed for fuelling.
This will be supervised by Dr Walter and myself and
two men from the Ministry. Just in case anything goes wrong
a television camera will record everything we do. Then, if
there is an explosion, our successors will know better next
time,” he barked a short laugh. “Weather permitting, the
roof will be opened tonight to allow the fumes to clear. My
men will stand guard in watches at ten-yard intervals a hundred
yards from the site. There will be three armed men on
the beach opposite the exhaust hole in the cliff. Tomorrow
morning the site will be opened again until midday for a final
check and from that moment, except for the gyro settings,
the Moonraker will be ready to go. The guards will be
permanently on duty round the site. On Friday morning I
shall personally supervise the gyro settings. The men from
the Ministry will take over the firing point and the RAF will
man the radar. The BBC will set up their vans behind the
firing point and will begin their running commentary at
eleven-forty-five. At midday exactly I shall press the plunger,
a radio beam will break an electric circuit and,” he smiled
broadly, “we shall see what we shall see.” He paused, fingering
his chin. “Now what else? Well now. Shipping will be
cleared from the target area from midnight on Thursday. The
Navy will provide a patrol of the boundaries of the area all
through the morning. There will be a BBC commentator in
one of the ships. The Ministry of Supply experts will be in
a salvage ship with deep-sea television and after the rocket
has landed they will try to bring up the remains. You may be
interested to know,” continued Drax, rubbing his hands with
almost childish pleasure, “that a messenger from the Prime
Minister has brought me the very welcome news that not only
will there be a special Cabinet Meeting to listen to the broadcast,
but the Palace will also be listening in to the launching.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Splendid,” said Bond, pleased for the man’s sake.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thank you,” said Drax. “Now I want to be quite certain
that you are satisfied with my security arrangements on the
site itself. I don’t think we need worry about what goes on
outside. The RAF and the police seem to be doing a very
thorough job.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Everything seems to have been taken care of,” said Bond.
“There doesn’t seem to be very much for me to do in the time
that’s left.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Nothing that I can think of,” agreed Drax, “except our
friend Krebs. This afternoon he will be in the television van
taking notes, so he will be out of trouble. Why don’t you have
a look at the beach and the bottom of the cliff while he’s out
of action? That’s the only weak spot I can think of. I’ve often
thought that if someone wanted to get into the site he would
try the exhaust pit. Take Miss Brand with you. Two pairs of
eyes, and so forth, and she won’t be able to use her office until
tomorrow morning.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Good,” said Bond. “I’d certainly like to have a look at
the seaward side after lunch, and if Miss Brand’s got nothing
better to do . . .” He turned towards her with his eyebrows
raised.</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala Brand looked down her nose. “Certainly, if Sir Hugo
wishes,” she said without enthusiasm.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax rubbed his hands together. “Then that’s settled,” he
said. “And now I must get down to work. Miss Brand, would
you ask Dr Walter to come along if he’s free. See you at
lunch,” he said to Bond, on a note of dismissal.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond nodded. “I think I’ll walk over and have a look at
the firing point,” he said, not quite knowing why he lied.
He turned and followed Gala Brand out through the double
doors into the base of the shaft.</p>

<p class="pindent">A huge black snake of rubber piping meandered over the
shining steel floor and Bond watched the girl pick her way
among its coils to where Walter was standing alone. He was
gazing up at the mouth of the fuel pipe being hoist to where
a gantry, outstretched to the threshold of an access door halfway
up the rocket, indicated the main fuel tanks.</p>

<p class="pindent">She said something to Walter and then stood beside him
looking upwards as the pipe was delicately manhandled
through into the interior of the rocket.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond thought she looked very innocent standing there
with her brown hair falling back from her head and the curve
of her ivory throat sweeping down into the plain white shirt.
With her hands clasped behind her back, gazing raptly upwards
at the glittering fifty feet of the Moonraker, she might
have been a schoolgirl looking up at a Christmas tree—except
for the impudent pride of the jutting breasts, swept
up by the thrown-back head and shoulders.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled to himself as he walked to the foot of the iron
stairway and started to climb. That innocent, desirable girl,
he reminded himself, is an extremely efficient policewoman.
She knows how to kick, and where; she can break my arm
probably more easily and quickly than I can break hers, and
at least half of her belongs to the Special Branch of Scotland
Yard. Of course, he reflected, looking down just in time to see
her follow Dr Walters into Drax’s office, there is always the
other half.</p>

<p class="pindent">Outside, the brilliant May sunshine seemed particularly
golden after the blue-white of the arcs and Bond could feel
it hot on his back as he walked purposefully across the concrete
towards the house. The foghorn from the Goodwins was
silent and the morning was so quiet that he could hear the
rhythmic thump of a ship’s engines as a coaster negotiated
the Inner Leads, between the Goodwins and the shore, on its
way northwards.</p>

<p class="pindent">He approached the house under cover of the wide blast-wall
and then quickly crossed the few yards to the front door,
the crepe rubber soles of his shoes making no noise. He eased
open the door and left it ajar and walked softly into the hall
and stood listening. There was the early summer noise of a
bumble-bee fussing against the pane of one of the windows
and a distant clatter from the barracks behind the house.
Otherwise the silence was deep and warm and reassuring.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked carefully across the hall and up the stairs,
placing his feet flat on the ground and using the extreme
edges of the steps where the boards would be less likely to
creak. There was no noise in the corridor but Bond saw that
his door at the far end was open. He took his gun from under
his armpit and walked swiftly down the carpeted passage.</p>

<p class="pindent">Krebs had his back to him. He was kneeling forward in
the middle of the floor with his elbows on the ground. His
hands were at the wheels of the combination lock of Bond’s
leather case. His whole attention was focused on the click of
the tumblers in the lock.</p>

<p class="pindent">The target was tempting and Bond didn’t hesitate. His
teeth showed in a hard smile, he took two quick paces into
the room and his foot lashed out.</p>

<p class="pindent">All his force was behind the point of his shoe and his
balance and timing were perfect.</p>

<p class="pindent">The scream of a jay was driven out of Krebs as, like the
caricature of a leaping frog, he hurtled over Bond’s case,
across a yard or so of carpet, and into the front of the
mahogany dressing-table. His head hit the middle of it so
hard that the heavy piece of furniture rocked on its base.
The scream was abruptly cut off and he crashed in an inert
spreadeagle on the floor and lay still.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stood looking at him and listening for the sound of
hurrying footsteps, but there was still silence in the house.
He walked over to the sprawling figure and bent down and
heaved it over on its back. The face around the smudge of
yellow moustache was pale and some blood had oozed down
over the forehead from a cut in the top of the skull. The eyes
were closed and the breathing was laboured.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond knelt down on one knee and went carefully through
every pocket of Krebs’s neat grey pinstripe suit, laying the
disappointingly meagre contents on the carpet beside the
body. There was no pocketbook and no papers. The only
objects of interest were a bunch of skeleton keys, a spring
knife with a well-sharpened stiletto blade, and an obscene
little truss-shaped black leather cosh. Bond pocketed these
and then went to his bedside table and fetched the untouched
bottle of Vichy water.</p>

<p class="pindent">It took five minutes to revive Krebs and get him into a
sitting position with his back to the dressing-table and another
five for him to be capable of speaking. Gradually the
colour came back to his face and the craftiness to his eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I answer no questions except to Sir Hugo,” he said as
Bond started the interrogation. “You have no right to
question me. I was doing my duty.” His voice was surly and
assured.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took the empty Vichy bottle by the neck. “Think
again,” he said. “Or I’ll beat the daylight out of you until
this breaks and then use the neck for some plastic surgery.
Who told you to go over my room?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“<span class="it">Leck mich am Arsch.</span>” Krebs spat the obscene insult at
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond bent down and cracked him sharply across the shins.</p>

<p class="pindent">Krebs’s body cringed, but, as Bond raised his arm again,
he suddenly shot up from the floor and dived under the
descending bottle. The blow caught him hard on the shoulder,
but it didn’t check his momentum and he was out of the
door and halfway down the corridor before Bond started in
pursuit.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stopped outside the door and watched the flying
figure swerve down the stairs and out of sight. Then, as he
heard the scurrying squeak of the rubber-soled shoes as they
fled down the stairs and across the hall, he laughed abruptly
to himself and went back into his room and locked the door.
Short of beating the man’s brains out it hadn’t looked as if he
would get much out of Krebs. He had given him something
to think about. Crafty little brute. His injuries couldn’t have
been so bad after all. Well, it would be up to Drax to punish
him. Unless, of course, Krebs had been carrying out Drax’s
orders.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond cleaned up the mess in his room and sat down on
his bed and gazed at the opposite wall with unseeing eyes.
It had not been only instinct that had made him tell Drax
he was going to the firing point instead of to the house.
It had seriously crossed his mind that the snooping of Krebs
was on Drax’s orders, and that Drax ran his own security
system. And yet how did that tally with the deaths of Tallon
and Bartsch? Or had the double killing been a coincidence
unrelated to the marks on the chart and the fingerprints of
Krebs?</p>

<p class="pindent">As if summoned by his thoughts, there came a knock on
the door and the butler came in. He was followed by a police
sergeant in road patrol uniform who saluted and handed
Bond a telegram. Bond took it over to the window. It was
signed Baxter, which meant Vallance, and it read:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="pindent"><span class="sc">FIRSTLY CALL WAS FROM HOUSE SECONDLY FOG REQUIRED
OPERATION OF FOGHORN SO SHIP HEARD COMMA OBSERVED
NOTHING THIRDLY YOUR COMPASS RECKONING TOO NEAR
SHORE THUS OUT OF SIGHT OF SAINT MARGARETS OR DEAL
COASTGUARD ENDS.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="pindent">“Thank you,” said Bond. “No answer.”</p>

<p class="pindent">When the door was closed Bond put his lighter to the
telegram and dropped it in the fireplace, scuffing the charred
remains into powder with the sole of his shoe.</p>

<p class="pindent">Nothing much there except that Tallon’s call to the Ministry
might indeed have been heard by someone in the house,
which might have resulted in the search of his room, which
might have resulted in his death. But what about Bartsch?
If all this was part of something much bigger how could it be
linked up with an attempt to sabotage the rocket? Wasn’t it
much simpler to conclude that Krebs was a natural snooper,
or more likely that he was operating for Drax, who seemed
to be meticulously security-conscious and who might want
to be sure of the loyalty of his secretary, of Tallon, and certainly,
after their encounter at Blades, of Bond? Wasn’t it
just acting like the chief (and Bond had known many of them
who would fit the picture) of some super-secret project during
the war who had reinforced official security with his own
private spy system?</p>

<p class="pindent">If that theory was correct there only remained the double
killing. Now that Bond had caught the magic and the tension
of the Moonraker the facts of the hysterical shooting seemed
more reasonable. As for the mark on the chart, that might
have been made any day in the past year; the night-glasses
were just night-glasses and the moustaches on the men were
just a lot of moustaches.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat on in the silent room, shifting the pieces in the
jigsaw so that two entirely different pictures alternated in his
mind. In one the sun shone and all was clear and innocent as
the day. The other was a dark confusion of guilty motives,
obscure suspicions, and nightmare queries.</p>

<p class="pindent">When the gong sounded for lunch he still did not know
which picture to choose. To shelve a decision he cleared his
mind of everything but the prospect of his afternoon alone
with Gala Brand.</p>
