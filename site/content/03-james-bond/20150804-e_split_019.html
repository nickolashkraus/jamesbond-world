<p class="pindent">When the paroxysm was over he felt Gala’s hand in his
hair. He looked round and saw her wince at the sight of
him. She tugged at his hair and pointed up the cliffs. As
she did so a shower of small pieces of chalk rattled down
beside them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Weakly he got to his knees and then to his feet and together
they scrambled and slid down off the mountain of
chalk and away from the crater against the cliff from which
they had escaped.</p>

<p class="pindent">The harsh sand under their feet was like velvet. They both
collapsed full length and lay clutching at it with their horrible
white hands as if its rough gold would wash the filthy whiteness
away. Then Gala too was mercifully sick and Bond
crawled a few paces away to leave her alone. He hauled himself
to his feet against a single lump of chalk as big as a small
motor-car, and at last his bloodshot eyes took in the hell that
had almost engulfed them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Down to the beginning of the rocks, now lapped by the
incoming tide, sprawled the debris of the cliff face, an avalanche
of chalk blocks and shapes. The white dust of its
collapse covered nearly an acre. Above it a jagged rent had
appeared in the cliff and a wedge of blue sky had been bitten
out of the distant top where before the line of the horizon
had been almost straight. There were no longer any seabirds
near them and Bond guessed that the smell of disaster would
keep them away from the place for days.</p>

<p class="pindent">The nearness of their bodies to the cliff was what had saved
them, that and the slight protection of the overhang below
which the sea had bitten into the base of the cliff. They had
been buried by the deluge of smaller stuff. The heavier
chunks, any one of which would have crushed them, had
fallen outwards, the nearest missing them by a few feet. And
their nearness to the cliff was the reason for Bond’s right arm
having been comparatively free so that they had been able to
burrow out of the mound before they were stifled. Bond
realized that if some reflex had not hurled him on top of Gala
at the moment of the avalanche they would now both be
dead.</p>

<p class="pindent">He felt her hand on his shoulder. Without looking at her
he put his arm round her waist and together they got down
to the blessed sea and let their bodies fall weakly, thankfully
into the shallows.</p>

<p class="pindent">Ten minutes later it was two comparatively human beings
who walked back up the sand to the rocks where their clothes
lay, a few yards away from the cliff-fall. They were both completely
naked. The rags of their underclothing lay somewhere
under the pile of chalk dust, torn off in their struggle to
escape. But, like survivors from a ship-wreck, their nakedness
meant nothing. Washed clean of the cloying gritty chalk
dust and with their hair and mouths scoured with the salt
water, they felt weak and bedraggled, but by the time they
had got their clothes on and had shared Gala’s comb there
was little to show what they had been through.</p>

<p class="pindent">They sat with their backs to a rock and Bond lit a first
delicious cigarette, drinking the smoke deeply into his lungs
and expelling it slowly through his nostrils. When Gala had
done the best she could with her powder and lipstick he lit a
cigarette for her and, as he handed it to her, for the first time
they looked into each other’s eyes and smiled. Then they sat
and looked silently out to sea, at the golden panorama that
was the same and yet entirely new.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond broke the silence.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, by God,” he said. “That was close.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I still don’t know what happened,” said Gala. “Except
that you saved my life.” She put her hand on his and then
took it away.</p>

<p class="pindent">“If you hadn’t been there I should be dead,” said Bond.
“If I’d stayed where I was—” He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he turned and looked at her. “I suppose you realize,”
he said flatly, “that someone pushed the cliff down on us?”
She looked back at him with wide eyes. “If we searched
around in all that,” he gestured towards the avalanche of
chalk, “we would find the marks of two or three drill-holes
and traces of dynamite. I saw the smoke and I heard the bang
of the explosion a split second before the cliff came down.
And so did the gulls,” he added.</p>

<p class="pindent">“And what’s more,” continued Bond after a pause, “it
can’t have been only Krebs. It was done in full view of the
site. And it was done by several people, well organized, with
spies on us from the moment we went down the cliff path to
the beach.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was comprehension in Gala’s eyes and a flash of
fear. “What are we to do?” she asked anxiously. “What’s it
all about?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“They want us dead,” said Bond calmly. “So we have to
stay alive. As to what it’s all about, we’ll just have to find
that out.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You see,” he went on, “I’m afraid even Vallance isn’t
going to be much help. When they made up their minds we
were properly buried, they’ll have got away from the top of
the cliff as fast as they could. They’d know that even if someone
saw the cliff-fall, or heard it, they wouldn’t get very
excited. There are twenty miles of these cliffs and not many
people come here until the summer. If the coastguards heard
it they may have made a note in the log. But in the spring I
expect they get plenty of falls. The winter frosts thaw out in
cracks that may be hundreds of years old. So our friends
would wait until we didn’t turn up tonight and then get the
police and coastguards to search for us. They’d keep quiet
until the high tide had made porridge out of a good deal of
this.” He gestured towards the shambles of fallen chalk. “The
whole scheme is admirable. And even if Vallance believes
us, there’s not enough evidence to make the Prime Minister
interfere with the Moonraker. The damn thing’s so infernally
important. All the world’s waiting to see if it’ll work or
not. And anyway, what’s our story? What the hell’s it all
about? Some of those bloody Germans up there seem to want
us dead before Friday. But what for?” He paused. “It’s up to
us, Gala. It’s a lousy business but we’ve simply got to solve
it ourselves.”</p>

<p class="pindent">He looked into her eyes. “What about it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala laughed abruptly. “Don’t be ridiculous,” she said.
“It’s what we’re paid for. Of course we’ll take them on. And
I agree we’d get nowhere with London. We’d look absolutely
ridiculous telephoning reports about cliffs falling on our
heads. What are we doing down here anyway, fooling around
without any clothes on instead of getting on with our jobs?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond grinned. “We only lay down for ten minutes to get
dry,” he protested mildly. “How do you think we ought to
have spent the afternoon? Taking everybody’s fingerprints
all over again? That’s about all you police think about.” He
felt ashamed when he saw her stiffen. He held his hand up.
“I didn’t really mean that,” he said. “But can’t you see what
we’ve done this afternoon? Just what had to be done. We’ve
made the enemy show his hand. Now we’ve got to take the
next step and find out who the enemy is and why he wanted
us out of the way. And then if we’ve got enough evidence
that someone’s trying to sabotage the Moonraker we’ll have
the whole place turned inside out, the practice shoot postponed,
and to hell with politics.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She jumped to her feet. “Oh, of course you’re right,” she
said impatiently. “It’s just that I want to do something about
it in a hurry.” She looked for a moment out to sea, away
from Bond. “You’ve only just come into the picture. I’ve
been living with this rocket for more than a year and I can’t
bear the idea that something may happen to it. So much
seems to depend on it. For all of us. I want to get back there
quickly and to find out who wanted to kill us. It may be
nothing to do with the Moonraker, but I want to make sure.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stood up, showing nothing of the pain from the cuts
and bruises on his back and legs. “Come on,” he said, “it’s
nearly six o’clock. The tide’s coming in fast but we can get to
St Margaret’s before it catches us. We’ll clean up at the
Granville there and have a drink and some food and then
we’ll go back to the house in the middle of dinner. I shall
be interested to see what sort of a reception we get. After that
we’ll have to concentrate on staying alive and seeing what
we can see. Can you make it to St Margaret’s?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’t be silly,” said Gala. “Policewomen aren’t made of
gossamer.” She gave a reluctant smile at Bond’s ironically
respectful ‘Of course not’, and they turned towards the
distant tower of the South Foreland lighthouse and set off
through the shingle.</p>

<p class="pindent">At half-past eight the taxi from St Margaret’s dropped
them at the second guard gate and they showed their passes
and walked quietly up through the trees on to the expanse of
concrete. They both felt keyed up and in high spirits. A hot
bath and an hour’s rest at the accommodating Granville had
been followed by two stiff brandies-and-sodas for Gala and
three for Bond followed by delicious fried soles and Welsh
rarebits and coffee. And now, as they confidently approached
the house, it would have needed second sight to tell that they
were both dead tired and that they were naked and bruised
under their walking clothes.</p>

<p class="pindent">They let themselves quietly in through the front door and
stood for a moment in the lighted hall. A cheerful mumble of
voices came from the dining-room. There was a pause
followed by a burst of laughter which was dominated by the
harsh bark of Sir Hugo Drax.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s mouth twisted wryly as he led the way across the
hall to the door of the dining-room. Then he fixed a cheerful
smile on his face and opened the door for Gala to pass
through.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax sat at the head of the table, festive in his plum-coloured
smoking-jacket. A forkful of food, halfway to his
open mouth, had stopped in mid-air as they appeared in the
doorway. Unnoticed, the food slid off the fork and fell with
a soft, distinct ‘plep’ on to the edge of the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">Krebs had been in the act of drinking a glass of red wine
and the glass, frozen against his mouth, poured a thin trickle
down his chin and thence on to his brown satin tie and yellow
shirt.</p>

<p class="pindent">Dr Walter had had his back to the door and it was not
until he observed the unusual behaviour of the others, the
bulging eyes, the gape of the mouths, and the blood-drained
faces, that he whipped his head round towards the door. His
reactions, thought Bond, were slower than the others, or else
his nerves were steadier. “<span class="it">Ach so</span>,” he said softly. “<span class="it">Die
Engländer.</span>”</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax was on his feet. “My dear chap,” he said thickly.
“My dear chap. We were really very worried. Just wondering
whether to send out a search party. Few minutes ago one
of the guards came in and reported there seemed to have
been a cliff-fall.” He came round towards them, his napkin
in one hand and the fork still erect in the other.</p>

<p class="pindent">With the movement the blood surged back into his face,
which became first mottled and then its usual red. “You really
might have let me know,” he spoke to the girl, anger rising
in his voice. “Most extraordinary behaviour.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It was my fault,” said Bond, moving forward into the
room so that he could keep them all in view. “The walk was
longer than I expected. I thought we might get caught by the
tide so we went on to St Margaret’s and had something to eat
there and took a taxi. Miss Brand wanted to telephone but I
thought we would be back before eight. You must put the
blame on me. But please go ahead with your dinner. Perhaps
I might join you for coffee and dessert. I expect Miss Brand
would prefer to go to her room. She must be tired after her
long day.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked deliberately round the table and took the
chair next to Krebs. Those pale eyes, he noticed, after the
first shock, had been fixed firmly on his plate. As Bond came
up behind him he was delighted to see a large mound of
Elastoplast on the crown of Krebs’s head.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, go to bed, Miss Brand, I will talk to you in the morning,”
said Drax testily. Gala obediently left the room and
Drax went to his chair and sat heavily down.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Most remarkable those cliffs,” said Bond blithely. “Quite
awe-inspiring walking along wondering if they’re going to
choose just that moment to collapse on one. Reminded me of
Russian roulette. And yet one never reads of people being
killed by cliffs falling on them. The odds against getting hurt
must be terrific.” He paused. “By the way, what was that you
were saying about a cliff-fall just now?”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a faint groan on Bond’s right, followed by a
crash of glass and china as Krebs’s head fell forward on to
the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked at him with polite curiosity.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Walter,” said Drax sharply. “Can’t you see that Krebs
is ill? Take the man out and put him to bed. And don’t be
too soft with him. The man drinks too much. Hurry up.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Walter, his face crumpled and angry, strode round the
table and jerked Krebs’s head out of the debris. He took him
by his coat collar and hauled him to his feet and away from
his chair.</p>

<p class="pindent">“<span class="it">Du Scheisskerl,</span>” hissed Walter at the mottled, vacant
face. “<span class="it">Marsch!</span>” He turned him round and hustled him to
the swing door into the pantry and rammed him through.
There were muffled sounds of stumbling and cursing and then
a door banged and there was silence.</p>

<p class="pindent">“He must have had a heavy day,” said Bond looking at
Drax.</p>

<p class="pindent">The big man was sweating freely. He wiped his face with
a circular sweep of his napkin. “Nonsense,” he said shortly.
“He drinks.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The butler, erect and unperturbed by the apparition of
Krebs and Walter in his pantry, brought in the coffee. Bond
took some and sipped it. He waited for the pantry door to
close again. Another German, he thought. He’ll already have
passed the news back to the barracks. Or perhaps all the team
weren’t involved. Perhaps there was a team within a team.
And if so, did Drax know about it? His behaviour when Bond
and Gala had come through the door had been inconclusive.
Had part of his astonishment been affronted dignity, the
shock of a vain man whose programme had been upset by a
chit of a secretary? He had certainly covered up well. And all
the afternoon he had been down the shaft supervising the
fuelling. Bond decided to probe a little.</p>

<p class="pindent">“How did the fuelling go?” he asked, his eyes fixed on the
other man.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax was lighting a long cigar. He glanced up at Bond
through the smoke and the flame of his match.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Excellently.” He puffed at the cigar to get it going.
“Everything is ready now. The guards are out. An hour or
two clearing up down there in the morning and then the site
will be closed. By the way,” he added. “I shall be taking Miss
Brand up to London in the car tomorrow afternoon. I shall
need a secretary as well as Krebs. Have you got any plans?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I have to go to London too,” said Bond on an impulse.
“I have my final report to make to the Ministry.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, really?” said Drax casually. “What about? I thought
you were satisfied with the arrangements.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes,” said Bond non-committally.</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s all right then,” said Drax breezily. “And now if
you don’t mind,” he got up from the table, “I’ve got some
papers waiting for me in my study. So I’ll say good-night.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Good-night,” said Bond to the already retreating back.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond finished his coffee and went out into the hall and
up to his bedroom. It was obvious that it had been searched
again. He shrugged his shoulders. There was only the leather
case. Its contents would show nothing except that he had
come equipped with the tools of his trade.</p>

<p class="pindent">His Beretta in its shoulder-holster was still where he had
hidden it, in the empty leather case that belonged to Tallon’s
night-glasses. He took the gun out and slipped it under his
pillow.</p>

<p class="pindent">He took a hot bath and used half a bottle of iodine on the
cuts and bruises he could reach. Then he got into bed and
turned out the light. His body hurt and he was exhausted.</p>

<p class="pindent">For a moment he thought of Gala. He had told her to take
a sleeping pill and lock her door, but otherwise not to worry
about anything until the morning.</p>

<p class="pindent">Before he emptied his mind for sleep he wondered uneasily
about her trip with Drax the next day to London.</p>

<p class="pindent">Uneasily, but not desperately. In due course many questions
would have to be answered and many mysteries probed,
but the basic facts seemed solid and unanswerable. This
extraordinary millionaire had built this great weapon. The
Ministry of Supply were pleased with it and considered it
sound. The Prime Minister and Parliament thought so too.
The rocket was to be fired in less than thirty-six hours under
full supervision and the security arrangements were as strict
as they could possibly be. Somebody, and probably several
people, wanted him and the girl out of the way. Nerves were
stretched down here. There was a lot of tension about. Perhaps
there was jealousy. Perhaps some people actually suspected
them of being saboteurs. But what would that matter
so long as he and Gala kept their eyes open? Not much more
than a day to go. They were right out in the open here, in
May, in England, in peacetime. It was crazy to worry about
a few lunatics so long as the Moonraker was out of danger.</p>

<p class="pindent">And as for tomorrow, reflected Bond as sleep reached out
for him, he would arrange to meet Gala in London and bring
her back with him. Or she could even stay up in London for
the night. Either way he would look after her until the
Moonraker was safely fired and then, before work began on
the Mark II weapon, there would have to be a very thorough
clean-up indeed.</p>

<p class="pindent">But these were treacherously comforting thoughts. There
was danger about and Bond knew it.</p>

<p class="pindent">He finally drifted into sleep with one small scene firmly
fixed in his mind.</p>

<p class="pindent">There had been something very disquieting about the
dinner-table downstairs. It had been laid for only three
people.</p>
