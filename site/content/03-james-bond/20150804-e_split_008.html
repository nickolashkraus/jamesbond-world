<p class="pindent">Drax and Meyer were waiting for them. They were leaning
back in their chairs, smoking Cabinet Havanas.</p>

<p class="pindent">On the small tables beside them there was coffee and large
balloons of brandy. As M. and Bond came up, Drax was
tearing the paper cover off a new pack of cards. The other
pack was fanned out across the green baize in front of him.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Ah, there you are,” said Drax. He leant forward and cut
a card. They all followed suit. Drax won the cut and elected
to stay where he was and take the red cards.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat down on Drax’s left.</p>

<p class="pindent">M. beckoned to a passing waiter. “Coffee and the club
brandy,” he said. He took out a thin black cheroot and
offered one to Bond who accepted it. Then he picked up the
red cards and started to shuffle them.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Stakes?” asked Drax, looking at M. “One and One? Or
more? I’ll be glad to accommodate you up to Five and Five.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“One and One’ll be enough for me,” said M. “James?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax cut in, “I suppose your guest knows what he’s in
for?” he asked sharply.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond answered for M. “Yes,” he said briefly. He smiled at
Drax. “And I feel rather generous tonight. What would you
like to take off me?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Every penny you’ve got,” said Drax cheerfully. “How
much can you afford?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’ll tell you when there’s none left,” said Bond. He suddenly
decided to be ruthless. “I’m told that Five and Five is
your limit. Let’s play for that.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Almost before the words were out of his mouth he regretted
them. £50 a hundred! £500 side-bets! Four bad
rubbers would be double his income for a year. If something
went wrong he’d look pretty stupid. Have to borrow from
M. And M. wasn’t a particularly rich man. Suddenly he saw
that this ridiculous game might end in a very nasty mess. He
felt the prickle of sweat on his forehead. That damned benzedrine.
And, for him of all people to allow himself to be
needled by a blustering loud-mouthed bastard like Drax. And
he wasn’t even on a job. The whole evening was a bit of a
social pantomime that meant less than nothing to him. Even
M. had only been dragged into it by chance. And all of a
sudden he’d let himself be swept up into a duel with this
multi-millionaire, into a gamble for literally all Bond possessed,
for the simple reason that the man had got filthy manners
and he’d wanted to teach him a lesson. And supposing the
lesson didn’t come off? Bond cursed himself for an impulse
that earlier in the day would have seemed unthinkable.
Champagne and benzedrine! Never again.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax was looking at him in sarcastic disbelief. He turned
to M. who was still unconcernedly shuffling the cards. “I
suppose your guest is good for his commitments,” he said.
Unforgivably.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond saw the blood rush up M.’s neck and into his face.
M. paused for an instant in his shuffling. When he continued
Bond noticed that his hands were quite calm. M. looked up
and took the cheroot very deliberately out from between his
teeth. His voice was perfectly controlled. “If you mean ‘Am
I good for my guest’s commitments’,” he said coldly, “the
answer is yes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">He cut the cards to Drax with his left hand and with his
right knocked the ash off his cheroot into the copper ashtray
in the corner of the table. Bond heard the faint hiss as the
burning ash hit the water.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax squinted sideways at M. He picked up the cards. “Of
course, of course,” he said hastily. “I didn’t mean . . .” He
left the sentence unfinished and turned to Bond. “Right,
then,” he said, looking rather curiously at Bond. “Five and
Five it is. Meyer,” he turned to his partner, “how much
would you like to take? There’s Six and Six to cut up.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“One and One’s enough for me, Hugger,” said Meyer
apologetically. “Unless you’d like me to take some more.”
He looked anxiously at his partner.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course not,” said Drax. “I like a high game. Never
get enough on, generally. Now then,” he started to deal. “Off
we go.”</p>

<p class="pindent">And suddenly Bond didn’t care about the high stakes.
Suddenly all he wanted to do was to give this hairy ape the
lesson of his life, give him a shock which would make him
remember this evening for ever, remember Bond, remember
M., remember the last time he would cheat at Blades, remember
the time of day, the weather outside, what he had
had for dinner.</p>

<p class="pindent">For all its importance, Bond had forgotten the Moonraker.
This was a private affair between two men.</p>

<p class="pindent">As he watched the casual downward glance at the cigarette-case
between the two hands and felt the cool memory
ticking up the card values as they passed over its surface,
Bond cleared his mind of all regrets, absolved himself of all
blame for what was about to happen, and focused his attention
on the game. He settled himself more comfortably into
his chair and rested his hands on the padded leather arms.
Then he took the thin cheroot from between his teeth, laid
it on the burnished copper surround of the ashtray beside
him and reached for his coffee. It was very black and strong.
He emptied the cup and picked up the balloon glass with its
fat measure of pale brandy. As he sipped it and then drank
again, more deeply, he looked over the rim at M. M. met his
eye and smiled briefly.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Hope you like it,” he said. “Comes from one of the
Rothschild estates at Cognac. About a hundred years ago one
of the family bequeathed us a barrel of it every year in perpetuity.
During the war they hid a barrel for us every year
and then sent us over the whole lot in 1945. Ever since then
we’ve been drinking doubles. And,” he gathered up his cards,
“now we shall have to concentrate.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond picked up his hand. It was average. A bare two-and-a-half
quick tricks, the suits evenly distributed. He reached
for his cheroot and gave it a final draw, then killed it in the
ashtray.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Three clubs,” said Drax.</p>

<p class="pindent">No bid from Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">Four clubs from Meyer.</p>

<p class="pindent">No bid from M.</p>

<p class="pindent">Hm, thought Bond. He’s not quite got the cards for a game
call this time. Shut-out call—knows that his partner has got a
bare raise. M. may have got a perfectly good bid. We may
have all the hearts between us, for instance. But M. never
gets a bid. Presumably they’ll make four clubs.</p>

<p class="pindent">They did, with the help of one finesse through Bond. M.
turned out not to have had hearts, but a long string of diamonds,
missing only the king, which was in Meyer’s hand
and would have been caught. Drax didn’t have nearly
enough length for a three call. Meyer had the rest of the
clubs.</p>

<p class="pindent">Anyway, thought Bond as he dealt the next hand, we were
lucky to escape without a game call.</p>

<p class="pindent">Their good luck continued. Bond opened a No Trump,
was put up to three by M., and they made it with an over-trick.
On Meyer’s deal they went one down in five diamonds,
but on the next hand M. opened four spades and Bond’s
three small trumps and an outside king, queen were all M.
needed for the contract.</p>

<p class="pindent">First rubber to M. and Bond. Drax looked annoyed. He
had lost £900 on the rubber and the cards seemed to be
running against them.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Shall we go straight on?” he asked. “No point in cutting.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M. smiled across at Bond. The same thought was in both
their minds. So Drax wanted to keep the deal. Bond shrugged
his shoulders.</p>

<p class="pindent">“No objection,” said M. “These seats seem to be doing
their best for us.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Up to now,” said Drax, looking more cheerful.</p>

<p class="pindent">And with reason. On the next hand he and Meyer bid and
made a small slam in spades that required two hair-raising
finesses, both of which Drax, after a good deal of pantomime
and hemming and hawing, negotiated smoothly, each
time commenting loudly on his good fortune.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Hugger, you’re wonderful,” said Meyer fulsomely. “How
the devil do you do it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond thought it time to sow a tiny seed. “Memory,” he
said.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax looked at him, sharply. “What do you mean, memory?”
he said. “What’s that got to do with taking a finesse?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I was going to add ‘and card sense’,” said Bond smoothly.
“They’re the two qualities that make great card-players.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh,” said Drax slowly. “Yes, I see.” He cut the cards to
Bond and as Bond dealt he felt the other man’s eyes examining
him carefully.</p>

<p class="pindent">The game proceeded at an even pace. The cards refused to
get hot and no one seemed inclined to take chances. M.
doubled Meyer in an incautious four-spade bid and got him
two down vulnerable, but on the next hand Drax went out
with a lay down three No Trumps. Bond’s win on the first
rubber was wiped out and a bit more besides.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Anyone care for a drink?” asked M. as he cut the cards
to Drax for the third rubber. “James. A little more champagne.
The second bottle always tastes better.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’d like that very much,” said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">The waiter came. The others ordered whiskies and sodas.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax turned to Bond. “This game needs livening up,” he
said. “A hundred we win this hand.” He had completed the
deal and the cards lay in neat piles in the centre of the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked at him. The damaged eye glared at him redly.
The other was cold and hard and scornful. There were beads
of sweat on either side of the large, beaky nose.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond wondered if he was having a fly thrown over him to
see if he was suspicious of the deal. He decided to leave the
man in doubt. It was a hundred down the drain, but it would
give him an excuse for increasing the stakes later.</p>

<p class="pindent">“On your deal?” he said with a smile. “Well,” he weighed
imaginary chances. “Yes. All right.” An idea seemed to come
to him. “And the same on the next hand. If you like,” he
added.</p>

<p class="pindent">“All right, all right,” said Drax impatiently. “If you want
to throw good money after bad.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You seem very certain about this hand,” said Bond indifferently,
picking up his cards. They were a poor lot and he
had no answer to Drax’s opening No Trump except to double
it. The bluff had no effect on Drax’s partner. Meyer said
“Two No Trumps” and Bond was relieved when M., with no
long suit, said “No bid”. Drax left it in two No Trumps and
made the contract.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thanks,” he said with relish, and wrote carefully on his
score. “Now let’s see if you can get it back.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Much to his annoyance, Bond couldn’t. The cards still
ran for Meyer and Drax and they made three hearts and the
game.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax was pleased with himself. He took a long swallow at
his whisky and soda and wiped down his face with his bandana
handkerchief.</p>

<p class="pindent">“God is with the big battalions,” he said jovially. “Got to
have the cards as well as play them. Coming back for more or
had enough?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s champagne had come and was standing beside him
in its silver bucket. There was a glass goblet three-quarters
full beside it on the side table. Bond picked it up and drained
it, as if to give himself Dutch courage. Then he filled it again.</p>

<p class="pindent">“All right,” he said thickly, “a hundred on the next two
hands.”</p>

<p class="pindent">And promptly lost them both, and the rubber.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond suddenly realized that he was nearly £1,500 down.
He drank another glass of champagne. “Save trouble if we
just double the stakes on this rubber,” he said rather wildly.
“All right with you?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax had dealt and was looking at his cards. His lips were
wet with anticipation. He looked at Bond who seemed to be
having difficulty lighting his cigarette. “Taken,” he said
quickly. “A hundred pounds a hundred and a thousand on
the rubber.” Then he felt he could risk a touch of sportsmanship.
Bond could hardly cancel the bet now. “But I seem to
have got some good tickets here,” he added. “Are you still
on?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course, of course,” said Bond, clumsily picking up his
hand. “I made the bet, didn’t I?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“All right, then,” said Drax with satisfaction. “Three No
Trumps here.”</p>

<p class="pindent">He made four.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then, to Bond’s relief, the cards turned. Bond bid and
made a small slam in hearts and on the next hand M. ran out
in three No Trumps.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond grinned cheerfully into the sweating face. Drax was
picking angrily at his nails. “Big battalions,” said Bond, rubbing
it in.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax growled something and busied himself with the score.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked across at M., who was putting a match, with
evident satisfaction at the way the game had gone, to his
second cheroot of the evening, an almost unheard of indulgence.</p>

<p class="pindent">“ ’Fraid this’ll have to be my last rubber,” said Bond. “Got
to get up early. Hope you’ll forgive me.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M. looked at his watch. “It’s past midnight,” he said.
“What about you, Meyer?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Meyer, who had been a silent passenger for most of the
evening and who had the look of a man caught in a cage with
a couple of tigers, seemed relieved at being offered a chance
of making his escape. He leapt at the idea of getting back to
his quiet flat in Albany and the soothing companionship of
his collection of Battersea snuff-boxes.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Quite all right with me, Admiral,” he said quickly. “What
about you, Hugger? Nearly ready for bed?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax ignored him. He looked up from his score-sheet at
Bond. He noticed the signs of intoxication. The moist forehead,
the black comma of hair that hung untidily over the
right eyebrow, the sheen of alcohol in the grey-blue eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Pretty miserable balance so far,” he said. “I make it you
win a couple of hundred or so. Of course if you want to run
out of the game you can. But how about some fireworks to
finish up with? Treble the stakes on the last rubber? Fifteen
and fifteen? Historic match. Am I on?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked up at him. He paused before answering. He
wanted Drax to remember every detail of this last rubber,
every word that had been spoken, every gesture.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well,” said Drax impatiently. “What about it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked into the cold left eye in the flushed face. He
spoke to it alone.</p>

<p class="pindent">“One hundred and fifty pounds a hundred, and £1,500
on the rubber,” he said distinctly. “You’re on.”</p>
