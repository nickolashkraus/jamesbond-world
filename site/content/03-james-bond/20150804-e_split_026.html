<p class="pindent">“Then we’re all agreed?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, Sir Hugo,” it was the Minister of Supply speaking.
Bond recognized the dapper, assured figure. “Those are
the settings. My people have checked them independently
with the Air Ministry this morning.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Then if you’ll allow me the privilage,” Drax held up the
slip of paper and made to turn towards the launching-dome.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Hold it, Sir Hugo. Just like that, please. Arm in the air.”
The bulbs flashed and the bank of cameras whirred and
clicked for the last time and Drax turned and walked the few
yards towards the dome, almost, it seemed to Bond, looking
him straight in the eye through the grating above the door
of the site.</p>

<p class="pindent">The small crowd of reporters and cameramen dissolved
and straggled off across the concrete apron, leaving only a
nervously chatting group of officials to wait for Drax to
emerge.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked at his watch. 11.45. Hurry up, damn you, he
thought.</p>

<p class="pindent">For the hundredth time he repeated to himself the figures
Gala had taught him during the hours of cramped pain that
had followed their ordeal by steam, and for the hundredth
time he shifted his limbs to keep the circulation going.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Get ready,” he whispered into Gala’s ear. “Are you all
right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">He could feel the girl smile. “Fine.” She shut her mind to
the thought of her blistered legs and the quick rasping descent
back down the ventilator shaft.</p>

<p class="pindent">The door clanged shut beneath them followed by the click
of the lock and, preceded by the five guards, the figure of
Drax appeared below striding masterfully towards the group
of officials, the slip of lying figures in his hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked at his watch. 11.47. “Now,” he whispered.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Good luck,” she whispered back.</p>

<p class="pindent">Slither, scrape, rip. His shoulders carefully expanding and
contracting; blistered, bloodstained feet scrabbling for the
sharp knobs of iron, Bond, his lacerated body tearing its way
down the forty feet of shaft, prayed that the girl would have
strength to stand it when she followed.</p>

<p class="pindent">A last ten-foot drop that jarred his spine, a kick at the
grating and he was out on the steel floor and running for the
stairs, leaving a trail of red footprints and a spray of blood-drops
from his raw shoulders.</p>

<p class="pindent">The arcs had been extinguished, but the daylight streamed
down through the open roof and the blue from the sky
mingling with the fierce glitter of the sunshine gave Bond
the impression that he was running up inside a huge sapphire.</p>

<p class="pindent">The great deadly needle in the centre might have been
made of glass. Looking above him as he sweated and panted
up the endless sweep of the iron stairway, it was difficult for
him to see where its tapering nose ended and the sky began.</p>

<p class="pindent">Behind the crouching silence that enveloped the shimmering
bullet, Bond could hear a quick, deadly ticking, the hasty
tripping of tiny metal feet somewhere in the body of the
Moonraker. It filled the great steel chamber like the beating
heart in Poe’s story and Bond knew that directly Drax at the
firing point pressed the switch that sent the radio beam zinging
over two hundred yards to the waiting rocket, the ticking
would suddenly cease, there would be the soft whine of the
lighted pinwheel, a wisp of steam from the turbines, and then
the howling jet of flame on which the rocket would slowly
rise and sweep majestically out on the start of its gigantic
acceleration curve.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then in front of him there was the spidery arm of the
gantry folded back against the wall and Bond’s hand was at
the lever and the arm was slowly stretching down and out
towards the square hairline on the glittering skin of the rocket
that was the door of the gyro chamber.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond, on hands and knees, was along it even before the
rubber pads came to rest against the polished chrome. There
was the flush disc the size of a shilling, just as Gala had described.
Press, click, and the tiny door had flicked open on its
hard spring. Inside. Careful not to cut your head. The gleaming
handles beneath the staring compass-roses. Turn. Twist.
Steady. That’s for the roll. Now the pitch and yaw. Turn.
Twist. Ever so gently. And steady. A last look. A glance at his
watch. Four minutes to go. Don’t panic. Back out. Door click.
A cat-like scurry. Don’t look down. Gantry up. Clang against
the wall. And now for the stairs.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tick-tick-tick-tick.</p>

<p class="pindent">As Bond shot down he caught a glimpse of Gala’s tense,
white face as she stood holding open the outer door of Drax’s
office. God, how his body hurt! A final leap and a clumsy
swerve to the right. Clang as Gala slammed the outer door.
Another clang and they were across the room and into the
shower and the water was hissing down on their clinging,
panting bodies.</p>

<p class="pindent">Through the noise of it all, above the beating of his heart,
Bond heard the sudden crackle of static and then the voice of
the BBC announcer coming from the big set in Drax’s room
a few inches away through the thin wall of the bathroom. It
had been Gala again who had remembered Drax’s wireless
and who had found time to throw the switches while Bond
was working on the gyros.</p>

<p class="pindent">“. . . be five minutes’ delay,” said the breezy, excited voice.
“Sir Hugo has been persuaded to say a few words into the
microphone.” Bond turned off the shower and the voice came
to them more clearly. “He looks very confident. Just saying
something into the Minister’s ear. They’re both laughing.
Wonder what it was? Ah, here’s my colleague with the latest
weather report from the Air Ministry. What’s that? Perfect
at all altitudes. Good show. It certainly is a wonderful day
down below here. Haha. Those crowds in the distance by
the coastguard station will be getting quite a sunburn. There
must be thousands. What’s that you say? Twenty thousand?
Well, it certainly looks like it. And Walmer Beach is black
with them too. The whole of Kent seems to be out. Terrible
crick in the neck we’re all going to get, I’m afraid. Worse
than Wimbledon. Haha. Hullo, what’s going on down there
by the jetty? By jove, there’s a submarine just surfaced alongside.
I say, what a sight. One of our biggest I should say. And
Sir Hugo’s team is down there too. Lined up on the jetty as
if they were on parade. Magnificent body of men. Now
they’re filing on board. Perfect discipline. Must be an idea of
the Admiralty’s. Give them a special grandstand out in the
Channel. Splendid show. Wish you could be here to see it.
Now Sir Hugo is coming towards us. In a moment he’ll be
speaking to you. Fine figure of a man. Everyone in the firing
point is giving him a cheer. I’m sure we all feel like cheering
him today. He’s coming into the firing point. I can see the sun
glinting on the nose of the Moonraker way over there behind
him. Just showing out of the top of the launching dome. Hope
somebody’s got a camera. Now here he is,” a pause. “Sir
Hugo Drax.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked into Gala’s dripping face. Soaked and bleeding
they stood in each other’s arms, speechless and trembling
slightly with the storm of their emotions. Their eyes were
blank and fathomless as they met and held each other’s gaze.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Your Majesty, men and women of England,” the voice
was a velvet snarl. “I am about to change the course of
England’s history.” A pause. “In a few minutes’ time the
lives of all of you will be altered, in some cases, ahem, drastically,
by the, er, impact of the Moonraker. I am very proud
and pleased that fate has singled me out, from amongst all
my fellow countrymen, to fire this great arrow of vengeance
into the skies and thus to proclaim for all time, and for all
the world to witness, the might of my fatherland. I hope that
this occasion will be forever a warning that the fate of my
country’s enemies will be written in dust, in ashes, in tears,
and,” a pause, “in blood. And now thank you all for listening
and I sincerely hope that those of you who are able will repeat
my words to your children, if you have any, tonight.”</p>

<p class="pindent">A rattle of rather hesitant applause sounded out of the
machine and then came the breezy voice of the announcer.
“And that was Sir Hugo Drax saying a few words to you
before he walks across the floor of the firing point to the
switch on the wall which will fire the Moonraker. The first
time he has spoken in public. Very, ahem, forthright. Doesn’t
mince his words. However, a lot of us will say there’s no harm
in that. And now it’s time for me to hand over to the expert,
Group Captain Tandy of the Ministry of Supply, who will
describe to you the actual firing of the Moonraker. After that
you will hear Peter Trimble in one of the naval security
patrol, HMS <span class="it">Merganzer</span>, describe the scene in the target
area. Group Captain Tandy.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond glanced at his watch. “Only a minute more,” he said
to Gala. “God, I’d like to get my hands on Drax. Here,” he
reached for the cake of soap and gouged some pieces off it.
“Stuff this in your ears when the time comes. The noise is
going to be terrific, I don’t know about the heat. It won’t last
long and the steel walls may stand up to it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala looked at him. She smiled. “If you hold me it won’t
be too bad,” she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">“. . . and now Sir Hugo has his hand on the switch and
he’s watching the chronometer.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“TEN,” broke in another voice, heavy and sonorous as the
toll of a bell.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned on the shower and the water hissed down on
their clinging bodies.</p>

<p class="pindent">“NINE,” tolled the voice of the time-keeper.</p>

<p class="pindent">“. . . the radar operators are watching the screens. Nothing
but a mass of wavy lines. . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">“EIGHT.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“. . . all wearing ear-plugs. Blockhouse should be indestructible.
Concrete walls are twelve feet thick. Pyramid roof,
twenty-seven feet thick at the point . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">“SEVEN.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“. . . first the radio beam will stop the time mechanism
alongside the turbines. Set the pinwheel going. Flaming
thing like a Catherine wheel. . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">“SIX.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“. . . valves will open. Liquid fuel. Secret formula. Terrific
stuff. Dynamite. Pours down from the fuel tanks . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">“FIVE.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“. . . ignited by the pinwheel when the fuel gets to the
rocket motor. . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">“FOUR.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“. . . meanwhile the peroxide and permanganate have
mixed, made steam and the turbine pumps begin to turn . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">“THREE.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“. . . pumping the flaming fuel through the motor out of
the stern of the rocket into the exhaust pit. Gigantic heat . . .
3500 degrees. . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">“TWO.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“. . . Sir Hugo is about to press the switch. He’s staring out
through the slit. Perspiration on his forehead. Absolute
silence in here. Terrific tension.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“ONE.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Nothing but the noise of the water, steadily pouring down
on the two clinging bodies.</p>

<p class="pindent">FIRE!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s heart jumped into his throat at the shout. He felt
Gala shudder. Silence. Nothing but the hissing of the
water. . . .</p>

<p class="pindent">“. . . Sir Hugo’s left the firing point. Walking calmly over
to the edge of the cliff. So confident. He’s stepped on to the
hoist. He’s going down. Of course. He must be going out to
the submarine. Television screen shows a little steam coming
out of the tail of the rocket. A few more seconds. Yes, he’s
out on the jetty. He looked back and raised his arm in the air.
Good old Sir Hu . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">A soft thunder came to Bond and Gala. Louder. Louder.
The tiled floor began to tremble under their feet. A hurricane
scream. They were being pulverized by it. The walls
were quaking, steaming. Their legs began going out of control
under their teetering bodies. Hold her up. Hold her up.
Stop it! Stop it!! STOP THAT NOISE!!!</p>

<p class="pindent">Christ, he was going to faint. The water was boiling. Must
turn it off. Got it. No. Pipe’s burst. Steam, smell, iron, paint.</p>

<p class="pindent">Get her out! Get her out!! Get her out!!!</p>

<p class="pindent">And then there was silence. Silence you could feel, hold,
squeeze. And they were on the floor of Drax’s office. Only
the light in the bathroom still shining out. And the smoke’s
clearing. And the filthy smell of burning iron and paint.
Being sucked out by the air-conditioner. And the steel wall is
bent towards them like a huge blister. Gala’s eyes are open
and she’s smiling. But the rocket. What happened? London?
North Sea? The radio. Looks all right. He shook his head and
the deafness slowly cleared. He remembered the soap.
Gouged it out.</p>

<p class="pindent">“. . . through the sound barrier. Travelling perfectly right
in the centre of the radar screen. A perfect launching. Afraid
you couldn’t hear anything because of the noise. Terrific.
First of all the great sheet of flame coming out of the cliff
from the exhaust pit and then you should have seen the nose
slowly creep up out of the dome. And there she was like a
great silver pencil. Standing upright on this huge column of
flame and slowly climbing into the air and the flame splashing
for hundreds of yards over the concrete. The howl of the
thing must have nearly burst our microphones. Great bits
have fallen off the cliff and the concrete looks like a spider’s
web. Terrible vibration. And then she was climbing faster
and faster. A hundred miles an hour. A thousand. And,” he
broke off, “what’s that you say? Really! And now she’s
travelling at over ten thousand miles an hour! She’s three
hundred miles up. Can’t hear her any more, of course. We
could only see her flame for a few seconds. Like a star. Sir
Hugo must be a proud man. He’s out there in the Channel
now. The submarine went off like a rocket, haha, must be
doing more than thirty knots. Throwing up a huge wake. Off
the East Goodwins now. Travelling north. She’ll soon be up
with the patrol ships. They’ll have a view of the launching
and of the landing. Quite a surprise trip that. No one here
had an inkling. Even the naval authorities seem a bit mystified.
C-in-C Nore has been on the telephone. But now that’s
all I can tell you from here and I’ll hand you over to Peter
Trimble on board HMS <span class="it">Merganzer</span> somewhere off the East
Coast.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Nothing but the pumping lungs showed that the two limp
bodies in the creeping pool of water on the floor were still
alive, but their battered ear-drums were desperately clinging
to the crackle of static that came briefly from the blistered
metal cabinet. Now for the verdict on their work.</p>

<p class="pindent">“And this is Peter Trimble speaking. It’s a beautiful morning,
I mean—er—afternoon here. Just north of the Goodwin
Sands. Calm as a millpond. No wind. Bright sunshine.
And the target area is reported clear of shipping. Is that
right, Commander Edwards? Yes, the Captain says it’s quite
clear. Nothing on the radar screens yet. I’m not allowed to
tell you the range we shall pick her up at. Security and all
that. But we shall only catch the rocket for a split second.
Isn’t that right, Captain? But the target’s just showing on
the screen. Out of sight from the bridge, of course. Must be
seventy miles north of here. We could see the Moonraker
going up. Terrific sight. Noise like thunder. Long flame
coming out of the tail. Must have been ten miles away but
you couldn’t miss the light. Yes, Captain? Oh yes, I see.
Well, that’s very interesting. Big submarine coming up fast.
Only about a mile away. Suppose it’s the one they say Sir
Hugo’s aboard with his men. None of us here were told anything
about her. Captain Edwards says she doesn’t answer
the Aldis lamp. Not flying colours. Very mysterious. I’ve
got her now. Quite clear in my glasses. We’ve changed course
to intercept her. Captain says she isn’t one of ours. Thinks
she must be a foreigner. Hullo! She’s broken out her colours.
<span class="it">What’s</span> that? Good heavens. The Captain says she’s a Russian.
I say! And now she’s hauled down her colours and she’s
submerging. Bang. Did you hear that? We fired a shot across
her bows. But she’s disappeared. What’s that? The asdic
operator says she’s going even faster under water. Twenty-five
knots. Terrific. Well, she can’t see much under water.
But she’s right in the target area now. Twelve minutes past
noon. The Moonraker must have turned and be on her way
down. A thousand miles up. Coming down at ten thousand
miles an hour. She’ll be here any second now. Hope there’s
not going to be a tragedy. The Russian’s well inside the
danger zone. The radar operator’s holding up his hand. That
means she’s due. She’s coming. She’s COMING . . . . Whew!
Not even a whisper. GOD! What’s that? Look out! Look
out! Terrific explosion. Black cloud going up into the air.
There’s a tidal wave coming at us. Great wall of water tearing
down. There goes the submarine. God! Thrown out of
the water upside down. It’s coming. It’s COMING . . .”</p>
