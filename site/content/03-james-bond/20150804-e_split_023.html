<p class="pindent">Krebs echoed the maniac laugh with a high giggle. “A
master-stroke, <span class="it">mein Kapitän</span>. You should have seen them
charge off down the hill. The one that burst. <span class="it">Wunderschön!</span>
Like the lavatory paper of a giant. That one will have made
a pretty parcel of him. He was just coming round the bend.
And the second salvo was as good as the first. Did you see the
driver’s face? <span class="it">Zum Kotzen!</span> And the <span class="it">Firma</span> Bowater! A fine
paperchase they have got on their hands.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You did well,” said Drax briefly, his mind elsewhere.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly he pulled into the side of the road with a scream
of protest from the tyres.</p>

<p class="pindent">“<span class="it">Donnerwetter</span>,” he said angrily, as he started to turn the
car. “But we can’t leave the man there. We must get him.”
The car was already hissing back down the road. “Gun,”
ordered Drax briefly.</p>

<p class="pindent">They passed the lorry at the top of the hill. It was stopped
and there was no sign of the driver. Probably telephoning to
the company, thought Drax, slowing up as they went round
the first bend. There were lights on in the two or three houses
and a group of people were standing round one of the rolls
of newsprint that lay amongst the ruins of their front gate.
There were more rolls in the hedge on the right side of the
road. On the left a telegraph pole leant drunkenly, snapped
in the middle. Then at the next bend was the beginning of a
great confusion of paper stretching away down the long hill,
festooning the hedges and the road like the sweepings of
some elephantine fancy-dress ball.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Bentley had nearly broken through the railings that
fenced off the right of the bend from a steep bank. Amidst a
puzzle of twisted iron stanchions it hung, nose down, with
one wheel, still attached to the broken back axle, poised
crookedly over its rump like a surrealist umbrella.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax pulled up and he and Krebs got out and stood
quietly, listening.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was no sound except the distant rumination of a
car travelling fast on the Ashford road and the chirrup of a
sleepless cricket.</p>

<p class="pindent">With their guns out they walked cautiously over to the
remains of the Bentley, their feet crunching the broken glass
on the road. Deep furrows had been cut across the grass verge
and there was a strong smell of petrol and burnt rubber in
the air. The hot metal of the car ticked and crackled softly
and steam was still fountaining from the shattered radiator.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was lying face downwards at the bottom of the bank
twenty feet away from the car. Krebs turned him over. His
face was covered with blood but he was breathing. They
searched him thoroughly and Drax pocketed the slim Beretta.
Then together they hauled him across the road and
wedged him into the back seat of the Mercedes, half on top
of Gala.</p>

<p class="pindent">When she realized who it was she gave a cry of horror.</p>

<p class="pindent">“<span class="it">Halt’s Maul</span>,” snarled Drax. He got into the front seat
and while he turned the car Krebs leant over from the front
seat and busied himself with a long piece of flex. “Make a
good job of it,” said Drax. “I don’t want any mistakes.” He
had an afterthought. “And then go back to the wreck and
get the number plates. Hurry. I will watch the road.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Krebs pulled the rug over the two inert bodies and jumped
out of the car. Using his knife as a screwdriver he was soon
back with the plates, and the big car started to move just as
a group of the local residents appeared walking nervously
down the hill shining their torches over the scene of devastation.</p>

<p class="pindent">Krebs grinned happily to himself at the thought of the
stupid English having to clean up all this mess. He settled
himself back to enjoy the part of the drive he had always
liked best, the spring woods full of bluebells and celandines
on the way to Chilham.</p>

<p class="pindent">They had made him particularly happy at night. Lit up
amongst the green torches of the young trees by the great
headlamps of the Mercedes, they made him think of the
beautiful forests of the Ardennes and of the devoted little
band with which he had served, and of driving along in a
captured American jeep with, just like tonight, his adored
leader at the wheel. <span class="it">Der Tag</span> had been a long time coming,
but now it was here. With young Krebs in the van. At last
the cheering crowds, the medals, the women, the flowers. He
gazed out at the fleeting hosts of bluebells and felt warm and
happy.</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala could taste Bond’s blood. His face was beside hers
on the leather seat and she shifted to give him more room.
His breathing was heavy and irregular and she wondered
how badly he was hurt. Tentatively she whispered into his
ear. And then louder. He groaned and his breath came faster.</p>

<p class="pindent">“James,” she whispered urgently. “James.”</p>

<p class="pindent">He mumbled something and she pushed hard against him.</p>

<p class="pindent">He uttered a string of obscenities and his body heaved.</p>

<p class="pindent">He lay still again and she could almost feel him exploring
his sensations.</p>

<p class="pindent">“It’s me, Gala.” She felt him stiffen.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Christ,” he said. “Hell of a mess.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Are you all right? Is anything broken?”</p>

<p class="pindent">She felt him tense his arms and legs. “Seems all right,” he
said. “Crack on the head. Am I talking sense?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course,” said Gala. “Now listen.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Hurriedly she told him all she knew, beginning with the
notebook.</p>

<p class="pindent">His body was as rigid as a board against her, and he hardly
breathed as he listened to the incredible story.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then they were running into Canterbury and Bond put
his mouth to her ear. “Going to try and chuck myself over
the back,” he whispered. “Get to a telephone. Only hope.”</p>

<p class="pindent">He started to heave himself up on his knees, his weight
almost grinding the breath out of the girl.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a sharp crack and he fell back on top of her.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Another move out of you and you’re dead,” said the voice
of Krebs coming softly between the front seats.</p>

<p class="pindent">Only another twenty minutes to the site! Gala gritted her
teeth and set about bringing Bond back to consciousness
again.</p>

<p class="pindent">She had only just succeeded when the car drew up at the
door of the launching-dome and Krebs, a gun in his hand,
was undoing the bonds round their ankles.</p>

<p class="pindent">They had a glimpse of the familiar moonlit cement and of
the semi-circle of guards some distance away before they were
hustled through the door and, when their shoes had been
torn off by Krebs, out on to the iron catwalk inside the
launching-dome.</p>

<p class="pindent">There the gleaming rocket stood, beautiful, innocent, like
a new toy for Cyclops.</p>

<p class="pindent">But there was a horrible smell of chemicals in the air and
to Bond the Moonraker was a giant hypodermic needle ready
to be plunged into the heart of England. Despite a growl
from Krebs he paused on the stairway and looked up at its
glittering nose. A million deaths. A million. A million. A
million.</p>

<p class="pindent">On his hands? For God’s sake! On <span class="it">his</span> hands?</p>

<p class="pindent">With Krebs’s gun prodding him, he went slowly down the
steps on the heels of Gala.</p>

<p class="pindent">As he turned through the doors of Drax’s office, he pulled
himself together. Suddenly his mind was clear and all the
lethargy and pain had left his body. Something, anything,
must be done. Somehow he would find a way. His whole body
and mind became focused and sharp as a blade. His eyes were
alive again and defeat sloughed off him like the skin of a
snake.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax had gone ahead and was sitting at his desk. He had a
Luger in his hand. It was pointing at a spot halfway between
Bond and Gala and it was steady as a rock.</p>

<p class="pindent">Behind him, Bond heard the double doors thud shut.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I was one of the best shots in the Brandenburg Division,”
said Drax conversationally. “Tie her to that chair, Krebs.
Then the man.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala looked desperately at Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You won’t shoot,” said Bond. “You’d be afraid of touching
off the fuel.” He walked slowly towards the desk.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax smiled cheerfully and looked along the barrel at
Bond’s stomach. “Your memory is bad, Englishman,” he said
flatly. “I told you this room is cut off from the shaft by the
double doors. Another step and you will have no stomach.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked at the confident, narrowed eyes and stopped.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Go ahead, Krebs.”</p>

<p class="pindent">When they were both tied securely and painfully to the
arms and legs of two tubular steel chairs a few feet apart
beneath the glass wall-map, Krebs left the room. He came
back in a moment with a mechanic’s blowtorch.</p>

<p class="pindent">He set the ugly machine on the desk, pumped air into it
with a few brisk strokes of the plunger, and set a match to it.
A blue flame hissed out a couple of inches into the room.
He picked up the instrument and walked towards Gala. He
stopped a few feet to one side of her.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Now then,” said Drax grimly. “Let’s get this over without
any fuss. The good Krebs is an artist with one of those
things. We used to call him <span class="it">Der Zwangsman</span>—The Persuader.
I shall never forget the way he went over the last spy
we caught together. Just south of the Rhine, wasn’t it,
Krebs?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond pricked up his ears.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, <span class="it">mein Kapitän</span>.” Krebs chuckled reminiscently. “It
was a pig of a Belgian.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“All right then,” said Drax. “Just remember, you two.
There’s no fair play down here. No jolly good sports and all
that. This is business.” The voice cracked like a whip on the
word. “You,” he looked at Gala Brand, “who are you working
for?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala was silent.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Anywhere you like, Krebs.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Krebs’s mouth was half open. His tongue ran up and down
his lower lip. He seemed to be having difficulty with his
breathing as he took a step towards the girl.</p>

<p class="pindent">The little flame roared greedily.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Stop,” said Bond coldly. “She works for Scotland Yard.
So do I.” These things were pointless now. They were of no
conceivable use to Drax. In any case, by tomorrow afternoon
there might be no Scotland Yard.</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s better,” said Drax. “Now, does anybody know you
are prisoners? Did you stop and telephone anyone?”</p>

<p class="pindent">If I say yes, thought Bond, he will shoot us both and get
rid of the bodies and the last chance of stopping the Moonraker
will be gone. And if the Yard knows, why aren’t they
here already? No. Our chance may come. The Bentley will
be found. Vallance may get worried when he doesn’t hear
from me.</p>

<p class="pindent">“No,” he said. “If I had, they’d be here by now.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“True,” said Drax reflectively. “In that case I am no longer
interested in you and I congratulate you on making the interview
so harmonious. It might have been more difficult if you
had been alone. A girl is always useful on these occasions.
Krebs, put that down. You may go. Tell the others what is
necessary. They will be wondering. I shall entertain our
guests for a while and then I shall come up to the house. See
the car gets properly washed down. The back seat. And get
rid of the marks on the right-hand side. Tell them to take the
whole panel off if necessary. Or they can set fire to the
dam’ thing. We shan’t be needing it any more,” he laughed
abruptly. “<span class="it">Verstanden?</span>”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, <span class="it">mein Kapitän</span>.” Krebs reluctantly placed the softly
roaring blowtorch on the desk beside Drax. “In case you
need it,” he said, looking hopefully at Gala and Bond. He
went out through the double doors.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax put the Luger down on the desk in front of him. He
opened a drawer and took out a cigar and lit it from a Ronson
desk lighter. Then he settled himself comfortably. There was
silence in the room for several minutes while Drax puffed
contentedly at his cigar. Then he seemed to make up his
mind. He looked benevolently at Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You don’t know how I have longed for an English audience,”
he said as if he was addressing a Press conference.
“You don’t know how I have longed to tell my story. As a
matter of fact, a full account of my operations is now in the
hands of a very respectable firm of Edinburgh solicitors. I beg
their pardon—Writers to the Signet. Well out of danger.” He
beamed from one to the other. “And these good folk have
instructions to open the envelope on the completion of the
first successful flight of the Moonraker. But you lucky people
shall have a preview of what I have written and then, when
tomorrow at noon you see through those open doors,” he
gestured to his right, “the first wisp of steam from the turbines
and know that you are to be burnt alive in about half a
second, you will have the momentary satisfaction of knowing
what it is all in aid of, as,” he grinned wolfishly, “we Englishmen
say.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You can spare us the jokes,” said Bond roughly. “Get on
with your story, Kraut.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax’s eyes blazed momentarily. “A Kraut. Yes, I am indeed
a <span class="it">Reischsdeutscher</span>”—the mouth beneath the red moustache
savoured the fine word—“and even England will soon
agree that they have been licked by just one single German.
And then perhaps they’ll stop calling us Krauts—BY
ORDER!” The words were yelled out and the whole of
Prussian militarism was in the parade-ground bellow.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax glowered across the desk at Bond, the great splayed
teeth under the red moustache tearing nervously at one
fingernail after another. Then, with an effort, he crammed
his right hand into his trouser pocket, as if to put it out of
temptation, and picked up his cigar with his left. He puffed
at it for a moment and then, his voice still taut, he began.</p>
