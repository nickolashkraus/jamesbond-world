<p class="line9">The setup was the same. Bond’s travel literature was on
the buffet table, where he had left it. He went through
into the conference room. It had only been cursorily tidied.
Scaramanga had probably said it was not to be entered
by the staff. The chairs were roughly in position,
but the ashtrays had not been emptied. There were no
stains on the carpet and no signs of the carpet having
been washed. It had probably been a single shot through
the heart. With Scaramanga’s soft-nosed bullets, the internal
damage would be devastating, but the fragments
of the bullet would stay in the body and there would be
no bleeding. Bond went round the table, ostentatiously
positioning the chairs more accurately. He identified the
one Ruby Rotkopf must have sat in across the table from
Scaramanga—because it had a cracked leg. He dutifully
examined the windows and looked behind the curtains,
doing his job. Scaramanga came into the room followed
by Mr. Hendriks. He said roughly, “Okay, Mr. Hazard.
Lock both doors like yesterday. No one to come in.
Right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes.” As Bond passed Mr. Hendriks he said cheerfully,
“Good morning, Mr. Hendriks. Enjoy the party
last night?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr. Hendriks gave his usual curt bow. He said nothing.
His eyes were granite marbles.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond went out and locked the doors and took up his
position with the brochures and the champagne glass.
Immediately, Hendriks began talking, quickly and urgently,
rumbling for the English words. “Mister S. I
have bad troubles to report. My Zentrale in Havana
spoke with me this morning. They have heard direct
from Moscow. This man”—he must have made a gesture
towards the door—“this man is the British secret agent,
the man Bond. There is no doubt. I am given the exact
descriptions. When he goes swimming this morning, I
am examining his body through glasses. The wounds on
his body are clearly to be seen. The scar down the right
side of the face leaves no doubt. And his shooting last
night! The ploddy fool is proud of his shooting. I would
like to see a member of my organization behave in zees
stupid fashions! I would have him shot immediately.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a pause. The man’s tone altered, became
slightly menacing. His target was now Scaramanga.
“But, Mister S. How can this have come about? How can
you possibly have let it arrive? My Zentrale is dumbfounded
at the mistake. The man might have done
much damage but for the watchfulness of my superiors.
Please explain, Mister S. I must be making the very full
report. How is it that you are meeting this man? How is
that you are then carrying him efen into the centre of
The Group? The details, pliss, Mister S. The full accounting.
My superiors will be expressing sharp criticism
of the lack of vigilance against the enemy.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond heard the rasp of a match against a box. He
could imagine Scaramanga sitting back and going
through the smoking routine. The voice, when it came,
was decisive, uncowed. “Mr. Hendriks, I appreciate your
outfit’s concern about this and I congratulate them on
their sources of information. But you tell your Central
this: I met this man completely by accident, at least I
thought so at the time, and there’s no use worrying about
how it happened. It hasn’t been easy to set up this conference
and I needed help. I had to get two managers in a
hurry from New York to handle the hotel people.
They’re doing a good job, right? The floor staff and all
the rest I had to get from Kingston. But what I really
needed was a kind of personal assistant who could be
around to make sure that everything went smoothly. Personally,
I just couldn’t be bothered with all the details.
When this guy dropped out of the blue, he looked all
right to me. So I picked him up. But I’m not stupid. I
knew that when this show was over I’d have to get rid
of him, just in case he’d learned anything he shouldn’t
have. Now you say he’s a member of the Secret Service. I
told you at the beginning of this conference that I eat
these people for breakfast when I have a mind to. What
you’ve told me changes just one thing: he’ll die today instead
of tomorrow. And here’s how it’s going to happen.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga lowered his voice. Now Bond could only
hear disjointed words. The sweat ran down from his ear
as he pressed it to the base of the champagne glass. “Our
train trip . . . rats in the cane . . . unfortunate accident
. . . before I do it . . . one hell of a shock . . .
details to myself . . . promise you a big laugh.” Scaramanga
must have sat back again. Now his voice was normal.
“So you can rest easy. There’ll be nothing left of
the guy by this evening. Okay? I could get it over with
now by just opening the door. But two blown fuses in
two days might stir up gossip around here. And this way
there’ll be a heap of fun for everyone on the picnic.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr. Hendriks’ voice was flat and uninterested. He had
carried out his orders, and action was about to follow,
definitive action. There could be no complaint of delay
in carrying out orders. He said, “Yes. What you are proposing
will be satisfactory. I shall observe the proceedings
with much amusement. And now to other business.
Plan Orange. My superiors are wishing to know that
everything is in order.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes. Everything’s in order at Reynolds Metal, Kaiser
Bauxite, and Alumina of Jamaica. But your stuff’s
plenty—what do they call it?—volatile. Got to be replaced
in the demolition chambers every five years.
Hey,” there was a dry chuckle, “I sure snickered when I
saw that the how-to-do-it labels on the drums were in
some of these African languages as well as English.
Ready for the big black uprising, huh? You better warn
me about The Day. I hold some pretty vulnerable stocks
on Wall Street.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Then you will lose a lot of money,” said Mr. Hendriks
flatly. “I shall not be told the date. I do not mind. I
hold no stocks. You would be wise to keep your money
in gold or diamonds or rare postage stamps. And now
the next matter. It is of interest to my superiors to be
able to place their hands on a very great quantity of narcotics.
You have a source for the supply of ganja, or marijuana
as we call it. You are now receiving your supplies
in pound weight. I am asking whether you can stimulate
your sources of supply to providing the weed by the
hundredweight. It is suggested that you then run shipments
to the Pedro Cays. My friends can arrange for collection
from there.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a brief silence. Scaramanga would be smoking
his thin cheroot. He said, “Yeah, I think we could
swing that. But they’ve just put some big teeth into these
ganja laws. Real rough jail sentences, see? So the goddam
price has up and gone through the roof. The going price
today is sixteen pounds an ounce. A hundredweight of
the stuff could cost thousands of pounds. And it’s darned
bulky in those quantities. My fishing boat could probably
only ship one hundredweight at a time. Anyway,
where’s it for? You’ll be lucky to get those quantities
ashore. A pound or two is difficult enough.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I am not being told the destinations. I assume it is for
America. I am under the impression that they are the
largest consumers. Arrangements have been made to receive
this and other consignments initially off the coast
of Georgia. I am being told that this area is full of small
islands and swamps and is already much favoured by
smugglers. The money is of no importance. I have instructions
to make an initial outlay of a million dollars,
but at keen market prices. You will be receiving your
usual ten percent commission. Is it that you are interested?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m always interested in a hundred thousand dollars.
I’ll have to get in touch with my growers. They have
their plantations in the Maroon country. That’s in the
centre of the island. This is going to take time. I can give
you a quotation in about two weeks—a hundredweight
of the stuff f.o.b. the Pedro Cays. Okay?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“And a date? The Cays are very flat. This is not stuff
to be left lying about, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sure. Sure. Now then. Any other business? Okay.
Well, I’ve got something I’d like to bring up. This casino
lark. Now, this is the picture. The government is
tempted. They think it’ll stimulate the tourist industry.
But the heavies—the boys who were kicked out of Havana,
the Vegas machine, the Miami jokers, Chicago, the
whole works—didn’t take the measure of these people
before they put the heat on. And they overplayed the
slush fund approach—put too much money in the wrong
pockets. Guess they should have employed a public relations
outfit. Jamaica looks small on the map, and I guess
the syndicates thought they could hurry through a neat
little operation like the Nassau job. But the opposition
party got wise, and the Church, and the old women, and
there was talk of the Mafia taking over in Jamaica, the
old Cosa Nostra and all that crap, and the boys lost out.
Remember we were offered an in coupla years back?
That was when they saw it was a bust and wanted to
unload their promotion expenses, coupla million bucks
or so, onto The Group. You recall I advised against and
gave my reasons. Okay. So we said no. But things have
changed. Different party in power, bit of a tourist slump
last year, and a certain minister has been in touch with
me. Says the climate’s changed. Independence has come
along, and they’ve got out from behind the skirts of
Aunty England. Want to show that Jamaica’s with it.
Got oomph and all that. So this friend of mine says he
can get gambling off the pad here. He told me how and
it makes sense. Before, I said stay out. Now I say come in.
But it’s going to cost money. Each of us’ll have to chip in
with a hundred thousand bucks to give local encouragement.
Miami’ll be the operators and get the franchise.
The deal is that they’ll put us in for five percent—but off
the top. Get me? On these figures, and they’re not
loaded, our juice should have been earned in eighteen
months. After that it’s gravy. Get the picture? But your,
er, friends, don’t seem too keen on these, er, capitalist
enterprises. How do you figure it? Will they ante up? I
don’t want for us to go outside for the green. And, as
from yesterday, we’re missing a shareholder. Come to
think of it, we’ve got to think of that too. Who we goin’
to rope in as Number Seven? We’re short of a game for
now.”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond wiped his ear and the bottom of the glass
with his handkerchief. It was almost unbearable. He had
heard his own death sentence pronounced, the involvement
of the K.G.B. with Scaramanga and the Caribbean
spelled out, and such minor dividends as sabotage of the
bauxite industry, massive drug smuggling into the
States, and gambling politics thrown in. It was a majestic
haul in area Intelligence. He had the ball! Could he live
to touch down with it? God, for a drink! He put his ear
back to the hot base of the glass.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was silence. When it came, the voice of Hendriks
was cautious, indecisive. He obviously wanted to
say “I pass”—with the corollary, “until I’ve talked to my
Zentrale, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">He said, “Mister S. Is difficult pizzness, yes? My superiors
are not disliking the profitable involvements, but,
as you will be knowing, they are most liking the pizzness
that has the political objective. It was on these conditions
that they instructed me to ally myself with your
Group. The money, that is not the problem. But how
am I to explain the political objective of opening casinos
in Jamaica? This I am wondering.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It’ll almost certainly lead to trouble. The locals’ll
want to play—they’re terrific gamblers here. There’ll be
incidents. The natives will be turned away from the
doors for one reason or another. Then the opposition
party’ll get hold of that and raise hell about colour bars
and so on. With all the money flying about, the unions’ll
push wages through the roof. It can all add up to a fine
stink. The atmosphere’s too damn peaceful around here.
This’ll be a cheap way of raising plenty of hell. That’s
what your people want, isn’t it? Give the islands the hot
foot one after another?”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was another brief silence. Mr. Hendriks obviously
didn’t like the idea. He said so, but obliquely:
“What you are saying, Mister S., is very interesting. But
is it not that these troubles you envisage will endanger
our monies? However, I will report your inquiry and inform
you at once. It is possible that my superiors will be
sympathetic. Who can be telling? Now there is this question
of a new Number Seven. Are you having anyone in
mind?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I think we want a good man from South America.
We need a guy to oversee our operations in British
Guiana. We oughta get smartened up in Venezuela.
How come we never got further with that great scheme
for blocking the Maracaibo strait? Like robbing a blind
man, given a suitable block ship. Just the threat of it
would make the oil companies shell out—that’s a joke by
the way—and go on shelling by way of protection. Then,
if this narcotics spiel is going to be important, we can’t
do without Mexico. How about Mr. Arosio of Mexico
City?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I am not knowing this gentleman.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Rosy? Oh, he’s a great guy. Runs the Green Light
Transportation System. Drugs and girls into L.A. Never
been caught yet. Reliable operator. Got no affiliates.
Your people’ll know about him. Why not check with
them, and then we’ll put it up to the others. They’ll
go along with our say-so.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Is good. And now, Mister S. Have you anything to
report about your own employer? On his recent visit to
Moscow, I understand that he expressed satisfaction with
your efforts in this area. It is a matter for gratification
that there should be such close cooperation between his
subversive efforts and our own. Both our chiefs are expecting
much in the future from our union with the
Mafia. Myself I am doubting. Mr. Gengerella is undoubtedly
a valuable link, but it is my impression that
these people are only being activated by money. What is
it that you are thinking?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You’ve said it, Mr. Hendriks. In the opinion of my
chief, the Mafia’s first and only consideration is the Mafia.
It has always been so and it always will be so. My
Mister C. is not expecting great results in the States. Even
the Mafia can’t buck the anti-Cuban feeling there. But
he thinks we can achieve plenty in the Caribbean by giving
them odd jobs to do. They can be very effective. It
would certainly oil the wheels if your people would use
the Mafia as a pipeline for this narcotics business.
They’ll turn your million-dollar investment into ten.
They’ll grab the nine out of it, of course. But that’s not
peanuts, and it’ll tie them in to you. Think you could
arrange that? It’ll give Leroy G. some good news to report
when he gets home. As for Mister C., he seems to be
going along all right. Flora was a body-blow, but, largely
thanks to the Americans leaning on Cuba the way they
do, he’s kept the country together. If the Americans once
let up on their propaganda and needling and so forth,
perhaps even make a friendly gesture or two, all the
steam’ll go out of the little man. I don’t often see him.
He leaves me alone. Likes to keep his nose clean, I guess.
But I get all the cooperation I need from the D.S.S.
Okay? Well let’s go see if the folks are ready to move. It’s
eleven-thirty and the Belle of Bloody Bay is due to be on
her way at twelve. Guess it’s going to be quite a fun day.
Pity our chiefs aren’t going to be along to see the limey
eye get his chips.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Ha!” said Mr. Hendriks noncommittally.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond moved away from the door. He heard
Scaramanga’s passkey in the lock. He looked up and
yawned.</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga and Mr. Hendriks looked down at him.
Their expressions were vaguely interested and reflective.
It was as if he were a bit of steak and they were wondering
whether to have it done rare or medium rare.</p>
