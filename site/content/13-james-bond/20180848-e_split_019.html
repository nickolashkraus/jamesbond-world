<p class="line9">James Bond leaped for the accelerator lever and tore it
downwards. The engine lost a head of steam, but there
was only a hundred yards to go. Now the only thing that
could save the girl were the brakes under Scaramanga’s
control in the brake van. The Rasta already had his cutlass
in his hand. The flames from the furnace glinted on
the blade. He stood back like a cornered animal, his eyes
red with ganja and fear of the gun in Bond’s hand.
Nothing could save the girl now! Bond, knowing that
Scaramanga would expect him from the right side of the
tender, leaped to the left. Hendriks had his gun out. Before
it could swivel, Bond put a bullet between the
man’s cold eyes. The head jerked back. For an instant,
steel-capped back teeth showed in the gaping mouth.
Then the grey Homburg fell off and the dead head
slumped. The golden gun boomed twice. A bullet
whanged round the cabin. The Rasta screamed and fell
to the ground, clutching at his throat. His hand was still
clenched round the whistle lanyard, and the little train
kept up its mournful howl of warning. Fifty yards to go!
The golden hair hung forlornly forward, obscuring the
face. The ropes on the wrists and ankles showed clearly.
The breasts offered themselves to the screaming engine.
Bond ground his teeth and shut his mind to the dreadful
impact that would come any minute now. He leaped to
the left again and got off three shots. He thought two of
them had hit, but then something slammed a great blow
into the muscle of his left shoulder and he spun across
the cab and crashed to the iron floor, his face over the
edge of the footplate. And it was from there, only inches
away, that he saw the front wheels scrunch through the
body on the line, saw the blonde head severed from the
body, saw the china-blue eyes give him a last blank stare,
saw the fragments of the showroom dummy disintegrate
with a sharp crackling of plastic and the pink splinters
shower down the embankment.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond choked back the sickness that rose from
his stomach into the back of his throat. He staggered to
his feet, keeping low. He reached up for the accelerator
lever and pushed it upwards. A pitched battle with the
train at a standstill would put the odds even more
against him. He hardly felt the pain in his shoulder. He
edged round the right-hand side of the tender. Four
guns boomed. He flung his head back under cover. Now
the hoods were shooting, but wildly because of the interference
of the surrey top. But Bond had had time to see
one glorious sight. In the brake van, Scaramanga had
slid from his throne and was down on his knees, his head
moving to and fro like a wounded animal. Where in hell
had Bond hit him? And now what? How was he going to
deal with the four hoods, just as badly obscured from
him as he was from them?</p>

<p class="pindent">Then a voice from the back of the train—it could only
be from the brake van—Felix Leiter’s voice—called out
above the shriek of the engine’s whistle, “Okay, you four
guys. Toss your guns over the side. Now! Quick!” There
came the crack of a shot. “I said quick. There’s Mr. Gengerella
gone to meet his maker. Okay, then. And now
hands behind your heads. That’s better. Right. Okay,
James. The battle’s over. Are you okay? If so, show yourself.
There’s still the final curtain, and we’ve got to move
quick.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond rose carefully. He could hardly believe it! Leiter
must have been riding on the buffers behind the brake
van. He wouldn’t have been able to show himself earlier
for fear of Bond’s gunfire. Yes! There he was! His fair
hair tousled by the wind, a long-barrelled pistol using
his upraised steel hook as a rest, standing astride the now
supine body of Scaramanga beside the brake wheel.
Bond’s shoulder had begun to hurt like hell. He
shouted, with the anger of tremendous relief, “Goddamn
you, Leiter. Why in hell didn’t you show up before?
I might have got hurt.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter laughed. “That’ll be the day! Now listen,
shamus. Get ready to jump. The longer you wait, the
farther you’ve got to walk home. I’m going to stay with
these guys for a while and hand them over to the law in
Green Island.” He shook his head to show this was a lie.
“Now get goin’. It’s The Morass. The landing’ll be soft.
Stinks a bit, but we’ll give you an eau-de-cologne spray
when you get home. Right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The train ran over a small culvert, and the song of the
wheels changed to a deep boom. Bond looked ahead. In
the distance was the spidery ironwork of the Orange
River bridge. The still shrieking train was losing steam.
The gauge said nineteen miles per hour. Bond looked
down at the dead Rasta. In death, his face was as horrible
as it had been in life. The bad teeth, sharpened from
eating sugar cane from childhood, were bared in a frozen
snarl. Bond took a quick glance under the surrey roof.
Hendriks’ slumped body lolled with the movement of
the train. The sweat of the day still shone on the doughy
cheeks. Even as a corpse he didn’t ask for sympathy. In
the seat behind him, Leiter’s bullet had torn through
the back of Gengerella’s head and removed most of his
face. The three gangsters now gazed up at James Bond
with whipped eyes. They hadn’t expected all this. This
was to have been a holiday. The calypso shirts said so.
Pistols Scaramanga, the undefeated, the undefeatable,
had said so. Until minutes before, his golden gun had
backed up his word. Now, suddenly, everything was different.
As the Arabs say when a great sheikh has gone,
has removed his protection, “Now there is no more
shade!” They were covered with guns from the front and
the rear. The train stretched out its iron stride towards
nowhere they had ever heard of before. The whistle
moaned. The sun beat down. The dreadful stink of The
Great Morass assailed their nostrils. This was abroad.
This was bad news, really bad. The Tour Director had
left them to fend for themselves. Two of them had been
killed. Even their guns were gone. The tough faces, as
white moons, gazed in supplication up at Bond. Louie
Paradise’s voice was cracked and dry with terror. “A million
bucks, mister, if you get us out of this. Swear on
my mother. A million.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The faces of Sam Binion and Hal Garfinkel lit up.
Here was hope!</p>

<p class="pindent">“And a million.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“And another! On my baby son’s head!”</p>

<p class="pindent">The voice of Felix Leiter bellowed angrily. There was
a note of panic in it. “Jump. Damn you, James! Jump!”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond stood up in the cabin, not listening to the
voices supplicating from under the yellow surrey roof.
These men had wanted to watch him being murdered.
They had been prepared to murder him themselves.
How many dead men had each one of them got on his
tally sheet? Bond got down on the step of the cabin,
chose his moment, and threw himself clear of the clinker
track and into the soft embraces of a stinking mangrove
pool.</p>

<p class="pindent">His explosion into the mud released the stench of hell.
Great bubbles of marsh gas wobbled up to the surface
and burst glutinously. A bird screeched and clattered off
through the foliage. James Bond waded out onto the
edge of the embankment. Now his shoulder was really
hurting. He knelt down and was as sick as a cat.</p>

<p class="pindent">When he raised his head, it was to see Leiter hurl himself
off the brake van, now a good two hundred yards
away. He seemed to land clumsily. He didn’t get up.
And now, within yards of the long iron bridge over the
sluggish river, another figure leaped from the train into
a clump of mangrove. It was a tall, chocolate-clad figure.
There was no doubt about it! It was Scaramanga! Bond
cursed feebly. Why in hell hadn’t Leiter put a finishing
bullet through the man’s head? Now there was unfinished
business. The cards had only been reshuffled. The
end game had still to be played!</p>

<p class="pindent">The screaming progress of the driverless train
changed to a roar as the track took to the trestles of the
long bridge. Bond watched it vaguely, wondering when
it would run out of steam. What would the three gangsters
do now? Take to the hills? Get the train under control
and go on to Green Harbour and try and take the
<span class="it">Thunder Bird</span> across to Cuba? Immediately the answer
came! Halfway across the bridge, the engine suddenly
reared up like a bucking stallion. At the same time there
came a crash of thunder and a vast sheet of flame, and
the bridge buckled downwards in the centre like a bent
leg. Chunks of torn iron sprayed upwards and sideways,
and there was a splintering crash as the main stanchions
gave and slowly bowed down towards the water.
Through the jagged gap, the beautiful Belle, a smashed
toy, folded upon itself and, with a giant splintering of
iron and woodwork and a volcano of spray and steam,
thundered into the river.</p>

<p class="pindent">A deafening silence fell. Somewhere behind Bond, a
wakened tree frog tinkled uncertainly. Four white egrets
flew down and over the wreck, their necks outstretched
inquisitively. In the distance, black dots materialized
high up in the sky and circled lazily closer. The sixth
sense of the turkey buzzards had told them that the distant
explosion was disaster—something that might yield
a meal. The sun hammered down on the silver rails, and
a few yards away from where Bond lay, a group of yellow
butterflies danced in the shimmer. Bond got slowly to
his feet, and parting the butterflies, began walking
slowly but purposefully up the line towards the bridge.
First Felix Leiter, and then after the big one that had
got away.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter lay in the stinking mud. His left leg was at a
hideous angle. Bond went down to him, his finger to his
lips. He knelt beside him and said softly, “Nothing
much I can do for now, pal. I’ll give you a bullet to bite
on and get you into some shade. There’ll be people coming
before long. Got to get on after that bastard. He’s
somewhere up there by the bridge. What made you
think he was dead?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter groaned, more in anger with himself than
from the pain. “There was blood all over the place.”
The voice was a halting whisper between clenched teeth.
“His shirt was soaked in it. Eyes closed. Thought if he
wasn’t cold he’d go with the others on the bridge.” He
smiled faintly. “How did you dig the River Kwai stunt?
Go off all right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond raised a thumb. “Fourth of July. The crocs’ll be
sitting down to table right now. But that damned
dummy! Gave me a nasty turn. Did you put her there?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sure. Sorry, boy. Mr. S. told me to. Made an excuse
to spike the bridge this morning. No idea your girl
friend was a blonde or that you’d fall for the spiel.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Bloody silly of me, I suppose. Thought he’d got hold
of her last night. Anyway, come on. Here’s your bullet.
Bite the lead. The story books say it helps. This is going
to hurt, but I must haul you under cover and out of the
sun.” Bond got his hands under Leiter’s armpits and, as
gently as he could, dragged him to a dry patch under a
big mangrove bush above swamp level. The sweat of
pain poured down Leiter’s face. Bond propped him up
against the roots. Leiter gave a groan and his head fell
back. Bond looked thoughtfully down at him. A faint
was probably the best thing that could have happened.
He took Leiter’s gun out of his waistband and put it beside
his left, and only, hand. Bond still might get into
much trouble. If he did, Scaramanga would come after
Felix.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond crept off along the line of mangroves towards
the bridge. For the time being, he would have to keep
more or less in the open. He prayed that, nearer the
river, the swamp would yield to drier land so that he
could work down towards the sea and then cut back towards
the river and hope to pick up the man’s tracks.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was one o’clock and the sun was high. James Bond
was tired and very thirsty, and his shoulder wound
throbbed with his pulse. The wound was beginning to
give him a fever. One dreams all day as well as all night,
and now, as he stalked his prey, he found, quizzically,
that much of his mind was taken up with visualizing the
champagne buffet waiting for them all, the living and
the dead, at Green Island. For the moment, he indulged
himself. The buffet would be laid out under the trees, as
he saw it, adjoining the terminal station, which would
probably be on the same lines as Thunderbird Halt.
There would be long trestle tables, spotless tablecloths,
rows of glasses and plates and cutlery, and great dishes of
cold lobster salad, cold meat cuts. And mounds of fruit—pineapple
and such—to make the décor look Jamaican
and exotic. There might be a hot dish, he thought.
Something like roast stuffed sucking-pig with rice and
peas—too hot for the day, decided Bond, but a feast for
most of Green Island when the rich “tourists” had departed.
And there would be drink! Champagne in
frosted silver coolers, rum punches, Tom Collinses,
whisky sours, and, of course, great beakers of iced water
that would only have been poured when the train whistled
its approach to the gay little station. Bond could see
it all. Every detail of it under the shade of the great ficus
trees. The white-gloved, uniformed coloured waiters enticing
him to take more and more; beyond, the dancing
waters of the harbour; in the background the hypnotic
throb of the calypso band, the soft, enticing eyes of the
girls. And, ruling, ordering all, the tall, fine figure of the
gracious host, a thin cigar between his teeth, the wide
white Stetson tilted low over his brow, offering Bond
just one more goblet of iced champagne.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond stumbled over a mangrove root, threw out
his right hand for support from the bush, missed, tripped
again, and fell heavily. He lay for a moment, measuring
the noise he must have made. It wouldn’t have
been much. The inshore wind from the sea was feathering
the swamp. A hundred yards away the river
added its undertone of sluggish turbulence. There were
cricket and bird noises. Bond got to his knees and then
to his feet. What in hell had he been thinking of? Come
on, you bloody fool! There’s work to be done! He shook
his head to clear it. Gracious host! Goddamn it! He was
on his way to kill the gracious host! Goblets of iced
champagne? That’d be the day! He shook his head angrily.
He took several very deep slow breaths. He knew
the symptoms. This was nothing worse than acute nervous
exhaustion with—he gave himself that amount of
grace—a small fever added. All he had to do was to keep
his mind and his eyes in focus. For God’s sake, no more
daydreaming! With a new, sharpened resolve he kicked
the mirages out of his mind and looked to his geography.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were perhaps a hundred yards to go to the
bridge. On Bond’s left, the mangroves were sparser and
the black mud was dry and cracked. But there were still
soft patches. Bond put up the collar of his coat to hide
the white shirt. He covered another twenty yards beside
the rail and then struck off left into the mangroves. He
found that if he kept close to the roots of the mangroves
the going wasn’t too bad. At least there were no dry
twigs or leaves to crack and rustle. He tried to keep as
nearly as possible parallel with the river, but thick
patches of bushes made him make small detours and he
had to estimate his direction by the dryness of the mud
and the slight rise of the land towards the riverbank. His
ears were pricked like an animal’s for the smallest sound.
His eyes strained into the greenery ahead. Now the mud
was pitted with the burrows of land crabs, and there
were occasional remnants of their shells, victims of big
birds or mongoose. For the first time, mosquitoes and
sandflies began to attack him. Fearing the noise, he
dared only to dab at them softly with his handkerchief
that was soon soaked with the blood they had sucked
from him and wringing with the white man’s sweat that
attracted them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond estimated that he had penetrated two hundred
yards into the swamp when he heard the single, controlled
cough.</p>
