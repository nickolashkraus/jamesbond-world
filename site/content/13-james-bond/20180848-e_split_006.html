<p class="line9">The Secret Service holds much that is kept secret even
from very senior officers in the organization. Only M.
and his Chief of Staff know absolutely everything there
is to know. The latter is responsible for keeping the Top
Secret record known as The War Book so that, in the
event of the death of both of them, the whole story,
apart from what is available to individual Sections and
Stations, would be available to their successors.</p>

<p class="pindent">One thing that James Bond, for instance, didn’t know
was the machinery at Headquarters for dealing with the
public, whether friendly or otherwise—drunks, lunatics,
bona fide applications to join the Service, and enemy
agents with plans for penetration or even assassination.</p>

<p class="pindent">On that cold, clear morning in November he was to
see the careful cogwheels in motion.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl at the switchboard at the Ministry of Defence
flicked the switch to <span class="calibre2">HOLD</span> and said to her neighbour,
“It’s another nut who says he’s James Bond. Even knows
his code number. Says he wants to speak to M. personally.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The senior girl shrugged. The switchboard had had
quite a few such calls since, a year before, James Bond’s
death on a mission to Japan had been announced in the
press. There had even been one pestiferous woman who,
at every full moon, passed on messages from Bond on
Uranus, where it seemed he had got stuck while awaiting
entry into heaven. She said, “Put him through to Liaison,
Pat.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The Liaison Section was the first cog in the machine,
the first sieve. The operator got back on the line: “Just a
moment, sir. I’ll put you on to an officer who may be
able to help you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond, sitting on the edge of his bed, said,
“Thank you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">He had expected some delay before he could establish
his identity. He had been warned to expect it by the
charming “Colonel Boris” who had been in charge of
him for the past few months after he had finished his
treatment in the luxurious Institute on the Nevsky Prospekt
in Leningrad. A man’s voice came on the line.
“Captain Walker speaking. Can I help you?”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond spoke slowly and clearly. “This is Commander
James Bond speaking. Number 007. Would you
put me through to M., or his secretary, Miss Moneypenny.
I want to make an appointment.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Captain Walker pressed two buttons on the side of his
telephone. One of them switched on a tape recorder for
the use of his department, the other alerted one of the
duty officers in the Action Room of the Special Branch
at Scotland Yard that he should listen to the conversation,
trace the call, and at once put a tail on the caller. It
was now up to Captain Walker, who was in fact an extremely
bright ex-prisoner-of-war interrogator from Military
Intelligence, to keep the subject talking for as near
five minutes as possible. He said, “I’m afraid I don’t
know either of these two people. Are you sure you’ve got
the right number?”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond patiently repeated the Regent number
which was the main outside line for the Secret Service.
Together with so much else, he had forgotten it, but
Colonel Boris had known it and had made him write it
down among the small print on the front page of his
forged British passport that said his name was Frank
Westmacott, company director.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes,” said Captain Walker sympathetically. “We
seem to have got that part of it right. But I’m afraid I
can’t place these people you want to talk to. Who exactly
are they? This Mr. Em, for instance. I don’t think we’ve
got anyone of that name at the Ministry.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Do you want me to spell it out? You realize this is an
open line?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Captain Walker was rather impressed by the confidence
in the speaker’s voice. He pressed another button,
and, so that Bond would hear it, a telephone bell rang.
He said, “Hang on a moment, would you? There’s someone
on my other line.” Captain Walker got on to the
head of his Section. “Sorry, sir. I’ve got a chap on who
says he’s James Bond and wants to talk to M. I know it
sounds crazy and I’ve gone through the usual motions
with the Special Branch and so on, but would you mind
listening for a minute? Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Two rooms away a harassed man, who was the Chief
Security Officer for the Secret Service, said “Blast!” and
pressed a switch. A microphone on his desk came to life.
The Chief Security Officer sat very still. He badly
needed a cigarette, but his room was now live to Captain
Walker and to the lunatic who called himself “James
Bond.” Captain Walker’s voice came over at full
strength. “I’m so sorry. Now then. This man Mr. Em
you want to talk to. I’m sure we needn’t worry about
security. Could you be more specific?”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond frowned. He didn’t know that he had
frowned, and he wouldn’t have been able to explain why
he had done so. He said, and lowered his voice, again
inexplicably, “Admiral Sir Miles Messervy. He is head of
a department in your Ministry. The number of his room
used to be twelve on the eighth floor. He used to have a
secretary called Miss Moneypenny. Good-looking girl.
Brunette. Shall I give you the Chief of Staff’s name? No?
Well, let’s see, it’s Wednesday. Shall I tell you what’ll be
the main dish on the menu in the canteen? It should be
steak-and-kidney pudding.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The Chief Security Officer picked up the direct telephone
to Captain Walker. Captain Walker said to James
Bond, “Damn! There’s the other telephone again.
Shan’t be a minute.” He picked up the green telephone.
“Yes, sir?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I don’t like that bit about the steak-and-kidney pudding.
Pass him on to the Hard Man. No. Cancel that.
Make it the Soft. There was always something odd about
007’s death. No body. No solid evidence. And the people
on that Japanese island always seemed to me to be playing
it pretty close to the chest. The stone-face act. It’s
just possible. Keep me informed, would you?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Captain Walker got back to James Bond. “Sorry about
that. It’s being a busy day. Now then, this inquiry of
yours. Afraid I can’t help you myself. Not my part of the
Ministry. The man you want is Major Townsend. He
should be able to locate this man you want to see. Got a
pencil? It’s number forty-four Kensington Cloisters. Got
that? Kensington double five double five. Give me ten
minutes and I’ll have a word with him and see if he can
help. All right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond said dully, “That’s very kind of you.” He
put down the telephone. He waited exactly ten minutes
and picked up the receiver and asked for the number.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond was staying at the Ritz Hotel. Colonel
Boris had told him to do so. Bond’s file in the K.G.B.
Archive described him as a high-liver, so, on arrival in
London, he must stick to the K.G.B. image of the high
life. Bond went down in the lift to the Arlington Street
entrance. A man at the newsstand got a good profile of
him with a buttonhole Minox. When Bond went down
the shallow steps to the street and asked the commissionaire
for a taxi, a Canonflex with a telescopic lens clicked
away busily from a Red Roses laundry van at the neighbouring
goods entrance, and in due course the same van
followed Bond’s taxi while a man inside the van reported
briefly to the Action Room of the Special Branch.</p>

<p class="pindent">Number forty-four Kensington Cloisters was a dull
Victorian mansion in grimy red brick. It had been
chosen for its purpose because it had once been the
headquarters of the Empire League for Noise Abatement,
and its entrance still bore the brass plate of this
long-defunct organization, the empty shell of which had
been purchased by the Secret Service through the Commonwealth
Relations Office. It also had a spacious old-fashioned
basement, re-equipped as detention cells, and
a rear exit into a quiet mews.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Red Roses laundry van watched the front door
shut behind James Bond and then moved off at a sedate
speed to its garage not far from Scotland Yard while the
process of developing the Canonflex film went on in its
interior.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Appointment with Major Townsend,” said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes. He’s expecting you, sir. Shall I take your raincoat?”
The powerful-looking doorman put the coat on a
coat hanger and hung it up on one of a row of hooks
beside the door. As soon as Bond was safely closeted with
Major Townsend, the coat would go swiftly to the laboratory
on the first floor where its provenance would be
established from an examination of the fabric. Pocket
dust would be removed for more leisurely research.
“Would you follow me, sir?”</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a narrow corridor of freshly painted clapboard
with a tall, single window which concealed the fluoroscope
triggered automatically from beneath the ugly
patterned carpet. The findings of its X-ray eye would be
fed into the laboratory above the passage. The passage
ended in two facing doors marked “A” and “B.” The
doorman knocked on Room B and stood aside for Bond
to enter.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a pleasant, very light room, close-carpeted in
dove-grey Wilton. The military prints on the cream
walls were expensively framed. A small, bright fire
burned under an Adam mantelpiece, which bore a number
of silver trophies and two photographs in leather
frames—one of a nice-looking woman and the other of
three nice-looking children. There was a central table
with a bowl of flowers and two comfortable club chairs
on either side of the fire. No desk or filing cabinets,
nothing official-looking. A tall man, as pleasant as the
room, got up from the far chair, dropped <span class="it">The Times</span> on
the carpet beside it, and came forward with a welcoming
smile. He held out a firm, dry hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">This was the Soft Man.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Come in. Come in. Take a pew. Cigarette? Not the
ones I seem to remember you favour. Just the good old
Senior Service.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Major Townsend had carefully prepared the loaded
remark—a reference to Bond’s liking for the Morland
Specials with the three gold rings. He noted Bond’s apparent
lack of comprehension. Bond took a cigarette and
accepted a light. They sat down facing one another. Major
Townsend crossed his legs comfortably. Bond sat up
straight. Major Townsend said, “Well now. How can I
help you?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Across the corridor, in Room A—a cold Office of
Works cube, equipped only with a hissing gas fire, an
ugly desk under a naked neon light, and two wooden
chairs—Bond’s reception by the Hard Man, an ex-police
superintendent (“ex” because of a brutality case in
Glasgow for which he had taken the rap), would have
been very different. There, the man who went under the
name of Mr. Robson would have given him the full intimidation
treatment—harsh, bullying interrogation,
threats of imprisonment for false representation, and
God knows what else, and, perhaps, if he had shown
signs of hostility or developing a nuisance value, a little
judicious roughing-up in the basement.</p>

<p class="pindent">Such was the ultimate sieve which sorted out the
wheat from the chaff from among those members of the
public who desired access to the Secret Service. There
were other people in the building who dealt with the
letters. Those written in pencil or in multicoloured
inks, and those enclosing a photograph, remained unanswered.
Those which threatened or were litigious were
referred to the Special Branch. The solid, serious ones
were passed, with a comment from the best graphologist
in the business, to the Liaison Section at Headquarters
for “further action.” Parcels went automatically, and
fast, to the Bomb Disposal Squad at Knightsbridge Barracks.
The eye of the needle was narrow. On the whole,
it discriminated appropriately. It was an expensive
setup, but it is the first duty of a secret service to remain
not only secret but secure.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was no reason why James Bond, who had always
been on the operative side of the business, should
know anything about the entrails of the Service, any
more than he should have understood the mysteries of
the plumbing or electricity supply of his flat in Chelsea
or the working of his own kidneys. Colonel Boris, however,
had known the whole routine. The secret services
of all the great powers know the public face of their opponents,
and Colonel Boris had very accurately described
the treatment that James Bond must expect before
he was cleared and was allowed access to the office
of his former chief.</p>

<p class="pindent">So now James Bond paused before he replied to Major
Townsend’s question about how he could be of help. He
looked at the Soft Man and then into the fire. He added
up the accuracy of the description he had been given of
Major Townsend’s appearance, and before he said what
he had been told to say, he gave Colonel Boris ninety out
of a hundred. The big, friendly face, the wide-apart, pale-brown
eyes, bracketed by the wrinkles of a million
smiles, the military moustache, the rimless monocle dangling
from a thin black cord, the brushed-back, thinning
sandy hair, the immaculate double-breasted blue suit,
stiff white collar and brigade tie—it was all there. But
what Colonel Boris hadn’t said was that the friendly eyes
were as cold and steady as gunbarrels and that the lips
were thin and scholarly.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond said patiently: “It’s really quite simple.
I’m who I say I am. I’m doing what I naturally would
do, and that’s report back to M.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Quite. But you must realize”—a sympathetic smile—“that
you’ve been out of contact for nearly a year.
You’ve been officially posted as ‘missing, believed killed.’
Your obituary has even appeared in <span class="it">The Times</span>. Have
you any evidence of identity? I admit that you look very
much like your photographs, but you must see that we
have to be very sure before we pass you on up the ladder.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“A Miss Mary Goodnight was my secretary. She’d recognize
me all right. So would dozens of other people at
H.Q.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Miss Goodnight’s been posted abroad. Can you give
me a brief description of H.Q., just the main geography?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond did so.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Right. Now, who was a Miss Maria Freudenstadt?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Was?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, she’s dead.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thought she wouldn’t last long. She was a double,
working for K.G.B. Section One Hundred controlled
her. I wouldn’t get any thanks for telling you any more.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Major Townsend had been primed with this very secret
top question. He had been given the answer, more
or less as Bond had put it. This was the clincher. This
<span class="it">had</span> to be James Bond. “Well, we’re getting on fine.
Now, it only remains to find out where you’ve come
from and where you’ve been all these months and I
won’t keep you any longer.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sorry. I can only tell that to M. personally.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I see.” Major Townsend put on a thoughtful expression.
“Well, just let me make a telephone call or two and
I’ll see what can be done.” He got to his feet. “Seen today’s
<span class="it">Times</span>?” He picked it up and handed it to Bond. It
had been specially treated to give good prints. Bond took
it. “Shan’t be long.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Major Townsend shut the door behind him and went
across the passage and through the door marked “A,”
where he knew that “Mr. Robson” would be alone.
“Sorry to bother you, Fred. Can I use your scrambler?”
The chunky man behind the desk grunted through the
stem of his pipe and remained bent over the midday
<span class="it">Evening Standard</span> racing news.</p>

<p class="pindent">Major Townsend picked up the green receiver and
was put through to the laboratory. “Major Townsend
speaking. Any comment?” He listened, carefully, said
thank you, and got through to the Chief Security Officer
at Headquarters. “Well, sir, I think it must be 007. Bit
thinner than his photographs. I’ll be giving you his
prints as soon as he’s gone. Wearing his usual rig—dark-blue
single-breasted suit, white shirt, thin black knitted
silk tie, black casuals—but they all look brand-new.
Raincoat bought yesterday from Burberry’s. Got the
Freudenstadt question right, but says he won’t say anything
about himself except to M. personally. But whoever
he is, I don’t like it much. He fluffed on his special
cigarettes. He’s got an odd sort of glazed, sort of faraway
look, and the ’scope shows that he’s carrying a gun in his
right-hand coat pocket—curious sort of contraption,
doesn’t seem to have got a butt to it. I’d say he’s a sick
man. I wouldn’t personally recommend that M. should
see him, but I wouldn’t know how we’re to get him to
talk unless he does.” He paused. “Very good, sir. I’ll stay
by the telephone. I’m on Mr. Robson’s extension.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was silence in the room. The two men didn’t
get on well together. Major Townsend gazed into the gas
fire, wondering about the man next door. The telephone
burred. “Yes, sir? Very good, sir. Would your secretary
send along a car from the pool? Thank you, sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was sitting in the same upright posture, <span class="it">The
Times</span> still unopened in his hand. Major Townsend said
cheerfully, “Well, that’s fixed. Message from M. that he’s
tremendously relieved you’re all right and he’ll be free
in about half an hour. Car should be here in ten minutes
or so. And the Chief of Staff says he hopes you’ll be free
for lunch afterwards.”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond smiled for the first time. It was a thin
smile which didn’t light up his eyes. He said, “That’s
very kind of him. Would you tell him I’m afraid I shan’t
be free.”</p>
