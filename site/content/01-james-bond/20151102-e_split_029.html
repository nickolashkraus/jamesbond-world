<p class="pindent">The <span class="it">patron</span> brought him the letter in the morning.</p>

<p class="pindent">He burst into Bond’s room holding the envelope in
front of him as if it was on fire.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There has been a terrible accident. Madame . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond hurled himself out of bed and through the bathroom,
but the communicating door was locked. He dashed
back and through his room and down the corridor past a
shrinking, terrified maid.</p>

<p class="pindent">Vesper’s door was open. The sunlight through the
shutters lit up the room. Only her black hair showed above
the sheet and her body under the bedclothes was straight
and moulded like a stone effigy on a tomb.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond fell on his knees beside her and drew back the
sheet.</p>

<p class="pindent">She was asleep. She must be. Her eyes were closed.
There was no change in the dear face. She was just as she
would look and yet, and yet she was so still, no movement,
no pulse, no breath. That was it. There was no breath.</p>

<p class="pindent">Later the <span class="it">patron</span> came and touched him on the shoulder.
He pointed at the empty glass on the table beside her.
There were white dregs in the bottom of it. It stood beside
her book and her cigarettes and matches and the small
pathetic litter of her mirror and lipstick and handkerchief.
And on the floor the empty bottle of sleeping-pills, the pills
Bond had seen in the bathroom that first evening.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond rose to his feet and shook himself. The <span class="it">patron</span> was
holding out the letter towards him. He took it.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Please notify the Commissaire,’ said Bond. ‘I will be
in my room when he wants me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He walked blindly away without a backward glance.</p>

<p class="pindent">He sat on the edge of his bed and gazed out of the window
at the peaceful sea. Then he stared dully at the envelope.
It was addressed simply in a large round hand ‘Pour
Lui’.</p>

<p class="pindent">The thought passed through Bond’s mind that she must
have left orders to be called early, so that it would not be he
who found her.</p>

<p class="pindent">He turned the envelope over. Not long ago it was her
warm tongue which had sealed the flap.</p>

<p class="pindent">He gave a sudden shrug and opened it.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was not long. After the first few words he read it
quickly, the breath coming harshly through his nostrils.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he threw it down on the bed as if it had been a
scorpion.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="pindent"><span class="sc">My darling James</span> [the letter opened],</p>

<p class="pindent">I love you with all my heart and while you read these words
I hope you still love me because, now, with these words, this is
the last moment that your love will last. So good-bye, my sweet
love, while we still love each other. Good-bye, my darling.</p>

<p class="pindent">I am an agent of the MWD. Yes, I am a double agent for the
Russians. I was taken on a year after the war and I have worked
for them ever since. I was in love with a Pole in the RAF. Until
you, I still was. You can find out who he was. He had two DSOs
and after the war he was trained by M and dropped back into
Poland. They caught him and by torturing him they found out a
lot and also about me. They came after me and told me he could
live if I would work for them. He knew nothing of this, but he was
allowed to write to me. The letter arrived on the fifteenth of each
month. I found I couldn’t stop. I couldn’t bear the idea of a fifteenth
coming round without his letter. It would mean that I had killed
him. I tried to give them as little as possible. You must believe
me about this. Then it came to you. I told them you had been given
this job at Royale, what your cover was and so on. That was why
they knew about you before you arrived and why they had time to
put the microphones in. They suspected Le Chiffre, but they didn’t
know what your assignment was except that it was something to do
with him. That was all I told them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then I was told not to stand behind you in the Casino and to
see that neither Mathis nor Leiter did. That was why the gunman
was nearly able to shoot you. Then I had to stage that kidnapping.
You may have wondered why I was so quiet in the night-club. They
didn’t hurt me because I was working for MWD.</p>

<p class="pindent">But when I found out what had been done to you, even though
it was Le Chiffre who did it and he turned out to be a traitor, I
decided I couldn’t go on. By that time I had begun to fall in love
with you. They wanted me to find out things from you while you
were recovering, but I refused. I was controlled from Paris. I
had to ring up an Invalides number twice a day. They threatened
me, and finally they withdrew my control and I knew my lover in
Poland would have to die. But they were afraid I would talk, I
suppose, and I got a final warning that <span class="sc">smersh</span> would come for
me if I didn’t obey them. I took no notice. I was in love with you.
Then I saw the man with the black patch in the Splendide and I
found he had been making inquiries about my movements. This
was the day before we came down here. I hoped I could shake him
off. I decided that we would have an affair and I would escape to
South America from Le Havre. I hoped I would have a baby of
yours and be able to start again somewhere. But they followed us.
You can’t get away from them.</p>

<p class="pindent">I knew it would be the end of our love if I told you. I realized that
I could either wait to be killed by <span class="sc">smersh</span>, would perhaps get you
killed too, or I could kill myself.</p>

<p class="pindent">There it is, my darling love. You can’t stop me calling you that
or saying that I love you. I am taking that with me and the memories
of you.</p>

<p class="pindent">I can’t tell you much to help you. The Paris number was Invalides
55200. I never met any of them in London. Everything was done
through an accommodation address, a newsagent’s at 450 Charing
Cross Place.</p>

<p class="pindent">At our first dinner together you talked about that man in Yugoslavia
who was found guilty of treason. He said: ‘I was carried
away by the gale of the world.’ That’s my only excuse. That, and
for love of the man whose life I tried to save.</p>

<p class="pindent">It’s late now and I’m tired, and you’re just through two doors.
But I’ve got to be brave. You might save my life, but I couldn’t
bear the look in your dear eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">My love, my love.</p>

<p class="line5">V.</p>

</div>

<p class="pindent">Bond threw the letter down. Mechanically he brushed
his fingers together. Suddenly he banged his temples with
his fists and stood up. For a moment he looked out towards
the quiet sea, then he cursed aloud, one harsh obscenity.</p>

<p class="pindent">His eyes were wet and he dried them.</p>

<p class="pindent">He pulled on a shirt and trousers and with a set cold face
he walked down and shut himself in the telephone booth.</p>

<p class="pindent">While he was getting through to London, he calmly
reviewed the facts of Vesper’s letter. They all fitted. The
little shadows and question-marks of the past four weeks,
which his instinct had noted but his mind rejected, all stood
out now like signposts.</p>

<p class="pindent">He saw her now only as a spy. Their love and his grief
were relegated to the boxroom of his mind. Later, perhaps
they would be dragged out, dispassionately examined, and
then bitterly thrust back with other sentimental baggage
he would rather forget. Now he could only think of her
treachery to the Service and to her country and of the
damage it had done. His professional mind was completely
absorbed with the consequences—the covers which must
have been blown over the years, the codes which the enemy
must have broken, the secrets which must have leaked from
the centre of the very section devoted to penetrating the
Soviet Union.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was ghastly. God knew how the mess would be cleared
up.</p>

<p class="pindent">He ground his teeth. Suddenly Mathis’s words came
back to him: ‘There are plenty of really black targets
around,’ and, earlier, ‘What about <span class="sc">smersh</span>? I don’t like
the idea of these chaps running around France killing anyone
they feel has been a traitor to their precious political
system.’</p>

<p class="pindent">How soon Mathis had been proved right and how soon
his own little sophistries had been exploded in his face!</p>

<p class="pindent">While he, Bond, had been playing Red Indians through
the years (yes, Le Chiffre’s description was perfectly accurate),
the real enemy had been working quietly, coldly,
without heroics, right there at his elbow.</p>

<p class="pindent">He suddenly had a vision of Vesper walking down a
corridor with documents in her hand. On a tray. They
just got it on a tray while the cool secret agent with a
Double O number was gallivanting round the world—playing
Red Indians.</p>

<p class="pindent">His fingernails dug into the palms of his hands and his
body sweated with shame.</p>

<p class="pindent">Well, it was not too late. Here was a target for him, right
to hand. He would take on <span class="sc">smersh</span> and hunt it down.
Without <span class="sc">smersh</span>, without this cold weapon of death and
revenge, the MWD would be just another bunch of civil
servant spies, no better and no worse than any of the
western services.</p>

<p class="pindent"><span class="sc">Smersh</span> was the spur. Be faithful, spy well, or you die.
Inevitably and without any question, you will be hunted
down and killed.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was the same with the whole Russian machine. Fear
was the impulse. For them it was always safer to advance
than to retreat. Advance against the enemy and the bullet
might miss you. Retreat, evade, betray, and the bullet
would never miss.</p>

<p class="pindent">But now he would attack the arm that held the whip and
the gun. The business of espionage could be left to the
white-collar boys. They could spy, and catch the spies.
He would go after the threat behind the spies, the threat
that made them spy.</p>

<p class="pindent">The telephone rang and Bond snatched up the receiver.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was on to ‘the Link’, the outside liaison officer who
was the only man in London he might telephone from
abroad. Then only in dire necessity.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘This is 007 speaking. This is an open line. It’s an emergency.
Can you hear me? Pass this on at once. 3030 was a
double, working for Redland.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, dammit, I said “was”. The bitch is dead now.’</p>
