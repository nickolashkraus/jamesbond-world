<p class="pindent">Bond sat silent, frozen with defeat. He opened his
wide black case and took out a cigarette. He snapped
open the tiny jaws of the Ronson and lit the cigarette and
put the lighter back on the table. He took a deep lungful
of smoke and expelled it between his teeth with a faint hiss.</p>

<p class="pindent">What now? Back to the hotel and bed, avoiding the
commiserating eyes of Mathis and Leiter and Vesper. Back
to the telephone call to London, and then tomorrow the
plane home, the taxi up to Regent’s Park, the walk up
the stairs and along the corridor, and M’s cold face across
the table, his forced sympathy, his ‘better luck next time’
and, of course, there couldn’t be one, not another chance
like this.</p>

<p class="pindent">He looked round the table and up at the spectators. Few
were looking at him. They were waiting while the croupier
counted the money and piled up the chips in a neat stack in
front of the banker, waiting to see if anyone would conceivably
challenge this huge bank of thirty-two million
francs, this wonderful run of banker’s luck.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter had vanished, not wishing to look Bond in the eye
after the knock-out, he supposed. Yet Vesper looked
curiously unmoved, she gave him a smile of encouragement.
But then, Bond reflected, she knew nothing of the
game. Had no notion, probably, of the bitterness of his
defeat.</p>

<p class="pindent">The <span class="it">huissier</span> was coming towards Bond inside the rail. He
stopped beside him. Bent over him. Placed a squat envelope
beside Bond on the table. It was as thick as a dictionary.
Said something about the <span class="it">caisse</span>. Moved away again.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s heart thumped. He took the heavy anonymous
envelope below the level of the table and slit it open with his
thumbnail, noticing that the gum was still wet on the flap.</p>

<p class="pindent">Unbelieving and yet knowing it was true, he felt the
broad wads of notes. He slipped them into his pockets,
retaining the half-sheet of note-paper which was pinned to
the topmost of them. He glanced at it in the shadow below
the table. There was one line of writing in ink: ‘Marshall
Aid. Thirty-two million francs. With the compliments of
the USA.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond swallowed. He looked over towards Vesper. Felix
Leiter was again standing beside her. He grinned slightly
and Bond smiled back and raised his hand from the table in
a small gesture of benediction. Then he set his mind to
sweeping away all traces of the sense of complete defeat
which had swamped him a few minutes before. This was a
reprieve, but only a reprieve. There could be no more
miracles. This time he had to win—if Le Chiffre had not
already made his fifty million—if he was going to go on!</p>

<p class="pindent">The croupier had completed his task of computing the
<span class="it">cagnotte</span>, changing Bond’s notes into plaques and making a
pile of the giant stake in the middle of the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">There lay thirty-two thousand pounds. Perhaps, thought
Bond, Le Chiffre needed just one more coup, even a minor
one of a few million francs, to achieve his object. Then he
would have made his fifty million francs and would leave
the table. By tomorrow his deficits would be covered and
his position secure.</p>

<p class="pindent">He showed no signs of moving and Bond guessed with
relief that somehow he must have overestimated Le Chiffre’s
resources.</p>

<p class="pindent">The then only hope, thought Bond, was to stamp on him
now. Not to share the bank with the table, or to take some
minor part of it, but to go the whole hog. This would
really jolt Le Chiffre. He would hate to see more than ten
or fifteen million of the stake covered, and he could not
possibly expect anyone to banco the entire thirty-two
millions. He might not know that Bond had been cleaned
out, but he must imagine that Bond had by now only small
reserves. He could not know of the contents of the envelope;
if he did, he would probably withdraw the bank and start
all over again on the wearisome journey up from the five
hundred thousand franc opening bet.</p>

<p class="pindent">The analysis was right.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre needed another eight million.</p>

<p class="pindent">At last he nodded.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Un banco de trente-deux millions.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">The croupier’s voice rang out. A silence built itself up
round the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Un banco de trente-deux millions.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">In a louder, prouder voice the <span class="it">chef de partie</span> took up the
cry, hoping to draw big money away from the neighbouring
chemin-de-fer tables. Besides, this was wonderful
publicity. The stake had only once been reached in the
history of baccarat—at Deauville in 1950. The rival Casino
de la Forêt at Le Touquet had never got near it.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was then that Bond leant slightly forward.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Suivi</span>,’ he said quietly.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was an excited buzz round the table. The word
ran through the Casino. People crowded in. Thirty-two
million! For most of them it was more than they had earned
all their lives. It was their savings and the savings of their
families. It was, literally, a small fortune.</p>

<p class="pindent">One of the Casino directors consulted with the <span class="it">chef
de partie</span>. The <span class="it">chef de partie</span> turned apologetically to
Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Excusez moi, monsieur. La mise?</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">It was an indication that Bond really must show he had
the money to cover the bet. They knew, of course, that he
was a very wealthy man, but after all, thirty-two millions!
And it sometimes happened that desperate people would
bet without a sou in the world and cheerfully go to prison if
they lost.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Mes excuses, Monsieur Bond</span>,’ added the <span class="it">chef de partie</span>
obsequiously.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was when Bond shovelled the great wad of notes out
on to the table and the croupier busied himself with the task
of counting the pinned sheaves of ten thousand franc notes,
the largest denomination issued in France, that he caught a
swift exchange of glances between Le Chiffre and the gunman
standing directly behind Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">Immediately he felt something hard press into the base of
his spine, right into the cleft between his two buttocks on
the padded chair.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the same time a thick voice speaking southern French
said softly, urgently, just behind his right ear:</p>

<p class="pindent">‘This is a gun, monsieur. It is absolutely silent. It can
blow the base of your spine off without a sound. You will
appear to have fainted. I shall be gone. Withdraw your
bet before I count ten. If you call for help I shall fire.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The voice was confident. Bond believed it. These people
had shown they would unhesitatingly go the limit. The
thick walking-stick was explained. Bond knew the type of
gun. The barrel a series of soft rubber baffles which absorbed
the detonation, but allowed the passage of the bullet.
They had been invented and used in the war for assassinations,
Bond had tested them himself.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Un</span>,’ said the voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned his head. There was the man, leaning forward
close behind him, smiling broadly under his black
moustache as if he was wishing Bond luck, completely
secure in the noise and the crowd.</p>

<p class="pindent">The discoloured teeth came together. ‘<span class="it">Deux</span>,’ said the
grinning mouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked across. Le Chiffre was watching him. His
eyes glittered back at Bond. His mouth was open and he
was breathing fast. He was waiting, waiting for Bond’s hand
to gesture to the croupier, or else for Bond suddenly to
slump backwards in his chair, his face grimacing with a
scream.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Trois.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked over at Vesper and Felix Leiter. They were
smiling and talking to each other. The fools. Where was
Mathis? Where were those famous men of his?</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Quatre.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">And the other spectators. This crowd of jabbering
idiots. Couldn’t someone see what was happening? The
<span class="it">chef de partie</span>, the croupier, the <span class="it">huissier</span>?</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Cinq.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">The croupier was tidying up the pile of notes. The <span class="it">chef
de partie</span> bowed smilingly towards Bond. Directly the stake
was in order he would announce: ‘<span class="it">Le jeux est fait</span>.’ and the
gun would fire whether the gunman had reached ten or not.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Six.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond decided. It was a chance. He carefully moved his
hands to the edge of the table, gripped it, edged his
buttocks right back, feeling the sharp gun-sight grind into
his coccyx.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Sept.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">The <span class="it">chef de partie</span> turned to Le Chiffre with his eyebrows
lifted, waiting for the banker’s nod that he was ready to
play.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly Bond heaved backwards with all his strength.
His momentum tipped the cross-bar of the chair-back down
so quickly that it cracked across the malacca tube and
wrenched it from the gunman’s hand before he could pull
the trigger.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond went head-over-heels on to the ground amongst
the spectators’ feet, his legs in the air. The back of the chair
splintered with a sharp crack. There were cries of dismay.
The spectators cringed away and then, reassured, clustered
back. Hands helped him to his feet and brushed him down.
The <span class="it">huissier</span> bustled up with the <span class="it">chef de partie</span>. At all costs a
scandal must be avoided.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond held on to the brass rail. He looked confused and
embarrassed. He brushed his hands across his forehead.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A momentary faintness,’ he said. ‘It is nothing—the
excitement, the heat.’</p>

<p class="pindent">There were expressions of sympathy. Naturally, with
this tremendous game. Would Monsieur prefer to withdraw,
to lie down, to go home? Should a doctor be
fetched?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shook his head. He was perfectly all right now.
His excuses to the table. To the banker also.</p>

<p class="pindent">A new chair was brought and he sat down. He looked
across at Le Chiffre. Through his relief at being alive, he
felt a moment of triumph at what he saw—some fear in the
fat, pale face.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a buzz of speculation round the table. Bond’s
neighbours on both sides of him bent forward and spoke
solicitously about the heat and the lateness of the hour and
the smoke and the lack of air.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond replied politely. He turned to examine the crowd
behind him. There was no trace of the gunman, but the
<span class="it">huissier</span> was looking for someone to claim the malacca stick.
It seemed undamaged. But it no longer carried a rubber tip.
Bond beckoned to him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If you will give it to that gentleman over there,’ he
indicated Felix Leiter, ‘he will return it. It belongs to an
acquaintance of his.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The <span class="it">huissier</span> bowed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond grimly reflected that a short examination would
reveal to Leiter why he had made such an embarrassing
public display of himself.</p>

<p class="pindent">He turned back to the table and tapped the green cloth
in front of him to show that he was ready.</p>
