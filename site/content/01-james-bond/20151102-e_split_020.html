<p class="pindent">It was extraordinary to hear the third voice. The hour’s
ritual had only demanded a duologue against the horrible
noise of the torture. Bond’s dimmed senses hardly
took it in. Then suddenly he was half-way back to consciousness.
He found he could see and hear again. He could
hear the dead silence after the one quiet word from the
doorway. He could see Le Chiffre’s head slowly come up
and the expression of blank astonishment, of innocent
amazement, slowly give way to fear.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Shtop,’ had said the voice, quietly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond heard slow steps approaching behind his chair.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Dhrop it,’ said the voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond saw Le Chiffre’s hand open obediently and the
knife fall with a clatter to the floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">He tried desperately to read into Le Chiffre’s face what
was happening behind him, but all he saw was blind incomprehension
and terror. Le Chiffre’s mouth worked,
but only a high-pitched ‘eek’ came from it. His heavy
cheeks trembled as he tried to collect enough saliva in his
mouth to say something, ask something. His hands fluttered
vaguely in his lap. One of them made a slight
movement towards his pocket, but instantly fell back. His
round staring eyes had lowered for a split second and Bond
guessed there was a gun trained on him.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a moment’s silence.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="sc">Smersh.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">The word came almost with a sigh. It came with a downward
cadence as if nothing else had to be said. It was the
final explanation. The last word of all.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No,’ said Le Chiffre. ‘No. I . . .’ His voice tailed off.</p>

<p class="pindent">Perhaps he was going to explain, to apologize, but
what he must have seen in the other’s face made it all
useless.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Your two men. Both dead. You are a fool and a thief
and a traitor. I have been sent from the Soviet Union to
eliminate you. You are fortunate that I have only time to
shoot you. If it was possible, I was instructed that you
should die most painfully. We cannot see the end of the
trouble you have caused.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The thick voice stopped. There was silence in the room
save for the rasping breath of Le Chiffre.</p>

<p class="pindent">Somewhere outside a bird began to sing and there were
other small noises from the awakening countryside. The
bands of sunlight were stronger and the sweat on Le
Chiffre’s face glistened brightly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Do you plead guilty?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond wrestled with his consciousness. He screwed up his
eyes and tried to shake his head to clear it, but his whole
nervous system was numbed and no message was transmitted
to his muscles. He could just keep his focus on the
great pale face in front of him and on its bulging eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">A thin string of saliva crept from the open mouth and
hung down from the chin.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ said the mouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a sharp ‘phut’, no louder than a bubble of
air escaping from a tube of toothpaste. No other noise at
all, and suddenly Le Chiffre had grown another eye, a
third eye on a level with the other two, right where the
thick nose started to jut out below the forehead. It was a
small black eye, without eyelashes or eyebrows.</p>

<p class="pindent">For a second the three eyes looked out across the room
and then the whole face seemed to slip and go down on one
knee. The two outer eyes turned trembling up towards the
ceiling. Then the heavy head fell sideways and the right
shoulder and finally the whole upper part of the body
lurched over the arm of the chair as if Le Chiffre were
going to be sick. But there was only a short rattle of his
heels on the ground and then no other movement.</p>

<p class="pindent">The tall back of the chair looked impassively out across
the dead body in its arms.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a faint movement behind Bond. A hand
came from behind and grasped his chin and pulled it back.</p>

<p class="pindent">For a moment Bond looked up into two glittering eyes
behind a narrow black mask. There was the impression of
a crag-like face under a hat-brim, the collar of a fawn mackintosh.
He could take in nothing more before his head was
pushed down again.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You are fortunate,’ said the voice. ‘I have no orders
to kill you. Your life has been saved twice in one day.
But you can tell your organization that <span class="sc">smersh</span> is only
merciful by chance or by mistake. In your case you were
saved first by chance and now by mistake, for I should have
had orders to kill any foreign spies who were hanging
round this traitor like flies round a dog’s mess.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But I shall leave you my visiting-card. You are a gambler.
You play at cards. One day perhaps you will play against
one of us. It would be well that you should be known as a
spy.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Steps moved round to behind Bond’s right shoulder.
There was the click of a knife opening. An arm in some
grey material came into Bond’s line of vision. A broad
hairy hand emerging from a dirty white shirt-cuff was
holding a thin stiletto like a fountain-pen. It poised for a
moment above the back of Bond’s right hand, immovably
bound with flex to the arm of the chair. The point of the
stiletto executed three quick straight slashes. A fourth
slash crossed them where they ended, just short of the
knuckles. Blood in the shape of an inverted ‘M’ welled
out and slowly started to drip on to the floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">The pain was nothing to what Bond was already suffering,
but it was enough to plunge him again into unconsciousness.</p>

<p class="pindent">The steps moved quietly away across the room. The
door was softly closed.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the silence, the cheerful small sounds of the summer’s
day crept through the closed window. High on the left-hand
wall hung two small patches of pink light. They were
reflections cast upwards from the floor by the zebra stripes
of June sunshine, cast upwards from two separate pools of
blood a few feet apart.</p>

<p class="pindent">As the day progressed the pink patches marched slowly
along the wall. And slowly they grew larger.</p>
