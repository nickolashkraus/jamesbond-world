<p class="pindent">As Bond hurtled round the bend, caressing the great
car against the camber with an easy sway of body and
hands, he was working out his plan of action when the distance
between the two cars had narrowed still further. He
imagined that the enemy driver would try to dodge off into
a side-road if he got the chance. So when he got round the
bend and saw no lights ahead, it was a normal reflex to ease
up on the accelerator and, when he saw the Michelin post,
to prepare to brake.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was only doing about sixty as he approached the
black patch across the right-hand crown of the road which
he assumed to be the shadow cast by a wayside tree. Even
so, there was no time to save himself. There was suddenly
a small carpet of glinting steel spikes right under his off-side
wing. Then he was on top of it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond automatically slammed the brakes full on and
braced all his sinews against the wheel to correct the inevitable
slew to the left, but he only kept control for a split
second. As the rubber was flayed from his off-side wheels
and the rims for an instant tore up the tarmac, the heavy car
whirled across the road in a tearing dry skid, slammed the
left bank with a crash that knocked Bond out of the driving-seat
on to the floor, and then, facing back up the road, it
reared slowly up, its front wheels spinning and its great
headlights searching the sky. For a split second, resting on
the petrol tank, it seemed to paw at the heavens like a giant
praying-mantis. Then slowly it toppled over backwards
and fell with a splintering crash of coachwork and glass.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the deafening silence, the near-side front wheel
whispered briefly on and then squeaked to a stop.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre and his two men only had to walk a few yards
from their ambush.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Put your guns away and get him out,’ he ordered
brusquely. ‘I’ll keep you covered. Be careful of him. I
don’t want a corpse. And hurry up, it’s getting light.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The two men got down on their knees. One of them took
out a long knife and cut some of the fabric away from the
side of the convertible hood and took hold of Bond’s
shoulders. He was unconscious and immovable. The
other squeezed between the upturned car and the bank and
forced his way through the crumpled window-frame. He
eased Bond’s legs, pinned between the steering-wheel and
the fabric roof of the car. Then they inched him out through
a hole in the hood.</p>

<p class="pindent">They were sweating and filthy with dust and oil by the
time they had him lying in the road.</p>

<p class="pindent">The thin man felt his heart and then slapped his face hard
on either side. Bond grunted and moved a hand. The thin
man slapped him again.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s enough,’ said Le Chiffre. ‘Tie his arms and
put him in the car. Here,’ he threw a roll of flex to the
man. ‘Empty his pockets first and give me his gun. He
may have got some other weapons, but we can get them
later.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He took the objects the thin man handed him and stuffed
them and Bond’s Beretta into his wide pockets without
examining them. He left the men to it and walked back to
the car. His face showed neither pleasure nor excitement.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was the sharp bite of the wire flex into his wrists that
brought Bond to himself. He was aching all over as if he
had been thrashed with a wooden club, but when he was
yanked to his feet and pushed towards the narrow side-road
where the engine of the Citroën was already running
softly, he found that no bones were broken. But he felt in
no mood for desperate attempts to escape and allowed
himself to be dragged into the back seat of the car without
resisting.</p>

<p class="pindent">He felt thoroughly dispirited and weak in resolve as well
as in his body. He had had to take too much in the past
twenty-four hours and now this last stroke by the enemy
seemed almost too final. This time there could be no miracles.
No one knew where he was and no one would miss
him until well on into the morning. The wreck of his car
would be found before very long, but it would take hours
to trace the ownership to him.</p>

<p class="pindent">And Vesper. He looked to the right, past the thin man
who was lying back with his eyes closed. His first reaction
was one of scorn. Damn fool girl getting herself trussed up
like a chicken, having her skirt pulled over her head as if
the whole of this business was some kind of dormitory rag.
But then he felt sorry for her. Her naked legs looked so
childlike and defenceless.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Vesper,’ he said softly.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was no answer from the bundle in the corner and
Bond suddenly had a chill feeling, but then she stirred
slightly.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the same time the thin man caught him a hard back-handed
blow over the heart.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Silence.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond doubled over with the pain and to shield himself
from another blow, only to get a rabbit punch on the back
of the neck which made him arch back again, the breath
whistling through his teeth.</p>

<p class="pindent">The thin man had hit him a hard professional cutting
blow with the edge of the hand. There was something
rather deadly about his accuracy and lack of effort. He
was now again lying back, his eyes closed. He was a man
to make you afraid, an evil man. Bond hoped he might get
a chance of killing him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly the boot of the car was thrown open and there
was a clanking crash. Bond guessed that they had been
waiting for the third man to retrieve the carpet of spiked
chain-mail. He assumed it must be an adaptation of the
nail-studded devices used by the Resistance against German
staff-cars.</p>

<p class="pindent">Again he reflected on the efficiency of these people and
the ingenuity of the equipment they used. Had M underestimated
their resourcefulness? He stifled a desire to place
the blame on London. It was he who should have known;
he who should have been warned by small signs and taken
infinitely more precautions. He squirmed as he thought
of himself washing down champagne in the Roi Galant
while the enemy was busy preparing his counter-stroke.
He cursed himself and cursed the <span class="it">hubris</span> which had made
him so sure the battle was won and the enemy in flight.</p>

<p class="pindent">All this time Le Chiffre had said nothing. Directly the
boot was shut, the third man, whom Bond at once recognized,
climbed in beside him and Le Chiffre reversed furiously
back on to the main road. Then he banged the gear
lever through the gate and was soon doing seventy on
down the coast.</p>

<p class="pindent">By now it was dawn—about five o’clock, Bond guessed—and
he reflected that a mile or two on was the turning to
Le Chiffre’s villa. He had not thought that they would take
Vesper there. Now that he realized that Vesper had only
been a sprat to catch a mackerel the whole picture became
clear.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was an extremely unpleasant picture. For the first
time since his capture, fear came to Bond and crawled up
his spine.</p>

<p class="pindent">Ten minutes later the Citroën lurched to the left, ran on
a hundred yards up a small side-road partly overgrown
with grass and then between a pair of dilapidated stucco
pillars into an unkempt forecourt surrounded by a high wall.
They drew up in front of a peeling white door. Above a
rusty bell-push in the door-frame, small zinc letters on a
wooden base spelled out ‘Les Noctambules’ and, underneath,
‘Sonnez SVP’.</p>

<p class="pindent">From what Bond could see of the cement frontage, the
villa was typical of the French seaside style. He could
imagine the dead blue-bottles being hastily swept out for
the summer let and the stale rooms briefly aired by a cleaning
woman sent by the estate agent in Royale. Every five
years one coat of whitewash would be slapped over the
rooms and the outside woodwork, and for a few weeks the
villa would present a smiling front to the world. Then
the winter rains would get to work, and the imprisoned
flies, and quickly the villa would take on again its
abandoned look.</p>

<p class="pindent">But, Bond reflected, it would admirably serve Le
Chiffre’s purpose this morning, if he was right in assuming
what that was to be. They had passed no other house since
his capture and from his reconnaissance of the day before
he knew there was only an occasional farm for several miles
to the south.</p>

<p class="pindent">As he was urged out of the car with a sharp crack in the
ribs from the thin man’s elbow, he knew that Le Chiffre
could have them both to himself, undisturbed, for several
hours. Again his skin crawled.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre opened the door with a key and disappeared
inside. Vesper, looking incredibly indecent in the early
light of day, was pushed in after him with a torrent of lewd
French from the man whom Bond knew to himself as ‘the
Corsican’. Bond followed without giving the thin man a
chance to urge him.</p>

<p class="pindent">The key of the front door turned in the lock.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre was standing in the doorway of a room on the
right. He crooked a finger at Bond in a silent, spidery
summons.</p>

<p class="pindent">Vesper was being led down a passage towards the back of
the house. Bond suddenly decided.</p>

<p class="pindent">With a wild backward kick which connected with the
thin man’s shins and brought a whistle of pain from him he
hurled himself down the passage after her. With only his
feet as weapons, there was no plan in his mind except to do
as much damage as possible to the two gunmen and be able
to exchange a few hurried words with the girl. No other
plan was possible. He just wanted to tell her not to give
in.</p>

<p class="pindent">As the Corsican turned at the commotion Bond was on
him and his right shoe was launched in a flying kick at the
other man’s groin.</p>

<p class="pindent">Like lightning the Corsican slammed himself back
against the wall of the passage and, as Bond’s foot whistled
past his hip, he very quickly, but somehow delicately,
shot out his left hand, caught Bond’s shoe at the top of
its arch and twisted it sharply.</p>

<p class="pindent">Completely off balance, Bond’s other foot left the
ground. In the air his whole body turned and with the
momentum of his rush behind it crashed sideways and
down on to the floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">For a moment he lay there, all the breath knocked
out of him. Then the thin man came and hauled him up
against the wall by his collar. He had a gun in his hand.
He looked Bond inquisitively in the eyes. Then unhurriedly
he bent down and swiped the barrel viciously
across Bond’s shins. Bond grunted and caved at the
knees.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If there is a next time, it will be across your teeth,’ said
the thin man in bad French.</p>

<p class="pindent">A door slammed. Vesper and the Corsican had disappeared.
Bond turned his head to the right. Le Chiffre
had moved a few feet out into the passage. He lifted his
finger and crooked it again. Then for the first time he
spoke.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Come, my dear friend. We are wasting our time.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He spoke in English with no accent. His voice was low
and soft and unhurried. He showed no emotion. He might
have been a doctor summoning the next patient from the
waiting-room, a hysterical patient who had been expostulating
feebly with a nurse.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond again felt puny and impotent. Nobody but an
expert in ju-jitsu could have handled him with the Corsican’s
economy and lack of fuss. The cold precision with
which the thin man had paid him back in his own coin had
been equally unhurried, even artistic.</p>

<p class="pindent">Almost docilely Bond walked back down the passage.
He had nothing but a few more bruises to show for his
clumsy gesture of resistance to these people.</p>

<p class="pindent">As he preceded the thin man over the threshold he knew
that he was utterly and absolutely in their power.</p>
