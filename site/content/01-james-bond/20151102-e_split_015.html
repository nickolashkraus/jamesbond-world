<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">La partie continue</span>,’ announced the <span class="it">chef</span> impressively.
‘<span class="it">Un banco de trente-deux millions.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">The spectators craned forward. Le Chiffre hit the shoe
with a flat-handed slap that made it rattle. As an afterthought
he took out his benzedrine inhaler and sucked the
vapour up his nose.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Filthy brute,’ said Mrs Du Pont on Bond’s left.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s mind was clear again. By a miracle he had survived
a devastating wound. He could feel his armpits still
wet with the fear of it. But the success of his gambit with
the chair had wiped out all memories of the dreadful valley
of defeat through which he had just passed.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had made a fool of himself. The game had been interrupted
for at least ten minutes, a delay unheard of in a
respectable casino, but now the cards were waiting for him
in the shoe. They must not fail him. He felt his heart lift at
the prospect of what was to come.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was two o’clock in the morning. Apart from the thick
crowd round the big game, play was still going on at three
of the chemin-de-fer games and at the same number of
roulette tables.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the silence round his own table, Bond suddenly heard
a distant croupier intone: ‘<span class="it">Neuf. Le rouge gagne, impair et
manque.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">Was this an omen for him or for Le Chiffre?</p>

<p class="pindent">The two cards slithered towards him across the green
sea.</p>

<p class="pindent">Like an octopus under a rock, Le Chiffre watched him
from the other side of the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond reached out a steady right hand and drew the cards
towards him. Would it be the lift of the heart which a nine
brings, or an eight brings?</p>

<p class="pindent">He fanned the two cards under the curtain of his hand.
The muscles of his jaw rippled as he clenched his teeth.
His whole body stiffened in a reflex of self-defence.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had two queens, two red queens.</p>

<p class="pindent">They looked roguishly back at him from the shadows.
They were the worst. They were nothing. Zero. Baccarat.</p>

<p class="pindent">“A card,” said Bond fighting to keep hopelessness out of
his voice. He felt Le Chiffre’s eyes boring into his brain.</p>

<p class="pindent">The banker slowly turned his own two cards face up.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had a count of three—a king and a black three.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond softly exhaled a cloud of tobacco smoke. He still
had a chance. Now he was really faced with the moment
of truth. Le Chiffre slapped the shoe, slipped out a card,
Bond’s fate, and slowly turned it face up.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a nine, a wonderful nine of hearts, the card known
in gipsy magic as ‘a whisper of love, a whisper of hate’,
the card that meant almost certain victory for Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">The croupier slipped it delicately across. To Le Chiffre
it meant nothing. Bond might have had a one, in which
case he now had ten points, or nothing, or baccarat, as it is
called. Or he might have had a two, three, four, or even
five. In which case, with the nine, his maximum count
would be four.</p>

<p class="pindent">Holding a three and giving nine is one of the moot
situations at the game. The odds are so nearly divided
between to draw or not to draw. Bond let the banker sweat
it out. Since his nine could only be equalled by the banker
drawing a six, he would normally have shown his count if
it had been a friendly game.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s cards lay on the table before him, the two impersonal
pale pink-patterned backs and the faced nine of
hearts. To Le Chiffre the nine might be telling the truth
or many variations of lies.</p>

<p class="pindent">The whole secret lay in the reverse of the two pink
backs where the pair of queens kissed the green cloth.</p>

<p class="pindent">The sweat was running down either side of the banker’s
beaky nose. His thick tongue came out slyly and licked a
drop out of the corner of his red gash of a mouth. He
looked at Bond’s cards, and then at his own, and then back
at Bond’s.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then his whole body shrugged and he slipped out a
card for himself from the lisping shoe.</p>

<p class="pindent">He faced it. The table craned. It was a wonderful card, a
five.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Huit à la banque</span>,’ said the croupier.</p>

<p class="pindent">As Bond sat silent, Le Chiffre suddenly grinned
wolfishly. He must have won.</p>

<p class="pindent">The croupier’s spatula reached almost apologetically
across the table. There was not a man at the table who did
not believe Bond was defeated.</p>

<p class="pindent">The spatula flicked the two pink cards over on their
backs. The gay red queens smiled up at the lights.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Et le neuf.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">A great gasp went up round the table, and then a
hubbub of talk.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s eyes were on Le Chiffre. The big man fell back
in his chair as if slugged above the heart. His mouth
opened and shut once or twice in protest and his right hand
felt at his throat. Then he rocked back. His lips were grey.</p>

<p class="pindent">As the huge stack of plaques was shunted across the table
to Bond the banker reached into an inner pocket of his
jacket and threw a wad of notes on to the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">The croupier riffled through them.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Un banco de dix millions</span>,’ he announced. He slapped
down their equivalent in ten plaques of a million each.</p>

<p class="pindent">This is the kill, thought Bond. This man has reached the
point of no return. This is the last of his capital. He has
come to where I stood an hour ago and he is making the
last gesture that I made. But if this man loses, there is no
one to come to his aid, no miracle to help him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat back and lit a cigarette. On a small table beside
him half a bottle of Clicquot and a glass had materialized.
Without asking who the benefactor was, Bond filled the
glass to the brim and drank it down in two long draughts.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he leant back with his arms curled forward on the
table in front of him like the arms of a wrestler seeking a
hold at the opening of a bout of ju-jitsu.</p>

<p class="pindent">The players on his left remained silent.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Banco</span>,’ he said, speaking straight at Le Chiffre.</p>

<p class="pindent">Once more the two cards were borne over to him and
this time the croupier slipped them into the green lagoon
between the outstretched arms.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond curled his right hand in, glanced briefly down and
flipped the cards face up into the middle of the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Le Neuf</span>,’ said the croupier.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre was gazing down at his own two black kings.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Et le baccarat</span>,’ and the croupier eased across the table
the fat tide of plaques.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre watched them go to join the serried millions
in the shadow of Bond’s left arm, then he stood up slowly
and without a word he brushed past the players to the
break in the rail. He unhooked the velvet-covered chain
and let it fall. The spectators opened a way for him. They
looked at him curiously and rather fearfully as if he carried
the smell of death on him. Then he vanished from Bond’s
sight.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stood up. He took a hundred-mille plaque from
the stacks beside him and slipped it across the table to the
<span class="it">chef de partie</span>. He cut short the effusive thanks and asked the
croupier to have his winnings carried to the <span class="it">caisse</span>. The
other players were leaving their seats. With no banker,
there could be no game, and by now it was half past two.
He exchanged some pleasant words with his neighbours to
right and left and then ducked under the rail to where
Vesper and Felix Leiter were waiting for him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Together they walked over to the <span class="it">caisse</span>. Bond was invited
to come into the private office of the Casino directors.
On the desk lay his huge pile of chips. He added the contents
of his pockets to it.</p>

<p class="pindent">In all there was over seventy million francs.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took Felix Leiter’s money in notes and took a
cheque to cash on the Crédit Lyonnais for the remaining
forty-odd million. He was congratulated warmly on his
winnings. The directors hoped that he would be playing
again that evening.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gave an evasive reply. He walked over to the bar
and handed Leiter’s money to him. For a few minutes they
discussed the game over a bottle of champagne. Leiter
took a ·45 bullet out of his pocket and placed it on the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I gave the gun to Mathis,’ he said. ‘He’s taken it away.
He was as puzzled as we were by the spill you took. He
was standing at the back of the crowd with one of his men
when it happened. The gunman got away without difficulty.
You can imagine how they kicked themselves when
they saw the gun. Mathis gave me this bullet to show you
what you escaped. The nose has been cut with a dum-dum
cross. You’d have been in a terrible mess. But they
can’t tie it on to Le Chiffre. The man came in alone.
They’ve got the form he filled up to get his entrance card.
Of course, it’ll all be phony. He got permission to bring
the stick in with him. He had a certificate for a war-wound
pension. These people certainly get themselves well organized.
They’ve got his prints and they’re on the Belinograph
to Paris, so we may hear more about him in the morning.’
Felix Leiter tapped out another cigarette. ‘Anyway, all’s
well that ends well. You certainly took Le Chiffre for a
ride at the end, though we had some bad moments. I expect
you did too.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled. ‘That envelope was the most wonderful
thing that ever happened to me. I thought I was really
finished. It wasn’t at all a pleasant feeling. Talk about a
friend in need. One day I’ll try and return the compliment.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He rose. ‘I’ll just go over to the hotel and put this
away,’ he said, tapping his pocket. ‘I don’t like wandering
around with Le Chiffre’s death-warrant on me. He might
get ideas. Then I’d like to celebrate a bit. What do you
think?’</p>

<p class="pindent">He turned to Vesper. She had hardly said a word since
the end of the game.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Shall we have a glass of champagne in the night-club
before we go to bed? It’s called the Roi Galant. You get
to it through the public rooms. It looks quite cheerful.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I think I’d love to,’ said Vesper. ‘I’ll tidy up while you
put your winnings away. I’ll meet you in the entrance hall.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What about you, Felix?’ Bond hoped he could be alone
with Vesper.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter looked at him and read his mind.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’d rather take a little rest before breakfast,’ he said.
‘It’s been quite a day and I expect Paris will want me to do
a bit of mopping-up tomorrow. There are several loose
ends you won’t have to worry about. I shall. I’ll walk
over to the hotel with you. Might as well convoy the
treasure ship right into port.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They strolled over through the shadows cast by the full
moon. Both had their hands on their guns. It was three
o’clock in the morning, but there were several people about
and the courtyard of the Casino was still lined with motorcars.</p>

<p class="pindent">The short walk was uneventful.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the hotel, Leiter insisted on accompanying Bond to
his room. It was as Bond had left it six hours before.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No reception committee,’ observed Leiter, ‘but I
wouldn’t put it past them to try a last throw. Do you
think I ought to stay up and keep you two company?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You get your sleep,’ said Bond. ‘Don’t worry about us.
They won’t be interested in me without the money and
I’ve got an idea for looking after that. Thanks for all you’ve
done. I hope we get on a job again one day.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Suits me,’ said Leiter, ‘so long as you can draw a nine
when it’s needed—and bring Vesper along with you,’ he
added dryly. He went out and closed the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned back to the friendliness of his room.</p>

<p class="pindent">After the crowded arena of the big table and the nervous
strain of the three hours’ play, he was glad to be alone for a
moment and be welcomed by his pyjamas on the bed and
his hairbrushes on the dressing-table. He went into the
bathroom and dashed cold water over his face and gargled
with a sharp mouthwash. He felt the bruises on the back of
his head and on his right shoulder. He reflected cheerfully
how narrowly he had twice that day escaped being
murdered. Would he have to sit up all that night and wait
for them to come again, or was Le Chiffre even now on his
way to Le Havre or Bordeaux to pick up a boat for some
corner of the world where he could escape the eyes and the
guns of <span class="sc">smersh</span>?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shrugged his shoulders. Sufficient unto that day
had been its evil. He gazed for a moment into the mirror
and wondered about Vesper’s morals. He wanted her cold
and arrogant body. He wanted to see tears and desire in
her remote blue eyes and to take the ropes of her black hair
in his hands and bend her long body back under his.
Bond’s eyes narrowed and his face in the mirror looked
back at him with hunger.</p>

<p class="pindent">He turned away and took out of his pocket the cheque for
forty million francs. He folded this very small. Then he
opened the door and looked up and down the corridor. He
left the door wide open and with his ears cocked for footsteps
or the sound of the lift, he set to work with a small
screwdriver.</p>

<p class="pindent">Five minutes later he gave a last-minute survey to his
handiwork, put some fresh cigarettes in his case, closed and
locked the door and went off down the corridor and across
the hall and out into the moonlight.</p>
