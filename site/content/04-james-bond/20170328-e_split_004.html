<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">W</span>ITH its two fighting claws held forward like a wrestler’s
arms the big <span class="it">pandinus</span> scorpion emerged with a dry rustle
from the finger-sized hole under the rock.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a small patch of hard, flat earth outside the hole
and the scorpion stood in the centre of this on the tips of its four
pairs of legs, its nerves and muscles braced for a quick retreat
and its senses questing for the minute vibrations which would
decide its next move.</p>

<p class="pindent">The moonlight, glittering down through the great thorn bush,
threw sapphire highlights off the hard, black polish of the six-inch
body and glinted palely on the moist white sting which protruded
from the last segment of the tail, now curved over parallel with
the scorpion’s flat back.</p>

<p class="pindent">Slowly the sting slid home into its sheath and the nerves in the
poison sac at its base relaxed. The scorpion had decided. Greed
had won over fear.</p>

<p class="pindent">Twelve inches away, at the bottom of a sharp slope of sand,
the small beetle was concerned only with trudging on towards
better pastures than he had found under the thorn bush, and the
swift rush of the scorpion down the slope gave him no time to
open his wings. The beetle’s legs waved in protest as the sharp
claw snapped round his body, and then the sting lanced into him
from over the scorpion’s head and immediately he was dead.</p>

<p class="pindent">After it had killed the beetle the scorpion stood motionless for
nearly five minutes. During this time, it identified the nature of
its prey and again tested the ground and the air for hostile vibrations.
Reassured, its fighting claw withdrew from the half-severed
beetle and its two small feeding pincers reached out and into the
beetle’s flesh. Then for an hour, and with extreme fastidiousness,
the scorpion ate its victim.</p>

<p class="pindent">The great thorn bush under which the scorpion killed the
beetle was quite a landmark in the wide expanse of rolling veld
some forty miles south of Kissidougou in the south-western corner
of French Guinea. On all horizons there were hills and
jungle, but here, over twenty square miles, there was flat rocky
ground which was almost desert and amongst the tropical scrub
only this one thorn bush, perhaps because there was water deep
beneath its roots, had grown to the height of a house and could
be picked out from many miles away.</p>

<p class="pindent">The bush grew more or less at the junction of three African
states. It was in French Guinea but only about ten miles north
of the northernmost tip of Liberia and five miles east of the
frontier of Sierra Leone. Across this frontier are the great
diamond mines around Sefadu. These are the property of Sierra
International, which is part of the powerful mining empire of
Afric International, which in turn is a rich capital asset of the
British Commonwealth.</p>

<p class="pindent">An hour earlier in its hole among the roots of the great thorn
bush the scorpion had been alerted by two sets of vibrations.
First there had been the tiny scraping of the beetle’s movements,
and these belonged to the vibrations which the scorpion
immediately recognized and diagnosed. Then there had been a
series of incomprehensible thuds round the bush followed by
a final heavy quake which had caved in part of the scorpion’s
hole. These were followed by a soft rhythmic trembling of the
ground which was so regular that it soon became a background
vibration of no urgency. After a pause the tiny scraping of the
beetle had continued, and it was greed for the beetle that, after
a day of sheltering from its deadliest enemy, the sun, finally got
the upper hand against the scorpion’s memory of the other
noises and impelled it out of its lair into the filtering moonlight.</p>

<p class="pindent">And now, as it slowly sucked the morsels of beetle-flesh off
its feeding pincers, the signal for the scorpion’s own death
sounded from far away on the eastern horizon, audible to a
human, but made up of vibrations which were far outside the
range of the scorpion’s sensory system.</p>

<p class="pindent">And, a few feet away, a heavy, blunt hand, with bitten finger
nails, softly raised a jagged piece of rock.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was no noise, but the scorpion felt a tiny movement in
the air above it. At once its fighting claws were up and groping
and its sting was erect in the rigid tail, its near-sighted eyes
staring up for a sight of the enemy.</p>

<p class="pindent">The heavy stone came down.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Black bastard.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The man watched as the broken insect whipped in its death
agony.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man yawned. He got to his knees in the sandy depression
against the trunk of the bush where he had been sitting for
nearly two hours and, his arms bent protectingly over his head,
scrambled out into the open.</p>

<p class="pindent">The noise of the engine which the man had been waiting for,
and which had signed the scorpion’s death warrant, was louder.
As the man stood and stared up the path of the moon, he could
just see a clumsy black shape coming fast towards him out of
the east and for a moment the moonlight glinted on whirling
rotor blades.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man rubbed his hands down the sides of his dirty khaki
shorts and moved quickly round the bush to where the rear
wheel of a battered motor-cycle protruded from its hiding
place. Below the pillion, on either side, there were leather toolboxes.
From one of these he extracted a small heavy package
which he stowed inside his open shirt against the skin. From
the other he took four cheap electric torches and went off with
them to where, fifty yards from the big thorn bush, there was a
clear patch of flat ground about the size of a tennis court. At
three corners of the landing ground he screwed the butt end of
a torch into the ground and switched it on. Then, the last torch
alight in his hand, he took up his position at the fourth corner
and waited.</p>

<p class="pindent">The helicopter was moving slowly towards him, not more
than a hundred feet from the ground, the big rotor blades
idling. It looked like a huge, badly-constructed insect. To the
man on the ground it seemed, as usual, to be making too much
noise.</p>

<p class="pindent">The helicopter paused, pitching slightly, directly over his
head. An arm came out of the cockpit and a torch flashed at
him. It flashed dot-dash, the morse for A.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man on the ground flashed back a B and a C. He stuck
the fourth torch into the ground and moved away, shielding
his eyes against the coming whirl of dust. Above him the pitch
of the rotor blades flattened imperceptibly and the helicopter
settled smoothly into the space between the four torches. The
clatter of the engine stopped with a final cough, the tail rotor
spun briefly in neutral, and the main rotor blades completed a
few awkward revolutions and then drooped to a halt.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the echoing silence, a cricket started to zing in the thorn
bush, and somewhere near at hand there was the anxious chirrup
of a nightbird.</p>

<p class="pindent">After a pause to let the dust settle, the pilot banged open the
door of the cockpit, pushed out a small aluminium ladder and
climbed stiffly to the ground. He waited beside his machine
while the other man walked round the four corners of the
landing ground picking up and dowsing the torches. The pilot
was half an hour late at the rendezvous and he was bored at
the prospect of listening to the other man’s inevitable complaint.
He despised all Afrikaners. This one in particular. To a Reichsdeutscher
and to a Luftwaffe pilot who had fought under
Galland in defence of the Reich they were a bastard race, sly,
stupid and ill-bred. Of course this brute had a tricky job, but it
was nothing to navigating a helicopter five hundred miles over
the jungle in the middle of the night, and then taking it back
again.</p>

<p class="pindent">As the other man came up, the pilot half raised his hand in
greeting. “Everything all right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I hope so. But you’re late again. I shall only just make it
through the frontier by first light.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Magneto trouble. We all have our worries. Thank God
there are only thirteen full moons a year. Well, if you’ve got the
stuff let’s have it and we’ll tank her up and I’ll be off.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Without speaking, the man from the diamond mines reached
into his shirt and handed over the neat, heavy packet.</p>

<p class="pindent">The pilot took it. It was damp with the sweat from the
smuggler’s ribs. The pilot dropped it into a side pocket of his
trim bush-shirt. He put his hand behind him and wiped his
fingers on the seat of his shorts.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Good,” he said. He turned towards his machine.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Just a moment,” said the diamond smuggler. There was a
sullen note in his voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">The pilot turned back and faced him. He thought: it’s the
voice of a servant who has screwed himself up to complain
about his food. “Ja. What is it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Things are getting too hot. At the mines. I don’t like it at
all. There’s been a big intelligence man down from London.
You’ve read about him. This man Sillitoe. They say he’s been
hired by the Diamond Corporation. There’ve been a lot of new
regulations and all punishments have been doubled. It’s frightened
out some of my smaller men. I had to be ruthless and, well,
one of them somehow fell into the crusher. That tightened
things up a bit. But I’ve had to pay more. An extra ten per cent.
And they’re still not satisfied. One of these days those security
people are going to get one of my middlemen. And you know
these black swine. They can’t stand a real beating.” He looked
swiftly into the pilot’s eyes and then away again. “For the
matter of that I doubt if anyone could stand the sjambok. Not
even me.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“So?” said the pilot. He paused. “Do you want me to pass
this threat back to ABC?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m not threatening anyone,” said the other man hastily. “I
just want them to know that it’s getting tough. They must
know it themselves. They must know about this man Sillitoe.
And look what the Chairman said in our annual report. He said
that our mines were losing more than two million pounds a
year through smuggling and IDB and that it was up to the
government to stop it. And what does that mean? It means
‘stop me’!”</p>

<p class="pindent">“And me,” said the pilot mildly. “So what do you want?
More money?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes,” said the other man stubbornly. “I want a bigger cut.
Twenty per cent more or I’ll have to quit.” He tried to read
some sympathy in the pilot’s face.</p>

<p class="pindent">“All right,” said the pilot indifferently. “I’ll pass the message
on to Dakar, and if they’re interested I expect they’ll send it on
to London. But it’s nothing to do with me, and if I were you,”
the pilot unbent for the first time, “I wouldn’t put too much
pressure on these people. They can be much tougher than this
Sillitoe, or the Company, or any government I’ve ever heard of.
On just this end of the pipeline, three men have died in the last
twelve months. One for being yellow. Two for stealing from
the packet. And you know it. That was a nasty accident your
predecessor had, wasn’t it? Funny place to keep gelignite. Under
his bed. Unlike him. He was always so careful about everything.”</p>

<p class="pindent">For a moment they stood and looked at each other in the
moonlight. The diamond smuggler shrugged his shoulders. “All
right,” he said. “Just tell them I’m hard up and need more
money to pass down the line. They’ll understand that, and if
they’ve got any sense they’ll add another ten per cent on for me.
If not . . .” He left the sentence unfinished and moved towards
the helicopter. “Come on. I’ll give you a hand with the gas.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Ten minutes later the pilot climbed up into the cockpit and
pulled the ladder in after him. Before he shut the door he raised
a hand. “So long,” he said. “See you in a month.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The man on the ground suddenly felt lonely. “<span class="it">Totsiens</span>,” he
said with a wave of the hand that was almost the wave of a lover.
“<span class="it">Alles van die beste.</span>” He stood back and held a hand up to his
eyes against the dust.</p>

<p class="pindent">The pilot settled into his seat and fastened the seat-belt, feeling
for the rudder pedals with his feet. He made sure that the wheel
brakes were on, pushed the pitch control lever right down,
turned on the fuel and pressed the starter. Satisfied with the beat
of the engine, he released the rotor brake and softly twisted the
throttle on the pitch control. Outside the cabin windows the long
rotor blades slowly swung by and the pilot glanced astern at the
whirring tail rotor. He settled himself back and watched the
rotor speed indicator creep up to 200 revolutions a minute. When
the needle was just over the 200, he released the wheel brakes
and pulled up slowly and firmly on the pitch lever. Above him
the blades of the rotor tilted and bit deeper into the air. More
throttle, and the machine slowly rose clattering towards the sky
until, at about 100 feet, the pilot simultaneously gave it left
rudder and pushed forward the joystick between his knees.</p>

<p class="pindent">The helicopter swung towards the east and, gathering height
and speed, roared away back up the path of the moon.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man on the ground watched it go, and with it the £100,000
worth of diamonds his men had filched from the diggings during
the past month and had casually held out on their pink tongues
as he stood beside the dentist’s chair and brusquely inquired
where it hurt.</p>

<p class="pindent">Still talking about their teeth, he would pick the stones out of
their mouths and hold them up to the dentist’s spotlight, and
then softly he would say 50, 75, 100; and they always nodded
and took the notes and hid them in their clothes and went out
of the surgery with a couple of aspirins in a twist of paper as an
alibi. They had to accept his price. There was no hope of a native
getting diamonds out. When the miners did get out, perhaps
once a year to visit their tribe or to bury a relative, there was a
whole routine of X-rays and castor oil to be gone through, and
a grim future if they were caught. It was so easy to go to the
dental surgery and pick the day when ‘Him’ was on duty. And
paper-money didn’t show up on X-rays.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man wheeled his motor-cycle over the rough ground on to
the narrow trail and started off towards the frontier hills of
Sierra Leone. They were more distinct now. He would only just
have time to get to Susie’s hut before dawn. He grimaced at the
thought of having to make love to her at the end of an exhausting
night. But it would have to be done. Money was not enough to
pay for the alibi she gave him. It was his white body she wanted.
And then another ten miles to the club for breakfast and the
coarse jokes of his friends.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Do a nice bit of inlay, Doc?” “I hear she has the best set of
frontals in the Province.” “Say Doc, what is it the full moon
does to you?”</p>

<p class="pindent">But each £100,000 worth meant £1000 for him in a London
safe deposit. Nice crisp fivers. It was worth it. By God it was.
But not for much longer. No sir! At £20,000 he would definitely
quit. And then. . . . ?</p>

<p class="pindent">His mind full of lush dreams, the man on the motor-cycle
bumped his way as fast as he could across the plain—away from
the great thorn bush where the pipeline for the richest smuggling
operation in the world started its devious route to where it would
finally gush out on to soft bosoms, five thousand miles away.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_2">2<br class="lgl"/> <span class="gesp">GEM QUALITY</span></h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">D</span>ON’T push it in. Screw it in,” said M impatiently.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond, making a mental note to pass M’s dictum
on to the Chief of Staff, again picked up the jeweller’s glass from
the desk where it had fallen and this time managed to fix it
securely into the socket of his right eye.</p>

<p class="pindent">Although it was late July and the room was bright with sunshine,
M had switched on his desk light and tilted it so that it
shone straight at Bond. Bond picked the brilliant-cut stone up
and held it to the light. As he turned it between his fingers, all
the colours of the rainbow flashed back at him from its mesh of
facets until his eye was tired with the dazzle.</p>

<p class="pindent">He took out the jeweller’s glass and tried to think of something
appropriate to say.</p>

<p class="pindent">M looked at him quizzically. “Fine stone?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Wonderful,” said Bond. “It must be worth a lot of money.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“A few pounds for the cutting,” said M dryly. “It’s a bit of
quartz. Now then, let’s try again.” He consulted a list on the
desk in front of him and selected a fold of tissue paper, verified
the number written on it, unfolded it and pushed it across to
Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond put the piece of quartz back into its own wrapping and
picked up the second sample.</p>

<p class="pindent">“It’s easy for you, Sir,” he smiled at M. “You’ve got the crib.”
He screwed the glass back into his eye and held the stone, if it
was a stone, up to the light.</p>

<p class="pindent">This time, he thought, there could be no doubt about it. This
stone also had the thirty-two facets above and the twenty-four
below of the brilliant-cut, and it was also about twenty carats,
but what he now held had a heart of blue-white flame, and the
infinite colours reflected and refracted from its depths lanced into
his eye like needles. With his left hand he picked up the quartz
dummy and held it beside the diamond in front of his glass. It
was a lifeless chunk of matter, almost opaque beside the dazzling
translucence of the diamond, and the rainbow colours he had
seen a few minutes before were now coarse and muddy.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond put down the piece of quartz and gazed again into the
heart of the diamond. Now he could understand the passion that
diamonds had inspired through the centuries, the almost sexual
love they aroused among those who handled them and cut them
and traded in them. It was domination by a beauty so pure that
it held a kind of truth, a divine authority before which all other
material things turned, like the bit of quartz, to clay. In these
few minutes Bond understood the myth of diamonds, and he
knew that he would never forget what he had suddenly seen
inside the heart of this stone.</p>

<p class="pindent">He put the diamond down on its slip of paper and dropped
the jeweller’s glass into the palm of his hand. He looked across
into M’s watchful eyes. “Yes,” he said. “I see.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M sat back in his chair. “That’s what Jacoby meant when I
had lunch with him the other day at the Diamond Corporation,”
he said. “He said that if I was going to get involved in the
diamond business I ought to try and understand what was really
at the bottom of it all. Not just the millions of money involved,
or the value of diamonds as a hedge against inflation, or the
sentimental fashions in diamonds for engagement rings and so
forth. He said one must understand the passion for diamonds. So
he just showed me what I’m showing you. And,” M smiled
thinly at Bond, “if it will give you any satisfaction, I was just as
taken in by that bit of quartz as you were.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat still and said nothing.</p>

<p class="pindent">“And now let’s run through the rest,” said M. He gestured
towards the pile of paper packets in front of him. “I said I’d
like to borrow some samples. They didn’t seem to mind. Sent
this lot round to my house this morning.” M consulted his list,
opened a packet and pushed it across to Bond. “What you were
looking at just now was the best—a ‘Fine Blue-white’.” He
gestured towards the big diamond in front of Bond. “Now
this is a ‘Top Crystal’, ten carats, baguette-cut. Very fine stone,
but worth about half a ‘Blue-white’. You’ll see there’s the faintest
trace of yellow in it. The ‘Cape’ I’m going to show you next has
a slight brownish tinge, according to Jacoby, but I’m damned if
I can see it. I doubt if anyone can except the experts.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond obediently picked up the ‘Top Crystal’ and for the next
quarter of an hour M led him through the whole range of
diamonds down to a wonderful series of coloured stones, ruby
red, blue, pink, yellow, green and violet. Finally, M pushed over
a packet of smaller stones, all flawed or marked or of poor
colour. “Industrial diamonds. Not what they call ‘gem quality’.
Used in machine tools and so forth. But don’t despise them.
America bought £5,000,000 worth of them last year, and that’s
only one of the markets. Bronsteen told me it was stones like
these that were used for cutting the St Gothard tunnel. At the
other end of the scale, dentists use them for drilling your teeth.
They’re the hardest substance in the world. Last forever.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M pulled out his pipe and started to fill it. “And now you
know as much about diamonds as I do.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat back in his chair and gazed vaguely at the bits of
tissue paper and glittering stones that lay scattered across the red
leather surface of M’s desk. He wondered what it was all about.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was the rasp of a match against a box and Bond
watched M tamp the burning tobacco down in the bowl of his
pipe and then put the matchbox back in his pocket and tilt his
chair in M’s favourite attitude for reflection.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond glanced down at his watch. It was 11.30. Bond thought
with pleasure of the in-tray piled with Top Secret dockets he
had gladly abandoned when the red telephone had summoned
him an hour before. He felt fairly confident that now he
wouldn’t have to deal with them. “I guess it’s a job,” the Chief
of Staff had said in answer to Bond’s inquiry. “The Chief says
he won’t take any more calls before lunch and he’s made an
appointment for you at the Yard for two o’clock. Step on it.”
And Bond had reached for his coat and had gone into the outer
office where he was pleased to see his secretary registering in
another bulky file with a Most Immediate tab.</p>

<p class="pindent">“M,” said Bond as she looked up. “And Bill says it looks like
a job. So don’t think you’re going to have the pleasure of shovelling
that lot into my in-tray. You can post it off to the <span class="it">Daily
Express</span> for all I care.” He grinned at her. “Isn’t that chap
Sefton Delmer a boy friend of yours, Lil? Just the stuff for him,
I expect.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked at him appraisingly. “Your tie’s crooked,” she said
coldly. “And anyway I hardly know him.” She bent over her
registry and Bond went out and along the corridor and thought
how lucky he was to have a beautiful secretary.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a creak from M’s chair and Bond looked across
the table at the man who held a great deal of his affection and
all his loyalty and obedience.</p>

<p class="pindent">The grey eyes looked back at him thoughtfully. M took the
pipe out of his mouth. “How long have you been back from
that holiday in France?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Two weeks, Sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Have a good time?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Not bad, Sir. Got a bit bored towards the end.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M made no comment. “I’ve been looking at your record sheet.
Small-arms marks seem to be keeping well up in the top bracket.
Unarmed combat’s satisfactory and your last medical shows
you’re in pretty good shape.” M paused. “The point is,” he
went on unemotionally, “I’ve got rather a tough assignment for
you. Wanted to make sure you’d be able to take care of yourself.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course, Sir.” Bond was slightly nettled.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’t make any mistake about this job, 007,” said M sharply.
“When I say it may be tough, I’m not being melodramatic.
There are plenty of tricky people you haven’t met yet, and there
may be some of them mixed up in this business. And some of
the most efficient. So don’t be tetchy when I think twice before
getting you involved in it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sorry, Sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“All right then,” M put his pipe down and leant forward with
his arms crossed on the desk. “I’ll tell you the story and then
you can decide whether you want to take it on.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“A week ago,” said M, “one of the high-ups in the Treasury
came to see me. Brought with him the Permanent Secretary to
the Board of Trade. It had to do with diamonds. Seems that
most of what they call ‘gem’ diamonds in the world are mined
on British territory and that ninety per cent of all diamond sales
are carried out in London. By the Diamond Corporation.” M
shrugged his shoulders. “Don’t ask me why. The British got hold
of the business at the beginning of the century and we’ve
managed to hang on to it. Now it’s a huge trade. Fifty million
pounds a year. The biggest dollar-earner we’ve got. So when
something goes wrong with it, the Government gets worried.
And that’s what’s happened.” M looked mildly across at Bond.
“At least two million pounds worth of diamonds are being
smuggled out of Africa every year.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s a lot of money,” said Bond. “Where are they going
to?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“They say America,” said M. “And I agree with them. It’s by
far the biggest diamond market. And those gangs of theirs are
the only people who could run an operation on this scale.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Why don’t the mining companies stop it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“They’ve done everything they can,” said M. “You probably
saw in the papers that De Beers took on our friend Sillitoe when
he left MI5, and he’s out there now, working in with the South
African security people. I gather he’s put in a pretty drastic
report and come up with plenty of bright ideas for tightening
things up, but the Treasury and the Board of Trade aren’t very
impressed. They think the thing’s too big to be handled by a lot
of separate mining companies, however efficient they are. And
they’ve got one very good reason for wanting to take official
action on their own.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What’s that, Sir?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“There’s a big packet of smuggled stones in London at this
very moment,” said M, and his eyes glittered across the desk at
Bond. “Waiting to go to America. And the Special Branch
know who the carrier is to be. And they know who’s to go out
with him to keep an eye on him. As soon as Ronnie Vallance
came across the story—it was leaked to one of his narks in Soho,
to one of his ‘Ghost Squad’ as he chooses to call it—he went
straight off to the Treasury. The Treasury talked to the Board
of Trade and then both their Ministers formed up to the PM.
And the PM gave them authority to use the Service.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Why not let the Special Branch of MI5 handle it, Sir?” asked
Bond, reflecting that M seemed to be going through a bad phase
of mixing in other people’s business.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course they could arrest the carriers as soon as they took
delivery and tried to get out of the country,” said M impatiently.
“But that won’t stop the traffic. These people aren’t the sort that
talk. Anyway the carriers are only small fry. They probably just
get the stuff from a man in a park and hand it over to another
man in a park when they get to the other side. The only way to
get to the bottom of the business is to follow the pipeline to
America and see where it goes to there. And the FBI won’t be
much help to us, I’m afraid. It’s a very small part of their battle
with the big-time gangs. And it’s not doing any harm to the
United States. Rather the reverse if anything. It’s only England
that’s the loser. And America is outside the jurisdiction of the
police and MI5. Only the Service can handle the job.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, I see that,” said Bond. “But have we got anything else
to go on?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Ever heard of ‘The House of Diamonds’?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, of course, Sir,” said Bond. “The big American jewellers.
On West 46th Street in New York and the Rue de Rivoli in
Paris. I gather they rank almost as high as Cartier and Van Cleef
and Boucheron nowadays. They’ve come up very quickly since
the war.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes,” said M. “Those are the people. They’ve got a small
place in London, too. Hatton Garden. Used to be very big buyers
at the monthly showings of the Diamond Corporation. But for
the last three years they’ve bought less and less. Although, as
you say, they seem to be selling more and more jewellery every
year. Must be getting their diamonds from somewhere. It was
the Treasury who brought their name up at our meeting the
other day. But I can’t find out anything against them. They’ve
got one of their biggest men in charge over here. Seems odd as
they do so little business. Man called Rufus B. Saye. Nothing
much known about him. Lunches every day at the American
Club in Piccadilly. Plays golf at Sunningdale. Doesn’t drink or
smoke. Lives at the Savoy. Model citizen.” M shrugged his
shoulders. “But the diamond business is a nice, well-regulated
sort of family affair, and there’s an impression that the House of
Diamonds has an awkward look about it. Nothing more than
that.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond decided it was time to put the sixty-four thousand dollar
question. “And where do I come in, Sir?” he asked, looking
across the desk into M’s eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You’ve got an appointment with Vallance at the Yard in”—M
looked at his watch—“just over an hour. He’s going to start
you off. They’re going to pull in this carrier tonight and put you
into the pipeline instead of him.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s fingers curled softly round the arms of his chair.</p>

<p class="pindent">“And then?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“And then,” said M matter-of-factly, “you’re going to smuggle
those diamonds into America. At least that’s the idea. What
do you think of it?”</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_3">3<br class="lgl"/> <span class="gesp">HOT ICE</span></h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">J</span>AMES BOND shut the door of M’s office behind him. He
smiled into the warm brown eyes of Miss Moneypenny and
walked across her office into the Chief of Staff’s room.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Chief of Staff, a lean relaxed man of about Bond’s age,
put down his pen and sat back in his chair. He watched as Bond
automatically reached for the flat gun-metal cigarette case in his
hip pocket and walked over to the open window and looked
down on to Regent’s Park.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a thoughtful deliberation in Bond’s movements
that answered the Chief of Staff’s question.</p>

<p class="pindent">“So you’ve bought it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned round. “Yes,” he said. He lit a cigarette.
Through the smoke, his eyes looked very directly at the Chief
of Staff. “But just tell me this, Bill. Why’s the old man got cold
feet about this job? He’s even looked up the results of my last
medical. What’s he so worried about? It’s not as if this was
Iron Curtain business. America’s a civilized country. More or
less. What’s eating him?”</p>

<p class="pindent">It was the Chief of Staff’s duty to know most of what went
on in M’s mind. His own cigarette had gone out and he lit it
and threw the spent match over his left shoulder. He looked
round to see whether it had fallen in the wastepaper basket. It
had. He smiled up at Bond. “Constant practice,” he said. Then:
“There aren’t many things that worry M, James, and you know
that as well as anybody in the Service. SMERSH, of course.
The German cypher-breakers. The Chinese opium ring—or at
any rate the power they have all over the world. The authority
of the Mafia. And, and he’s got a damned healthy respect for
them, the American gangs. The big ones. That’s all. Those are
the only people that get him worried. And this diamond business
looks as if it’s pretty certain to bring you up against the
gangs. They’re the last people he expected us to get mixed up
with. He’s got quite enough on his plate without them. That’s
all. That’s what’s giving him cold feet about this job.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“There’s nothing so extraordinary about American gangsters,”
protested Bond. “They’re not Americans. Mostly a lot of Italian
bums with monogrammed shirts who spend the day eating
spaghetti and meat-balls and squirting scent over themselves.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s what you think,” said the Chief of Staff. “But the
point is that those are only the ones you see. There are better
ones behind them, and still better ones behind those. Look at
narcotics. Ten million addicts. Where do they get the stuff
from? Look at gambling—legitimate gambling. Two hundred
and fifty million dollars a year is the take at Las Vegas. Then
there are the undercover games at Miami and Chicago and so
on. All owned by the gangs and their friends. A few years ago,
Bugsy Siegel got the back of his head blown off because he
wanted too much of the take from the Las Vegas operation.
And he was tough enough. These are big operations. Do you
realize gambling’s the biggest single industry in America? Bigger
than steel. Bigger than motor cars? And they take damned
good care to keep it running smoothly. Get hold of a copy of
the Kefauver Report if you don’t believe me. And now these
diamonds. Six million dollars a year is good money, and you
can bet your life it’ll be well protected.” The Chief of Staff
paused. He looked impatiently up at the tall figure in the dark
blue single-breasted suit and into the obstinate eyes in the lean,
brown face. “Perhaps you haven’t read the FBI Report on
American Crime for this year. Interesting. Just thirty-four murders
every day. Nearly 150,000 Americans criminally killed in
the last twenty years.” Bond looked incredulous. “It’s a fact,
damn you. Get hold of these Reports and see for yourself. And
that’s why M wanted to make sure you were fit before he put
you into the pipeline. You’re going to take those gangs on. And
you’ll be by yourself. Satisfied?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s face relaxed. “Come on, Bill,” he said. “If that’s all
there is to it, I’ll buy you lunch. It’s my turn and I feel like
celebrating. No more paperwork this summer. I’ll take you to
Scotts’ and we’ll have some of their dressed crab and a pint of
black velvet. You’ve taken a load off my mind. I thought there
might be some ghastly snag about this job.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“All right, blast you.” The Chief of Staff put aside the misgivings
which he fully shared with his Chief, and followed
Bond out of the office and slammed the door with unnecessary
force behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Later, punctually at two o’clock, Bond was shaking hands
with the dapper, level-eyed man in the old-fashioned office
which hears more secrets than any other room in Scotland Yard.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had made friends with Assistant Commissioner Vallance
over the Moonraker affair and there was no need to waste time
on preliminaries.</p>

<p class="pindent">Vallance pushed a couple of CID identification photographs
across the desk. They showed a dark-haired, rather good-looking
young man with a clean-cut, swashbuckling face in which
the eyes smiled innocently.</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s the chap,” said Vallance. “Near enough like you to
pass with someone who’s only got his description. Peter Franks.
Nice-looking fellow. Good family. Public school and all that.
Then he went wrong and stayed wrong. Country house burglaries
are his line. May have been on the Duke of Windsor job
at Sunningdale a few years ago. We’ve pulled him in once or
twice, but we could never get anything to stick. Now he’s slipped
up. They often do when they get into a racket they know nothing
about. I’ve got two or three undercover girls in Soho and he’s
keen on one of them. Funnily enough, she’s rather keen on
him. Thinks she can make him go straight and all that sort of
stuff. But she’s got her job to do, and when he told her about
this job, just casually, as if it was the hell of a lark, she passed
the word back here.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond nodded. “Specialist crooks never take other people’s
lines seriously. I bet he wouldn’t have talked to her about one
of his country house jobs.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Not on your life,” agreed Vallance. “Or we’d have had him
inside years ago. Anyway, it seems he was contacted by a friend
of a friend and agreed to do a smuggling job to America for
$5000. Payable on delivery. My girl asked him if it was drugs.
And he laughed and said ‘no—better still, Hot Ice’. Had he got
the diamonds? No. His next job was to contact his ‘guard’.
Tomorrow evening at the Trafalgar Palace. Five o’clock in her
room. A girl called Case. She would tell him what to do and
go over with him.” Vallance got up and paced to and fro in
front of the framed forgeries of five-pound notes that lined the
wall opposite the windows. “These smugglers generally go in
pairs when big stuff is being moved. The carrier is never quite
trusted, and the men at the other end like to have a witness in
case anything goes wrong at the customs. Then the big men
don’t get caught napping if the carrier talks.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Big stuff being moved. Carriers. Customs. Guards. Bond
killed his cigarette in the ash-tray on Vallance’s desk. How
often, in his early days in his own Service, had he been part of
this same routine—through Strasbourg into Germany, through
Niegoreloye into Russia, over the Simplon, across the Pyrenees.
The tension. The dry mouth. The nails ground into the palms
of the hands. And now, having graduated away from all that,
here he was going through with it again.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, I see,” said Bond, dodging his memories. “But what’s
the general picture? Got any ideas? What sort of an operation
was Franks going to fit in to?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, the diamonds certainly come from Africa.” Vallance’s
eyes were opaque. “Probably not the Union mines. More likely
the big leak out of Sierra Leone our friend Sillitoe’s been looking
for. Then the stones may get out through Liberia, or more
likely French Guinea. Then perhaps into France. And since this
packet’s turned up in London, presumably London’s part of the
pipeline too.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Vallance stopped his pacing and faced Bond. “And now we
know that this packet is on its way to America, and what happens
to it there is anybody’s guess. The operators wouldn’t try
and save money on the cutting—that’s where half the price of a
diamond goes—so it looks as if the stones get funnelled into
some legitimate diamond business and then get cut and marketed
like any other stones.” Vallance paused. “You won’t mind if I
give you a bit of advice?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’t be ridiculous.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well,” said Vallance, “in all these jobs the payoff to subordinates
is generally the weakest link. How was this $5000 to
be paid to Peter Franks? Who by? And if he did the job successfully,
would he be taken on again? If I was in your shoes
I’d watch these points. Concentrate on getting through the cut-out
who does the paying off and try to get on farther up the
pipeline towards the big men. If they like the look of you it
shouldn’t be difficult. Good carriers aren’t easy to come by, and
even the top men are going to be interested in the new recruit.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes,” said Bond thoughtfully, “that makes sense. The main
trouble will be to get past the first contact in America. Let’s
hope the whole job doesn’t blow up in my face in the customs
shed at Idlewild. I shall look pretty silly if the Inspectoscope
picks me up. But I expect this Case woman will have some
bright ideas about actually carrying the stuff. And now what’s
the first step? How are you going to substitute me for Peter
Franks?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Vallance started pacing to and fro again. “I think that ought
to be all right,” he said. “We’re going to take in Franks this
evening and hold him for conspiring to evade the customs.” He
smiled briefly. “It’ll break up a beautiful friendship with my
girl I’m afraid. But that’s got to be faced. And then the idea
is for you to make the rendezvous with Miss Case.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Does she know anything about Franks?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Just his description and his name,” said Vallance. “At least
that’s what we guess. I doubt if she even knows the man who
contacted him. Cut-outs all along the line. Everybody does one
job in a watertight compartment. Then, if there’s a hole in the
sock, it doesn’t run.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Know anything about the woman?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Passport details. American citizen. 27. Born San Francisco.
Blonde. Blue eyes. Height 5 ft 6 in. Profession: single woman.
Been over here a dozen times in the last three years. May have
been more often under a different name. Always stays at the
Trafalgar Palace. The hotel detective says she doesn’t seem to
go out much. Few visitors. Never stays more than two weeks.
Never gives any trouble. That’s all. Don’t forget that when you
meet her you’ll have to have a good story yourself. Why you’re
doing the job and so on.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’ll see to that.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Anything else we can help over?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond reflected. The rest seemed to be up to him. Once he
had got into the pipe it would just be a question of improvising.
Then he remembered the jewellery firm. “What about this House
of Diamonds lead the Treasury dreamed up? Seems a long shot.
Any views?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Quite honestly I hadn’t bothered with them.” There was
apology in Vallance’s voice. “I checked on this man Saye, but
again it’s a blank except for his passport details. American. 45.
Diamond merchant. And so on. He goes to Paris a lot. Been
going once a month for the last three years as a matter of fact.
Probably got a girl there. Tell you what. Why not go along
and have a look at the place and at him? You never can tell.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“How would I set about that?” asked Bond dubiously.</p>

<p class="pindent">Vallance didn’t answer. Instead he pressed a switch on the
big intercom on his desk.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, Sir?” said a metallic voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Send up Dankwaerts at the double, please Sergeant. And
Lobiniere. And then get me the House of Diamonds on the
telephone. Gem merchants in Hatton Garden. Ask for Mr Saye.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Vallance went and looked out of the window at the river. He
took a cigarette lighter out of his waistcoat pocket and flicked
at it absent-mindedly. There was a knock on the door and Vallance’s
staff secretary put his head in. “Sergeant Dankwaerts,
Sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Send him in,” said Vallance, “Hold Lobiniere until I ring.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The secretary held open the door and a nondescript man in
plain-clothes came in. His hair was thinning, he wore spectacles
and his complexion was pale. His expression was kindly
and studious. He might have been any senior clerk in any business.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Afternoon, Sergeant,” said Vallance. “This is Commander
Bond of the Ministry of Defence.” The Sergeant smiled politely.
“I want you to take Commander Bond to the House of Diamonds
in Hatton Garden. He will be ‘Sergeant James’ of your
staff. You think the diamonds from that Ascot job are on their
way out to the Argentine through America. You will say-so to
Mr Saye, the top man there. You will wonder if it is possible
that Mr Saye has heard any talk from the other side. His New
York office may have heard something. You know, all very nice
and polite. But just look him in the eye. Put as much pressure
on as you can without giving any grounds for complaint. Then
apologize and leave and forget all about it. All right? Any
questions?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No, Sir,” said Sergeant Dankwaerts stolidly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Vallance spoke into the intercom and a moment later there
appeared a sallow, rather ingratiating man wearing extremely
smart plain-clothes and carrying a small attaché case. He stood
waiting just inside the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Good afternoon, Sergeant. Come and have a look at this
friend of mine.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The Sergeant came and stood close up to Bond and politely
turned him towards the light. Two very keen dark eyes
examined his face minutely for a full minute. Then the man
stepped away.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Can’t guarantee the scar for more than six hours, Sir,” he
said. “Not in this heat. But the rest’s all right. Who is he to be,
Sir?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“He’s to be Sergeant James, a member of Sergeant Dankwaerts’s
staff.” Vallance looked at his watch. “Only for three
hours. All right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Certainly, Sir. Shall I go ahead?” At Vallance’s nod, the
policeman led Bond to a chair by the window, put his small
attaché case on the floor beside the chair and knelt down on one
knee and opened it. Then, for ten minutes, his light fingers
busied themselves over Bond’s face and hair.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond resigned himself and listened to Vallance talking to the
House of Diamonds. “Not until 3.30? In that case would
you please tell Mr Saye that two of my men will be calling on
him at 3.30 sharp. Yes, I’m afraid it is rather important. Only a
formality of course. Routine inquiry. I don’t expect it will take
up more than ten minutes of Mr Saye’s time. Thank you so
much. Yes. Assistant Commissioner Vallance. That’s right
Scotland Yard. Yes. Thank you. Goodbye.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Vallance put back the receiver and turned towards Bond.
“Secretary says Saye won’t be back until 3.30. I suggest you get
there at 3.15. Never does any harm to have a look round first.
Always useful to get your man a bit off balance. How’s it
going?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Sergeant Lobiniere held up a pocket mirror in front of Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">A touch of white at the temples. The scar gone. A hint of
studiousness at the corners of the eyes and mouth. The faintest
shadows under the cheekbones. Nothing you could put your
finger on, but it all added up to someone who certainly wasn’t
James Bond.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_4">4<br class="lgl"/> <span class="gesp">“WHAT GOES ON AROUND HERE?”</span></h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the patrol car Sergeant Dankwaerts was occupied with his
thoughts, and they drove in silence along the Strand and up
Chancery Lane and into Holborn. At Gamages they turned left
into Hatton Garden and the car drew up near the neat white
portals of the London Diamond Club.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond followed his companion across the pavement to a smart
door in the centre of which was a well polished brass plate on
which was engraved ‘The House of Diamonds’. And underneath
‘Rufus B. Saye. Vice-President for Europe’. Sergeant
Dankwaerts rang the bell and a smart Jewish girl opened the
door and led them across a thickly carpeted entrance hall into a
panelled waiting-room.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I am expecting Mr Saye any minute now,” she said indifferently
and went out and closed the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">The waiting-room was luxurious and, thanks to an unseasonable
log-fire in the Adam fireplace, tropically hot. In the centre
of the close-fitted dark red carpet there was a circular Sheraton
rosewood table and six matching armchairs that Bond guessed
were worth at least a thousand pounds. On the table were the
latest magazines and several copies of the Kimberley <span class="it">Diamond
News</span>. Dankwaerts’s eyes lit up when he saw these and he sat
down and started to turn over the pages of the June issue.</p>

<p class="pindent">On each of the four walls was a large flower painting in a
golden frame. Something almost three dimensional about these
paintings caught Bond’s attention and he walked over to examine
one of them. It was not a painting, but a stylized arrangement
of freshly cut flowers set behind glass in niches lined with copper-coloured
velvet. The others were the same, and the four Waterford
vases in which the flowers stood were a perfect set.</p>

<p class="pindent">The room was very quiet except for the hypnotic tick of a
large sunburst wall-clock and the soft murmur of voices from
behind a door opposite the entrance. There was a click and the
door opened a few inches and a voice with a thick foreign intonation
expostulated volubly: “Bud Mister Grunspan, why
being so hard? Vee must all make a liffing, yes? I am telling you
this vonderful stone gost me ten tousant pounts. Ten tousant!
You ton’t pelieff me? Bud I svear it. On my vort of honour.”
There was a negative pause and the voice made its final bid.
“Bedder still! I bet you fife pounts!”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was the sound of laughter. “Willy, you’re a real card,”
said an American voice. “But it’s no dice. Be glad to help you,
but that stone isn’t worth more than nine thousand, and I’ll give
you a hundred on top of that for yourself. Now you go along and
think about it. You won’t get a better offer in The Street.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The door opened and a stage American businessman with
pince-nez and a tightly buttoned mouth ushered out a small
harassed-looking Jew with a large red rose in his buttonhole.
They looked startled at finding the waiting-room occupied and,
with a muttered “Pardon me” to no one in particular, the
American almost ran his companion across the room and out
into the hall. The door closed behind them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Dankwaerts looked up at Bond and winked. “That’s the
whole of the diamond business in a nutshell,” he said. “That
was Willy Behrens, one of the best-known freelance brokers in
The Street. I suppose the other man was Saye’s buyer.” He
turned again to his paper, and Bond, resisting the impulse to
light a cigarette, went back to his examination of the flower
‘pictures’.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly the rich, carpeted, ticking silence of the room struck
like a cuckoo clock. Simultaneously, a log fell in the grate, the
sunburst clock on the wall chimed the half hour, the door was
thrust open and a big, dark man took two quick steps in the
room and stood looking sharply from one to the other.</p>

<p class="pindent">“My name is Saye,” he said harshly. “What goes on around
here? What do you want?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The door was open behind him. Sergeant Dankwaerts rose to
his feet and walked politely but firmly round the man and closed
it. Then he returned to the middle of the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I am Sergeant Dankwaerts of the Special Branch of Scotland
Yard,” he said in a quiet, peaceful voice. “And this,” he made
a gesture towards Bond, “is Sergeant James. I am making a
routine inquiry about some stolen diamonds. It occurred to the
Assistant Commissioner,” the voice was of velvet, “that you
might be able to help us.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes?” said Mr Saye. He looked contemptuously from one to
the other of these two underpaid flatfeet who had the effrontery
to be taking up his time. “Go ahead.”</p>

<p class="pindent">While Sergeant Dankwaerts, in tones which to a law-breaker
would have sounded menacingly level, and consulting from time
to time a small black note-book, recited a story studded with ‘on
the 16th instant’s’ and ‘it came to our knowledge’s’, Bond made
an unconcealed examination of Mr Saye which appeared to perturb
Mr Saye no more than the undertones of Sergeant Dankwaerts’s
recitation.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Saye was a large, compact man with the hardness of a
chunk of quartz. He had a very square face whose sharp angles
were accentuated by short, wiry black hair, cut <span class="it">en brosse</span> and
without side-whiskers. His eyebrows were black and straight,
and tucked in below them there were two extremely sharp and
steady black eyes. He was clean-shaven and his lips were a thin
and rather wide straight line. The square chin was deeply cleft
and the muscles bulged at the points of the jaw. He was dressed
in a roomy, black, single-breasted suit, a white shirt and an
almost bootlace-thin black tie, held in place by a gold tie-clip
representing a spear. His long arms hung relaxed at his sides and
terminated in two very large hands, now slightly curled inwards,
whose backs showed black hair. His big feet, in expensive black
shoes, looked to be about size 12.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond summed him up as a tough and capable man who had
triumphed in a variety of hard schools and who looked as if he
was still serving in one of them.</p>

<p class="pindent">“. . . and these are the stones we are particularly interested
in,” concluded Sergeant Dankwaerts. He referred to his black
book. “One 20 carat Wesselton. Two Fine Blue-whites of about
10 carats each. One 30 carat Yellow Premier. One 15 carat Top
Cape and two 15 carat Cape Unions.” He paused. Then he
looked up from his book and very sharply into Mr Saye’s hard
black eyes. “Have any of those passed through your hands, Mr
Saye, or through your firm in New York?” he inquired softly.</p>

<p class="pindent">“No,” said Mr Saye flatly. “They have not.” He turned to
the door behind him and opened it. “And now, good afternoon,
gentlemen.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Without bothering any further with them he walked decisively
out of the room and they heard his footsteps go rapidly up a
few stairs. A door opened and banged shut and there was silence.</p>

<p class="pindent">Undismayed, Sergeant Dankwaerts slipped his note-book into
his waistcoat pocket, picked up his hat and walked out into the
hall and then out into the street. Bond followed him.</p>

<p class="pindent">They climbed into the patrol car and Bond gave the address
of his flat off the King’s Road. When the car was moving, Sergeant
Dankwaerts relaxed his official face. He turned to Bond.
He looked amused. “I quite enjoyed that,” he said cheerfully.
“Don’t often meet a nut as tough as that one. Did you get what
you wanted, Sir?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shrugged his shoulders. “Tell the truth, Sergeant, I didn’t
know exactly what I did want. But I was glad to get a good
look at Mr Rufus B. Saye. Quite a chap. Doesn’t look much like
my idea of a diamond merchant.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Sergeant Dankwaerts chuckled. “He’s not a diamond merchant,
Sir,” he said, “or I’ll eat my hat.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“How do you know?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“When I read out that list of missing stones,” Sergeant Dankwaerts
smiled happily, “I mentioned a Yellow Premier and two
Cape Unions.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It just happens that there aren’t such things, Sir.”</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_5">5<br class="lgl"/> <span class="gesp">“FEUILLES MORTES”</span></h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">B</span>OND felt the liftman watching him as he walked down the
long, quiet corridor to the end room, Room 350. Bond
wasn’t surprised. He knew there was more petty crime in this
hotel than in any other large hotel in London. Vallance had
once shown him the big monthly crime map of London. He had
pointed to the forest of little flags round the Trafalgar Palace.
“That place annoys the map-room men,” he had said. “Every
month this corner gets so pitted with holes they have to paste
fresh paper over it to hold the next month’s pins.”</p>

<p class="pindent">As Bond neared the end of the corridor he could hear a piano
swinging a rather sad tune. At the door of 350 he knew the
music came from behind it. He recognized the tune. It was
<span class="it">Feuilles Mortes</span>. He knocked.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Come in.” The hall porter had telephoned and the voice
was waiting for him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked into the small living-room and closed the door
behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Lock it,” said the voice. It came from the bedroom.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond did as he was told and walked across the middle of the
room until he was opposite the open bedroom door. As he passed
the portable long-player on the writing-desk the pianist began
on <span class="it">La Ronde</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">She was sitting, half naked, astride a chair in front of the
dressing-table, gazing across the back of the chair into the triple
mirror. Her bare arms were folded along the tall back of the
chair and her chin was resting on her arms. Her spine was
arched, and there was arrogance in the set of her head and
shoulders. The black string of her brassière across the naked
back, the tight black lace pants and the splay of her legs whipped
at Bond’s senses.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl raised her eyes from looking at her face and inspected
him in the mirror, briefly and coolly.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I guess you’re the new help,” she said in a low, rather husky
voice that made no commitment. “Take a seat and enjoy the
music. Best light record ever made.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was amused. He obediently took the few steps to a deep
armchair, moved it a little so that he could still see her through
the doorway, and sat down.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Do you mind if I smoke?” he said, taking out his case and
putting a cigarette in his mouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">“If that’s the way you want to die.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Miss Case resumed the silent contemplation of her face in the
mirror while the pianist played <span class="it">J’attendrai</span>. Then it was the
end of the record.</p>

<p class="pindent">Indifferently she flexed her hips back off the chair and stood
up. She half turned her head and the blonde hair that fell heavily
to the base of her neck curved with the movement and caught
the light.</p>

<p class="pindent">“If you like it, turn it over,” she said carelessly. “Be with you
in a moment.” She moved out of sight.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked over to the gramophone and picked up the
record. It was George Feyer with rhythm accompaniment. He
looked at the number and memorized it. It was Vox 500. He
examined the other side and, skipping <span class="it">La Vie en Rose</span> because
it had memories for him, put the needle down at the beginning
of <span class="it">Avril au Portugal</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">Before he left the gramophone he pulled the blotter softly
from under it and held it up to the standard lamp beside the
writing-desk. He held it sideways under the light and glanced
along it. It was unmarked. He shrugged his shoulders and
slipped it back under the machine and walked back to his chair.</p>

<p class="pindent">He thought that the music was appropriate to the girl. All
the tunes seemed to belong to her. No wonder it was her favourite
record. It had her brazen sexiness, the rough tang of her manner
and the poignancy that had been in her eyes as they had looked
moodily back at him out of the mirror.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had had no picture in his mind of the Miss Case who
was to shadow him to America. He had taken for granted that
it would be some tough, well-used slattern with dead eyes—a
hard, sullen woman who had ‘gone the route’ and whose body
was no longer of any interest to the gang she worked for. This
girl was tough all right, tough of manner, but whatever might
be the history of her body, the skin had shone with life under the
light.</p>

<p class="pindent">What was her first name? Bond got up again and walked
over to the gramophone. There was a Pan-American Airways
label attached to the grip. It said <span class="it">Miss T. Case</span>. T? Bond walked
back to his chair. Teresa? Tess? Thelma? Trudy? Tilly? None
of them seemed to fit. Surely not Trixie, or Tony or Tommy.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was still playing with the problem when she appeared
quietly in the doorway to the bedroom and stood with one elbow
resting high up against the door-jamb and her head bent sideways
on to her hand. She looked down at him reflectively.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got unhurriedly to his feet and looked back at her.</p>

<p class="pindent">She was dressed to go out except for her hat, a small black
affair that swung from her free hand. She wore a smart black
tailor-made over a deep olive-green shirt buttoned at the neck,
golden-tan nylons and black, square-toed crocodile shoes that
looked very expensive. There was a slim gold wrist-watch on a
black strap at one wrist and a heavy gold chain bracelet at the
other. One large baguette-cut diamond flared on the third finger
of her right hand and a flat pearl ear-ring in twisted gold showed
on her right ear where the heavy pale gold hair fell away from it.</p>

<p class="pindent">She was very beautiful in a devil-may-care way, as if she kept
her looks for herself and didn’t mind what men thought of them,
and there was an ironical tilt to the finely drawn eyebrows above
the wide, level, rather scornful grey eyes that seemed to say,</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sure. Come and try. But brother, you’d better be tops.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The eyes themselves had the rare quality of chatoyance. When
jewels have chatoyance the colour in the lustre changes with
movement in the light, and the colour of this girl’s eyes seemed
to vary between a light grey and a deep grey-blue.</p>

<p class="pindent">Her skin was lightly tanned and without make-up except for
a deep red on the lips, which were full and soft and rather
moody so as to give the effect of what is called ‘a sinful mouth’.
But not, thought Bond, one that often sinned—if one was to
judge by the level eyes and the hint of authority and tension
behind them.</p>

<p class="pindent">The eyes now looked impersonally into his.</p>

<p class="pindent">“So you’re Peter Franks,” she said and the voice was low and
attractive, but with a touch of condescension.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes,” he said. “And I’ve been wondering what T stands for.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She thought for a moment. “I guess you can find out at the
desk,” she said. “It stands for Tiffany.” She walked over to the
gramophone and stopped the record in the middle of <span class="it">Je n’en
connais pas la fin</span>. She turned round. “But it’s not in the public
domain,” she added coldly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shrugged his shoulders and moved over to the window-sill
and leant easily against it with his ankles crossed.</p>

<p class="pindent">His nonchalance seemed to irritate her. She sat down in front
of the writing-desk. “Now then,” she said, and her voice had
an edge to it, “Let’s get down to business. In the first place, why
did you take on this job?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Somebody died.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh.” She looked at him sharply. “They told me your line
was stealing.” She paused. “Hot blood or cold blood?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Hot blood. A fight.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“So you want to get out?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s about it. And the money.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She changed the subject. “Got a wooden leg? False teeth?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No. Everything’s real.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She frowned. “I’m always telling them to find me a man with
a wooden leg. Well, have you got any hobbies or anything?
Any ideas about where you’re going to carry the stones?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No,” said Bond. “I play cards and golf. But I thought the
handles of trunks and suitcases were good places for this sort
of stuff.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“So do the customs men,” she said dryly. She sat silent for a
moment, reflecting. Then she pulled a piece of paper and a pencil
towards her. “What sort of golf balls do you use?” she asked
unsmilingly.</p>

<p class="pindent">“They’re called Dunlop 65’s.” He was equally serious. “Maybe
you’ve got something there.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She made no comment, but wrote the name down. She looked
up. “Got a passport?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, I have,” admitted Bond. “But it’s in my real name.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh.” She was suspicious again. “And what might that be?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“James Bond.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She snorted. “Why not choose Joe Doe?” She shrugged her
shoulders. “Who cares anyway? Can you get an American visa
in two days? And a vaccination certificate?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’t see why not,” said Bond. (Q Branch would fix all
that.) “There’s nothing against me in America. Or at Criminal
Records here, for the matter of that. Under Bond, that is.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Okay,” she said. “Now listen. Immigration will need this.
You’re going over to the States to stay with a man called Tree.
Michael Tree. You’ll be staying at the Astor in New York. He’s
an American friend of yours. You met him in the war.” She
unbent minutely. “Just for the record, this man really exists.
He’ll back up your story. But he’s not generally known as
Michael. He’s known as ‘Shady’ Tree to his friends. If any,”
she added sourly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled.</p>

<p class="pindent">“He’s not as funny as he sounds,” said the girl shortly. She
opened a drawer in the desk and took out a packet of five-pound
notes with a rubber band round it. She riffled them through
and detached about half their number and put these back in the
drawer. She rolled up the rest, snapped the rubber band round
them and tossed the packet across the room to Bond. Bond leant
forward and caught it near the floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">“There’s about £500 in there,” she said. “Book yourself in at
the Ritz and give that address to Immigration. Get a good used
suitcase and put in it what you would take on a golfing holiday.
Get your golf clubs. Keep out of sight. BOAC Monarch to New
York. Thursday evening. Get a single ticket first thing tomorrow
morning. The Embassy won’t give you a visa without seeing
your ticket. Car will pick you up at the Ritz at 6.30 Thursday
evening. Driver will give you the golf balls. Put ’em in your bag.
And,” she looked him straight in the eye, “don’t think you can
go into business for yourself with this stuff. The driver will stay
alongside you until your luggage has gone out to the plane.
And I’ll be at London Airport. So no funny business. Okay?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shrugged his shoulders. “What would I do with this
kind of merchandise?” he said carelessly. “Too big for me. And
what happens the other end?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Another driver will be waiting outside the customs. He’ll tell
you what to do next. Now,” her voice was urgent, “If anything
happens at the customs, either end, you know nothing, see? You
just don’t know how the balls got into your bag. Whatever they
ask you, just go on saying, ‘By me’. Act dumb. I shall be watching.
And maybe others too. That I wouldn’t know. If they lock
you up in America, ask for the British Consul and go on asking.
You won’t get any help from us. But that’s what you’re being
paid for. Okay?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Fair enough,” said Bond. “The only person I could get into
trouble would be you.” He looked appraisingly at her. “And I
wouldn’t like that to happen.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Shucks,” she said scornfully. “You’ve got nothing on me.
Don’t worry about me, my friend. I can look after myself.” She
got up and came and stood in front of him. “And don’t ‘little
girl’ me,” she said sharply. “We’re on a job. And I can take
care of myself. You’d be surprised.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stood up and away from the window-sill. He smiled
down and into the flashing grey eyes that were now dark with
impatience. “ ‘I can do anything better than you can.’ Don’t
worry. I’ll be a credit to you. But just relax and stop being so
business-like for a minute. I’d like to see you again. Could we
meet in New York if everything goes all right?” Bond felt
treacherous as he said the words. He liked this girl. He wanted
to make friends with her. But it would be a question of using
friendship to get further up the pipeline.</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked thoughtfully at him for a moment and her eyes
gradually lost their darkness. Her sharply compressed lips relaxed
and parted a little. There was a hint of a stammer in her
voice as she answered him.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I, I . . . that is,” she brusquely turned away from him.
“Hell,” she said, but the word sounded artificial. “I’ve got
nothing on Friday night. Guess we might have dinner. ‘21’ Club
on 52nd. All the cab drivers know it. Eight o’clock. If the job
goes off okay. Suit you?” She turned back towards him and
looked at his mouth and not his eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Fine,” said Bond. He thought it was time to get out before
he made a mistake. “Now,” he said efficiently. “Is there anything
else?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No,” she said, and then sharply, as if she had just remembered
something. “What’s the time?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked at his watch. “Ten to six.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’ve got to get busy,” she said. With a movement of dismissal
she walked towards the door. Bond followed her. With
her hand on the key she turned. She looked at him, and there
was confidence and almost warmth in her eyes, “You’ll be all
right,” she said. “Just keep away from me in the plane. Don’t
panic if anything goes wrong. If you work out okay,” the patronizing
note came back to her voice, “I’ll try and get you some
more of the same sort of jobs.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thanks,” said Bond. “I’d appreciate that. I’d enjoy working
with you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">With a slight shrug of the shoulders, she opened the door and
Bond walked out into the corridor.</p>

<p class="pindent">He turned. “See you at this ‘21’ place of yours,” he said. He
wanted to say more, to find an excuse to stay with her, with this
lonely girl who played the gramophone and gazed at herself in
the mirror.</p>

<p class="pindent">But now her expression was remote. He might have been a
complete stranger. “Sure,” she said indifferently. She looked at
him once more and then she closed the door slowly but firmly
in his face.</p>

<p class="pindent">As Bond walked away down the long corridor to the lift,
the girl stood just inside the door and listened until his footsteps
had vanished. Then, with brooding eyes, she walked slowly over
to the gramophone and switched it on. She picked up the Feyer
record and searched for the groove she wanted. She put the
record on the machine and found the place with the needle. The
tune was <span class="it">Je n’en connais pas la fin</span>. She stood listening to it and
wondering about the man who had suddenly, out of the blue,
found his way into her life. God, she thought to herself with
sudden angry despair, another dam crook. Couldn’t she ever
get away from them? But when the record stopped her face was
happy, and she hummed the tune as she powdered her nose and
got ready to go out.</p>

<p class="pindent">Out on the street she paused and looked at her watch. Ten
minutes past six. Five minutes to go. She walked across Trafalgar
Square to Charing Cross Station, arranging in her mind
what she was going to say. Then she went into the station and
into one of the call-boxes she always used.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was just 6.15 when she dialled the Welbeck number. After
the usual two rings she heard the click of the automatic recorder
taking the call. For twenty seconds she heard nothing
but the sharp hiss of a needle on wax. Then the neutral voice
that was her unknown master said the one word ‘Speak’. And
then there was silence again except for the hiss of the recorder.</p>

<p class="pindent">She had long got over being flustered by the abrupt, disembodied
command. She spoke rapidly but distinctly into the black
mouthpiece. “Case to ABC. I repeat. Case to ABC.” She paused.
“Carrier is satisfactory. Says real name is James Bond and will
use that name on passport. Plays golf and will carry golf clubs.
Suggest golf balls. Uses Dunlop 65’s. All other arrangements
stand. Will call for confirmation at 1915 and 2015. That’s all.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She listened for a moment to the hiss of the recorder; then
she put down the receiver and walked back to her hotel. She
called Room Service for a large dry Martini and when it came
she sat and smoked and played the gramophone and waited for
7.15.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then, or perhaps not until she called back again at 8.15, the
neutral, muffled voice would come back at her over the telephone
wire: “ABC to Case. I repeat. ABC to Case . . .” And
then would follow her instructions.</p>

<p class="pindent">And somewhere, in some rented room in London, the hiss of
the recorder would stop as she put back the receiver. And then,
perhaps, an unknown door would close and footsteps would
softly sound on some stairs and out into an unknown street and
away.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_6">6<br class="lgl"/> <span class="gesp">IN TRANSIT</span></h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was six o’clock on Thursday evening and Bond was packing
his suitcase in his bedroom at the Ritz. It was a battered but
once expensive pigskin Revelation and its contents were appropriate
to his cover. Evening clothes; his lightweight black and
white dog-tooth suit for the country and for golf; Saxone golf
shoes; a companion to the dark blue, tropical worsted suit he
was wearing, and some white silk and dark blue Sea Island
cotton shirts with collars attached and short sleeves. Socks and
ties, some nylon underclothes, and two pairs of the long silk
pyjama coats he wore in place of two-piece pyjamas.</p>

<p class="pindent">None of these things bore, or had ever borne, any name-tags
or initials.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond completed his task and proceeded to fit his remaining
possessions, his shaving and washing gear, Tommy Armour on
<span class="it">How to Play your Best Golf all the Time</span>, and his tickets and
passport into a small attaché case, also of battered pigskin. This
had been prepared for him by Q Branch and there was a narrow
compartment under the leather at the back which contained a
silencer for his gun and thirty rounds of .25 ammunition.</p>

<p class="pindent">The telephone rang. He assumed it was the car, early at the
rendezvous, but it was the hall porter saying that there was a
representative of ‘Universal Export’ with a letter to be delivered
personally to Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Send him up,” said Bond, wondering.</p>

<p class="pindent">A few minutes later he opened the door to a man in plain
clothes whom he recognized as one of the messengers from
the pool at Headquarters.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Good evening, Sir,” said the man. He took a large plain
envelope out of his breast pocket and handed it to Bond. “I am
to wait and take this back when you have read it, Sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond opened the white envelope and broke the seal of the
blue envelope which it contained.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a page of blue typewritten foolscap paper with no
address and no signature. Bond recognized the extra-large type
used in M’s personal communications.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond waved the messenger to a chair and sat down at the
writing desk opposite the window.</p>

<div class="blockquoter">

<p class="pindent1">Washington [said the memorandum] reports that Rufus B. Saye
is an alias for Jack Spang, a suspected gangster who was mentioned
in the Kefauver Report but who has no criminal record.
He is, however, twin brother to Seraffimo Spang and joint controller
of the ‘Spangled Mob’ which operates widely in the United
States. The brothers Spang bought control of the House of
Diamonds five years ago ‘as an investment’, and nothing unfavourable
is known about this business, which appears to be perfectly
legitimate.</p>

<p class="pindent1">The brothers also own a ‘wire service’ which serves off-the-course
bookmakers in Nevada and California, and is, therefore,
illegal. The name of this is the Sure Fire Wire Service. They also
own the Tiara Hotel in Las Vegas, and this is the headquarters of
Seraffimo Spang and also, to benefit from the Nevada tax laws,
the company offices of the House of Diamonds.</p>

<p class="pindent1">Washington adds that the Spangled Mob is interested in other
illegal activities such as narcotics and organized prostitution, and
these lines are handled from New York by Michael (Shady) Tree
who has five previous convictions for various offences. The gang
has branch headquarters in Miami, Detroit and Chicago.</p>

<p class="pindent1">Washington describes the Spangled Mob as one of the most
powerful gangs in the United States with excellent protection in
State and Federal governments and with the police. With the
Cleveland Outfit and the Detroit ‘Purple’ gang, the Spangled Mob
has top classification.</p>

<p class="pindent1">Our interest in these matters has not been divulged to Washington,
but in the event that your inquiries lead you into dangerous
contact with this gang, you will report at once and be withdrawn
from the case which will then be handed over to the FBI.</p>

<p class="pindent1">This is an order.</p>

<p class="pindent1">The return of this document in a sealed envelope will acknowledge
your receipt of this order.</p>

</div>

<p class="pindent">There was no signature. Bond ran his eyes down the page
again, folded it, and placed it in one of the Ritz envelopes.</p>

<p class="pindent">He got up and handed the envelope to the messenger.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thanks very much,” he said. “Can you find your own way
downstairs?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, thank you, Sir,” said the messenger. He went to the
door and opened it. “Good night, Sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Good night.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The door closed quietly. Bond walked across the room to the
window and looked out over Green Park.</p>

<p class="pindent">For a moment he had a clear vision of the spare, elderly figure
sitting back in his chair in the quiet office.</p>

<p class="pindent">Give the case to the FBI? Bond knew M meant it, but he also
knew how bitter it would be for M to have to ask Edgar Hoover
to take a case over from the Secret Service and pick Britain’s
chestnuts out of the fire.</p>

<p class="pindent">The operative words in the memorandum were ‘dangerous
contact’. What constituted ‘dangerous contact’ would be a matter
for Bond to decide. Compared with some of the opposition
he had been up against, these hoodlums surely wouldn’t count
for much. Or would they? Bond suddenly remembered the
chunky, quartz-like face of Rufus B. Saye. Well, at any rate it
could do no harm to try and get a look at this brother with the
exotic name. Seraffimo. The name of a night-club waiter or an
ice-cream vendor. But these people were like that. Cheap and
theatrical.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shrugged his shoulders. He glanced at his watch. 6.25.
He looked round the room. Everything was ready. On an impulse,
he put his right hand under his coat and drew the .25 Beretta
automatic with the skeleton grip out of the chamois leather
holster that hung just below his left armpit. It was the new gun
M had given him ‘as a memento’ after his last assignment, with
a note in M’s green ink that had said, <span class="it">You may need this</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked over to the bed, snapped out the magazine, and
pumped the single round in the chamber out on to the bedspread.
He worked the action several times and sensed the tension
on the trigger spring as he squeezed and fired the empty
gun. He pulled back the breech and verified that there was no
dust round the pin which he had spent so many hours filing to
a point, and he ran his hand down the blue barrel from the tip
of which he had personally sawn the blunt foresight. Then he
snapped the spare round back into the magazine, and the magazine
into the taped butt of the thin gun, pumped the action for
a last time, put up the safe and slipped the gun back under his
coat.</p>

<p class="pindent">The telephone rang. “Your car’s here, Sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond put down the receiver. So here it was. The ‘off’. He
walked thoughtfully over to the window and looked out again
across the green trees. He felt a slight emptiness in the stomach,
a sudden pang at cutting the painter with those green trees that
were London in high summer, and a loneliness at the thought
of the big building in Regent’s Park, the fortress which would
now be out of reach except to a call for help which he knew it
would not be in him to make.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a knock on the door and, when a page came in for
his bags, Bond followed him out of the room and along the
corridor, and his mind was swept clean of everything except
what waited at the mouth of the pipeline that lay open for him
outside the swing-doors of the Ritz Hotel.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a black Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire with red trade
plates. “You’d like to sit up front,” said the uniformed chauffeur.
It was not an invitation. Bond’s two bags and his golf clubs were
put in the back. He settled himself comfortably and, as they
turned into Piccadilly, he examined the face of the driver. All
he could see was a hard, anonymous profile under a peaked cap.
The eyes were concealed behind black sun goggles. The hands
that expertly used the wheel and the gears wore leather gloves.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Just relax and enjoy the ride, Mister.” The accent was
Brooklyn. “Don’t bother with conversation. Makes me nervous.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled and said nothing. He did as he was told. Forty,
he thought. Twelve stone. Five feet ten. Expert driver. Very
familiar with London traffic. No smell of tobacco. Expensive
shoes. Neat dresser. No five o’clock shadow. Query shaves twice
a day with electric razor.</p>

<p class="pindent">After the roundabout at the end of the Great West Road, the
driver pulled in to the side. He opened the glove compartment
and carefully removed six new Dunlop 65’s in their black wrapping
paper, and with the seals intact. Leaving the engine idling
in neutral, he got out of the front seat and opened the rear door.
Bond looked over his shoulder and watched the man unstrap
the ball-pocket on his golf bag and, one by one, carefully add
the six new balls to the miscellaneous old and new ones the
pocket already contained. Then, without a word, the man
climbed back into the front seat and the drive continued.</p>

<p class="pindent">At London Airport, Bond unconcernedly went through the
luggage and ticket routine, bought himself the <span class="it">Evening Standard</span>,
allowing his arm, as he put down his pennies, to brush against
an attractive blonde in a tan travelling suit who was idly turning
the pages of a magazine and, accompanied by the driver, followed
his luggage through to the customs.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Just your personal effects, Sir?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“And how much English money have you, Sir?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“About three pounds and some silver.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thank you, Sir.” The blue chalk made a scribble on the
three bags, and the porter picked up the suitcase and clubs and
loaded them on a trolley. “Follow the yellow light to Immigration,
Sir,” he said and wheeled the trolley off towards the loading
bay.</p>

<p class="pindent">The driver gave Bond an ironical salute. The smudge of two
eyes met his for a moment through the dark glass of the goggles
and the lips narrowed in a thin smile. “Good night, Sir. Pleasant
trip.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thank you, my man,” said Bond cheerfully, and had the
satisfaction of seeing the smile vanish as the driver turned and
walked quickly away.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond picked up his attaché case, showed his passport to a
pleasant, fresh-faced young man who ticked his name off the
passenger list, and walked through into the Departure Lounge.
Just behind him, he heard Tiffany Case’s low voice say “Thank
you” to the fresh-faced young man, and a moment later she also
came into the lounge and chose a seat between him and the door.
Bond smiled to himself. It was where he would have chosen to
sit if he had been tailing someone who might have second
thoughts.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond picked up his <span class="it">Evening Standard</span> and casually examined
the other passengers over the top of it.</p>

<p class="pindent">The plane would be nearly full (Bond had been too late to get
a sleeping berth) and he was relieved to see that among the forty
people in the lounge there was not a face he recognized. Some
miscellaneous English, two of the usual nuns who, Bond reflected,
seemed always to be flying the Atlantic in the summer—Lourdes,
perhaps—some nondescript Americans, mostly of the
businessman type, two babies in arms to keep the passengers
from sleeping, and a handful of indeterminate Europeans. A
typical load, decided Bond, while admitting that if two of their
number, himself and Tiffany Case, had their secrets, there was
no reason why many of these dull people should not also be
bound on strange missions.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond felt that he was being watched, but it was only the blank
gaze of two of the passengers he had put down as American
businessmen. Their eyes shifted casually away, and one of them,
a man with a young face but prematurely white hair, said something
to the other and they both got up, picked up their Stetsons,
which, although it was summer, were encased in waterproof
covers, and walked over to the bar. Bond heard them order
double brandies and water, and the second man, who was pale
and fat, took a bottle of pills out of his pocket and swallowed
one down with his brandy. Dramamine, guessed Bond. The man
would be a bad traveller.</p>

<p class="pindent">The BOAC flight dispatcher was close to Bond. She picked
up the telephone—to Flight Control, Bond supposed—and said
“I have forty passengers in the Final Lounge”. She waited for
the okay and then put the telephone back and picked up the
microphone.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Final Lounge?” Cheerful start to flying the Atlantic, reflected
Bond, and then they were all walking across the tarmac and
up into the big Boeing and, with a burst of oil and metanol
smoke, the engines fired one by one. The chief steward
announced over the loudspeaker that the next stop would be
Shannon, where they would dine, and that the flying time
would be one hour and fifty minutes, and the great double-decker
Stratocruiser rolled slowly out to the East-West runway.
The aircraft trembled against its brakes as the Captain revved
the four engines, one at a time, up to take-off speed, and through
his window Bond watched the wing flaps being tested. Then
the great plane turned slowly towards the setting sun, there was
a jerk as the brakes were released and the grass on either side of
the runway flattened as, gathering speed, the Monarch hurtled
down the two miles of stressed concrete and rose into the west,
aiming ultimately for another little strip of concrete carpet on
the other side of the world.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond lit a cigarette and was settling himself with his book
when the back of the reclining seat on the left of the pair in front
of him was lowered sharply towards him. It was one of the two
American businessmen, the fat one, lying slumped down with
his safety belt still fastened round his stomach. His face was
green and sweating. He held a brief-case clutched across his
chest and Bond could read the name on the visiting card inserted
in the leather label tag. It said <span class="it">Mr W. Winter</span> and below,
in neat red ink capitals, was written <span class="calibre3">MY BLOOD GROUP IS F</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">Poor brute, thought Bond. He’s terrified. He knows the plane
is going to crash. He just hopes the men who pull him out of
the wreckage will give him the right blood transfusion. To him
this plane is nothing but a giant tube—full of anonymous deadweight,
supported in the air by a handful of sparking plugs, and
guided to its destination by a scrap of electricity. He has no faith
in it, and no faith in safety statistics. He is suffering the same
fears he had as a small child—the fear of noise and the fear of
falling. He won’t even dare to go to the lavatory for fear he’ll
put his foot through the floor of the plane when he stands up.</p>

<p class="pindent">A silhouette broke the rays of the evening sun that filled the
cabin and Bond glanced away from the man. It was Tiffany
Case. She walked past him to the stairs leading down to the
cocktail lounge on the lower deck and disappeared. Bond would
have liked to follow her. He shrugged his shoulders and waited
for the steward to wheel round the tray of cocktails and the
caviar and smoked salmon canapés. He turned again to his book
and read a page without understanding a single word. He put
the girl out of his mind and started the page again.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had read a quarter of the book when he felt his ears
begin to block as the plane started its fifty-mile descent towards
the western coastline of Ireland. “Fasten your seat-belts. No
smoking” and there was the green-and-white searchlight of
Shannon and the red and gold of the flare-path rushing towards
them, and then the brilliant blue of the ground-lights between
which the Stratocruiser trundled towards the unloading bay.
Steak and champagne for dinner, and the wonderful goblet of
hot coffee laced with Irish whisky and topped with half an inch
of thick cream. A glance at the junk in the airport shops, the
‘Irish Horn Rosaries’, the ‘Bog Oak Irish Harp’, and the ‘Brass
Leprechauns’, all at $1.50, and the ghastly ‘Irish Musical Cottage’
at $4, the furry, unwearable tweeds and the dainty Irish
linen doilies and cocktail napkins. And then the Irish rigmarole
coming over the loudspeaker in which only the words ‘BOAC’
and ‘New York’ were comprehensible, the translation into English,
the last look at Europe, and they were climbing to 15,000
feet and heading for their next contact with the surface of the
world, the radio beacons on the weather ships <span class="it">Jig</span> and <span class="it">Charlie</span>,
marking time around their compass points somewhere in the
middle of the Atlantic.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond slept well and awoke only as they were approaching the
southern shores of Nova Scotia. He went forward to the wash-room
and shaved, and gargled away the taste of a night of pressurized
air, and then he went back to his seat between the lines
of crumpled, stirring passengers and had his usual moment of
exhilaration as the sun came up over the rim of the world and
bathed the cabin in blood.</p>

<p class="pindent">Slowly, with the dawn, the plane came alive. Twenty thousand
feet below, the houses began to show like grains of sugar spilt
across a brown carpet. Nothing moved on the earth’s surface
except a thin worm of smoke from a train, the straight white
feather of a fishing boat’s wake across an inlet, and the glint of
chromium from a toy motor car caught in the sun; but Bond
could almost see the sleeping humps under the bedclothes beginning
to stir and, where there was a wisp of smoke rising into the
still morning air, he could smell the coffee brewing in the
kitchens.</p>

<p class="pindent">Breakfast came, that inappropriate assortment of foods that
BOAC advertise as ‘An English country house breakfast’, and
the chief steward came round with the US customs forms—Form
No 6063 of the Treasury Department—and Bond read the
small print: <span class="it">failure to declare any article or any wilfully false
statement . . . fine or imprisonment or both</span> and wrote <span class="it">Personal
effects</span> and cheerfully signed the lie.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then there were three hours when the plane hung dead-steady
in the middle of the world, and only the patches of
bright sunshine swaying slowly a few inches up and down the
walls of the cabin gave a sense of motion. But at last there was
the great sprawl of Boston below them, and then the bold pattern
of a clover-leaf on the New Jersey Turnpike, and Bond’s
ears began to block with the slow descent towards the pall of
haze that was the suburbs of New York. There was the hiss and
sickly smell of the insecticide bomb, the shrill hydraulic whine
of the air-brakes and the landing-wheels being lowered, the dip
of the plane’s nose, the tearing bump of the tyres on the runway,
the ugly roar as the screws were reversed to slow the plane for
the entrance bay, the rumbling progress over the tired grass
plain towards the tarmac apron, the clang of the hatch being
opened, and they were there.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_7">7<br class="lgl"/> <span class="gesp">‘SHADY’ TREE</span></h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE customs officer, a paunchy good-living man with dark
sweat marks at the armpits of his grey uniform shirt, sauntered
lazily over from the Supervisor’s desk to where Bond stood,
his three pieces of luggage in front of him, under the letter B.
Next door, under C, the girl took a packet of Parliaments out of
her bag and put a cigarette between her lips. Bond heard several
impatient clicks at the lighter, and the sharper snap as she put
the lighter back in her bag and closed the fastening. Bond felt
aware of her watchfulness. He wished that her name began with
Z so that she would not be so close. Zarathustra? Zacharias?
Zophany. . . . ?</p>

<p class="pindent">“Mr Bond?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Is this your signature?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Just your personal effects?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, that’s all.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Okay, Mr Bond.” The man tore a customs stamp out of his
book and pasted it on the suitcase. He did the same for the
attaché case. He came to the golf clubs. He paused with the
stamp book in his hand. He looked up at Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">“What d’ya shoot, Mr Bond?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had a moment of blackout.</p>

<p class="pindent">“They’re golf clubs.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sure,” said the man patiently. “But what d’ya shoot? What
d’ya go round in?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond could have kicked himself for forgetting the Americanism.
“Oh, in the middle eighties, I guess.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Never broken a hundred in my life,” said the customs officer.
He gummed a blessed stamp on the side of the bag a few inches
away from the richest haul of contraband that had ever been
missed at Idlewild.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Have a good vacation, Mr Bond.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thanks,” said Bond. He beckoned a porter and followed his
bags across to the last hurdle, the Inspector at the door. There
was no pause. The man bent over, searched for the stamps, overstamped
them and waved him through.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Mr Bond?”</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a tall, hatchet-faced man with mud-coloured hair and
mean eyes. He was wearing dark brown slacks and a coffee-coloured
shirt.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I have a car for you.” As he turned and led the way out into
the hot early morning sun, Bond noticed a square bulge in his
hip-pocket. It was about the shape of a small-calibre automatic.
Typical, thought Bond. Mike Hammer routine. These American
gangsters were too obvious. They had read too many horror-comics
and seen too many films.</p>

<p class="pindent">The car was a black Oldsmobile Sedan. Bond didn’t wait to
be told. He climbed into the front seat, leaving the disposal of
his luggage in the back and the tipping of the porter to the man
in brown. When they had left the cheerless prairie of Idlewild
and had merged into the stream of commuter traffic on the Van
Wyck Parkway, he felt he ought to say something.</p>

<p class="pindent">“How’s the weather been over here?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The driver didn’t take his eyes off the road. “Either side of a
hundred.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s pretty hot,” said Bond. “We haven’t had it much over
seventy-five in London.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That so?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What’s the programme now?” asked Bond after a pause.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man glanced in his driving mirror and pulled into the
centre lane. For a quarter of a mile he busied himself with
passing a bunch of slow-moving cars on the inside lanes. They
came to an empty stretch of road. Bond repeated his question.
“I said, what’s the programme?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The driver gave him a quick glance. “Shady wants you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Does he?” said Bond. He was suddenly impatient with these
people. He wondered how soon he would be able to throw some
weight about. The prospect didn’t look good. His job was to
stay in the pipeline and follow it farther. Any sign of independence
or non-co-operation and he would be discarded. He would
have to make himself small and stay that way. He would just
have to get used to the idea.</p>

<p class="pindent">They swept into up-town Manhattan and followed the river as
far as the forties. Then they cut across town and pulled up half
way down West 46th Street, the Hatton Garden of New York.
The driver double-parked outside an inconspicuous doorway.
Their destination was sandwiched between a grubby-looking
shop selling costume jewellery and an elegant shop-front faced
with black marble. The silver italic lettering above the black
marble entrance of the elegant shop-front was so discreet that if
the name had not been in the back of Bond’s mind he would not
have been able to decipher it from where he sat. It said ‘The
House of Diamonds, Inc.’.</p>

<p class="pindent">As the car stopped, a man stepped off the pavement and sauntered
round the car. “Everything okay?” he said to the driver.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sure. Boss in?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yeah. Want me to park the heap?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Be glad if you would.” The driver turned to Bond. “This is
it, bud. Let’s get the bags out.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got out and opened the rear door. He picked up his
small attaché case and reached for the golf clubs.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’ll take the sticks,” said the driver behind him. Obediently
Bond hauled out his suitcase. The driver reached in for the clubs
and slammed the door of the car. The other man was already
in the driver’s seat and the car moved off into the traffic as Bond
followed the driver across the sidewalk and through the inconspicuous
door.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a man in a porter’s lodge in the small hallway. As
they came in, he looked up from the sports section of <span class="it">The News</span>.
“Hi,” he said to the driver. He looked sharply at Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Hi,” said the driver. “Mind if we leave the bags with you?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Go ahead,” said the man. “Be okay in here.” He jerked his
head back.</p>

<p class="pindent">The driver, with Bond’s clubs over his shoulder, waited for
Bond beside the doors of an elevator across the hall. When Bond
followed him inside, he pressed the button for the fourth floor
and they rode up in silence. They emerged into another small
hallway. It contained two chairs, a table, a large brass spittoon
and a smell of stale heat.</p>

<p class="pindent">They crossed the frayed carpet to a glass-fronted door and the
driver knocked and walked through without waiting for an
answer. Bond followed him and shut the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">A man with very bright red hair and a big peaceful moon-shaped
face was sitting at a desk. There was a glass of milk in
front of him. He stood up as they came in and Bond saw he
was a hunchback. Bond didn’t remember having seen a red-haired
hunchback before. He could imagine that the combination
would be useful for frightening the small fry who worked for
the gang.</p>

<p class="pindent">The hunchback moved slowly round the desk and over to
where Bond was standing. He walked round Bond, making a
show of examining him minutely from head to foot, and then he
came and stood close in front of Bond and looked up into his
face. Bond looked impassively back into a pair of china eyes that
were so empty and motionless that they might have been hired
from a taxidermist. Bond had the feeling that he was being subjected
to some sort of test. Casually he looked back at the hunchback,
noting the big ears with rather exaggerated lobes, the dry
red lips of the big half-open mouth, the almost complete absence
of a neck, and the short powerful arms in the expensive yellow
silk shirt, cut to make room for the barrel-like chest and its sharp
hump.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I like to have a good look at the people we employ, Mr
Bond.” The voice was sharp and pitched high.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled politely.</p>

<p class="pindent">“London tells me you have killed a man. I believe them. I can
see you are capable of it. Would you like to do more work for
us?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It depends what it is,” said Bond. “Or rather,” he hoped he
was not being too theatrical, “how much you pay.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The hunchback gave a short squeal of laughter. He turned
abruptly to the driver. “Rocky, get those balls out of the bag and
cut them open. Here”; he gave a quick shake of his right arm
and held his open hand out to the driver. On it lay a double-bladed
knife with a flat handle bound with adhesive tape. Bond
recognized it as a throwing knife. He had to admit that the bit
of legerdemain had been neatly executed.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, boss,” said the driver, and Bond noticed the alacrity
with which he took the knife and knelt on the floor to unstrap
the ball-pocket of the golf bag.</p>

<p class="pindent">The hunchback walked away from Bond and back to his
chair. He sat down and picked up the glass of milk. He looked
at it with distaste and swallowed the contents in two huge gulps.
He looked at Bond as if for comment.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Ulcers?” asked Bond sympathetically.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Who spoke to you?” said the hunchback angrily. His anger
was transferred to the driver. “What are you waiting for, Rocky?
Put those balls on the table where I can see what you’re doing.
The number on the ball is the centre of the plug. Dig ’em out.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Coming, boss,” said the driver. He stood up from the floor
and put the six new balls on the desk. Five of them were still in
their black wrapping. He took the sixth and turned it round in
his fingers. Then he picked up the knife and dug its point into
the cover of the ball and levered. A half-inch circular section of
the ball came away on the tip of the blade and he passed the
ball across the desk to the hunchback, who tipped the contents,
three uncut stones of ten to fifteen carats, on to the leather surface
of the desk.</p>

<p class="pindent">The hunchback moodily poked the stones with his finger.</p>

<p class="pindent">The driver went on with his work until Bond counted
eighteen stones on the table. They were unimpressive in their
rough state but if they were of top quality Bond could easily
believe they might be worth £100,000 after cutting.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Okay, Rocky,” said the hunchback. “Eighteen. That’s the
lot. Now get those goddam golf-sticks out of here and send the
boy to the Astor with them and this guy’s bags. He’s registered
there. Have them sent up to his room. Okay?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Okay, boss.” The driver left the knife and the empty golf
balls on the table, strapped up the ball-pocket on Bond’s bag,
hoisted the bag on his shoulder and left the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond went over to a chair against the wall, pulled it over to
face the hunchback across the desk and sat down. He took a
cigarette and lit it. He looked across at the hunchback and said
“And now, if you’re happy, I’d be glad of those $5000.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The hunchback, who had been carefully watching Bond’s
movements, lowered his eyes to the untidy pile of diamonds in
front of him. He poked them into a circle. Then he looked up
at Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You will be paid in full, Mr Bond,” the high voice was precise
and business-like. “And you may get more than $5000. But
the method of payment will be devised as much for your protection
as for ours. There will be no direct payment. And you
will understand why, Mr Bond, because you will have made
pay-offs during your career of burglary. It is very dangerous for
a man suddenly to be flush with money. He talks about it. He
throws it around. And if the cops catch up with him and ask
him where it all came from he hasn’t got an answer. Agree?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes,” said Bond surprised by the sanity and authority of
what the man was saying. “That makes sense.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“So,” said the hunchback, “I and my friends pay only very
seldom and in small amounts for services rendered. Instead, we
arrange for the guy to make the money on his own account.
Take yourself. How much money have you got in your pocket?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“About three pounds and some silver,” said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">“All right,” said the hunchback. “Today you met your friend
Mr Tree.” He pointed a finger at his chest. “Which is me. A
perfectly respectable citizen whom you knew in England in 1945
when he was concerned with the disposal of Army surplus
goods. Remember?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I owed you $500 for a bridge game we had at the Savoy.
Remember?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond nodded.</p>

<p class="pindent">“When we meet today I toss you double or quits for it. And
you win. Okay? So you now have $1000 and I, a tax-paying citizen,
will support your story. Here is the money.” The hunchback
took a wallet out of his hip-pocket and pushed ten $100
bills across the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond picked them up and put them casually in the pocket of
his coat.</p>

<p class="pindent">“And then,” continued the hunchback, “you say you’d like to
see some horse-racing while you’re over here. So I say to you
‘Why not go and take a look at Saratoga? The meeting begins
on Monday.’ And you say okay, and you go on up to Saratoga,
with your thousand bucks in your pocket. Okay?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Fine,” said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">“And you back a horse there. And it pays off at least fives.
So you have your $5000 and if anybody asks where it came
from, you earned it and you can prove it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What if the horse loses?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It won’t.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond made no comment. So he was getting somewhere already—into
the gangster world with a bang. The racing end of it. He
looked across into the pale china eyes. It was impossible to tell
whether they were receptive. They stared blankly back at him.
But now for the big step through the cut-out.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, that’s fine,” said Bond, hoping that flattery was the
key. “You people certainly seem to think things out. I like working
for careful people.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was no encouragement in the china eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’d like to stay away from England for a bit. I suppose you
couldn’t do with an extra hand?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The china eyes shifted away from his and inched reflectively
over Bond’s face and shoulders as if the hunchback was judging
horseflesh. Then the man looked down at the circle of diamonds
in front of him and carefully, thoughtfully, poked it into a
square.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was silence in the room. Bond looked at his fingernails.</p>

<p class="pindent">At last the hunchback looked up at him again. “Could be,”
he said thoughtfully. “Could be there’d be something else for
you. You made no mistakes so far. You go on that way and keep
your nose clean. Call me up after the race and I’ll tell you what
the word is. But, like I said, just take it easy and do what you’re
told. Okay?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s muscles relaxed. He shrugged his shoulders. “Why
should I get out of line? I’m looking for a job. And you can tell
your outfit that I’m not particular so long as the pay’s good.”</p>

<p class="pindent">For the first time the china eyes showed emotion. They looked
hurt and angry and Bond wondered if he had overplayed.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Who d’you think we are?” the hunchback’s voice rose to an
indignant squeak. “Some sort of a cheap crook outfit? Well,
hell.” He shrugged his shoulders resignedly. “Can’t expect a
Limey to understand the way things are over here these days.”
The eyes went dull again. “Now listen to what I say. This is my
number. Put it down. Wisconsin 7-3697. And write this down,
too. But keep it to yourself or you may get your tongue cut out.”
Shady Tree’s short, shrill laugh was not merry. “Fourth race on
Tuesday. The Perpetuities Stakes. Mile and a quarter for Three
Year Olds. And put your money on just before the windows
close. You’ll shift the odds with that Grand of yours. Okay?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Okay,” said Bond, a pencil poised obediently over his note-book.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Right,” said the hunchback. “Shy Smile. Big horse with a
blaze face and four white stockings. And play him to win.”</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_8">8<br class="lgl"/> <span class="gesp">THE EYE THAT NEVER SLEEPS</span></h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>T was 12.30 when Bond went down in the elevator and out
on to the roasting street.</p>

<p class="pindent">He turned right and walked slowly down towards Times
Square. As he passed the handsome black marble frontage of the
House of Diamonds, he stopped to examine the two discreet
show-windows lined with dark blue velvet. In the centre of each
there was just one piece of jewellery, an ear-ring consisting of a
big pear-shaped diamond hanging from another perfect stone,
circular and brilliant-cut. Below each ear-ring there was a thin
plate of yellow gold, in the shape of a visiting card with one
edge turned down. On each plate was engraved the words
<span class="it">Diamonds are Forever</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled to himself. He wondered which of his predecessors
had smuggled those four diamonds into America.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sauntered on in search of an air-conditioned bar where
he could get out of the heat and do some thinking. He was
pleased with his interview. At least it hadn’t been the brush-off
he had more than half expected. He was amused by the hunchback.
There was something splendidly theatrical about him, and
his vanity about the Spangled Mob was appealing. But he wasn’t
at all funny.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had walked for only a few minutes when it suddenly
occurred to him that he was being followed. There was no evidence
for it except a slight tingling of the scalp and an extra
awareness of the people near him, but he had faith in his sixth
sense and he at once stopped in front of the shop window he
was passing and looked casually back along 46th Street. Nothing
but a lot of miscellaneous people moving slowly on the sidewalks,
mostly on the same side as himself, the side that was sheltered
from the sun. There was no sudden movement into a doorway,
nobody casually wiping his face with a handkerchief to avoid
recognition, nobody bending down to tie a shoelace.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond examined the Swiss watches in his shop window and
then turned and sauntered on. After a few yards he stopped
again. Still nothing. He went on and turned right into the
Avenue of the Americas, stopping in the first doorway, the
entrance to a women’s underwear store where a man in a tan
suit with his back to him was examining the black lace pants on
a particularly realistic dummy. Bond turned and leant against a
pillar and gazed lazily but watchfully out into the street.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then something gripped his pistol arm and a voice
snarled: “All right, Limey. Take it easy unless you want lead
for lunch,” and he felt something press into his back just above
the kidneys.</p>

<p class="pindent">What was there familiar about that voice? The Law? The
Gang? Bond glanced down to see what was holding his right
arm. It was a steel hook. Well, if the man had only one arm!
Like lightning he swivelled, bending sideways and bringing his
left fist round in a flailing blow, low down.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a smack as his fist was caught in the other man’s
left hand, and, at the same time as the contact telegraphed to
Bond’s mind that there could have been no gun, there came the
well-remembered laugh and the lazy voice saying: “No good,
James. The angels have got you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond straightened himself slowly and for a moment he could
only gaze into the grinning hawk-like face of Felix Leiter with
blank disbelief, his built-up tension slowly relaxing.</p>

<p class="pindent">“So you were doing a front tail, you lousy bastard,” he finally
said. He looked with delight at the friend he had last seen as a
cocoon of dirty bandages on a bloodstained bed in a Florida
hotel, the American secret agent with whom he had shared so
many adventures. “What the hell are you doing here? And what
the hell do you mean playing the bloody fool in this heat?” Bond
took out a handkerchief and wiped it over his face. “For a
moment you almost made me nervous.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Nervous!” Felix Leiter laughed scornfully. “You were saying
your prayers. And your conscience is so bad you didn’t even
know if you were going to get it from the cops or the gang.
Right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed and dodged the question. “Come on, you
crooked spy,” he said. “You can buy me a drink and tell me all
about it. I just don’t believe in odds as long as this. In fact, you
can buy me lunch. You Texans are lousy with money.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sure,” said Leiter. He slipped his steel hook into the right-hand
pocket of his coat and took Bond’s arm with his left hand.
They moved out on to the street and Bond noticed that Leiter
walked with a heavy limp. “In Texas even the fleas are so rich
they can hire themselves dogs. Let’s go. Sardi’s is just over the
way.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter avoided the fashionable room at the famous actors’ and
writers’ eating house and led Bond upstairs. His limp was more
noticeable and he held on to the banisters. Bond made no comment,
but when he left his friend at a corner table in the blessedly
air-conditioned restaurant and went off to the wash-room to clean
himself up, he added up his impressions. The right arm had
gone, and the left leg, and there were imperceptible scars below
the hairline above the right eye that suggested a good deal of
grafting, but otherwise Leiter looked in good shape. The grey
eyes were undefeated, the shock of straw-coloured hair had no
hint of grey in it, and there was none of the bitterness of a
cripple in Leiter’s face. But in their short walk there had been a
hint of reticence in Leiter’s manner and Bond felt this had something
to do with him, Bond, and perhaps with Leiter’s present
activities. Certainly not, he thought as he walked across the room
to join his friend, with Leiter’s injuries.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a medium dry Martini with a piece of lemon peel
waiting for him. Bond smiled at Leiter’s memory and tasted it.
It was excellent, but he didn’t recognize the Vermouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Made with Cresta Blanca,” explained Leiter. “New domestic
brand from California. Like it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Best Vermouth I ever tasted.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“And I’ve taken a chance and ordered you smoked salmon
and Brizzola,” said Leiter. “They’ve got some of the finest meat
in America here, and Brizzola’s the best cut of that. Beef,
straight-cut across the bone. Roast and then broiled. Suit you?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Anything you say,” said Bond. “We’ve eaten enough meals
together to know each other’s tastes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’ve told them not to hurry,” said Leiter. He rapped on the
table with his hook. “We’ll have another Martini first and while
you drink it you’d better come clean.” There was warmth in his
smile, but his eyes were watching Bond. “Just tell me one thing.
What business have you got with my old friend Shady Tree?”
He gave his order to the waiter and sat forward in his chair and
waited.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond finished his first Martini and lit a cigarette. He swivelled
casually in his chair. The tables near them were empty. He
turned back and faced the American.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You tell me something first, Felix,” he said softly. “Who are
you working for these days? Still the CIA?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Nix,” said Leiter. “With my gun hand gone they could only
offer me desk work. Very nice about it and paid me off handsomely
when I said I wanted an open-air life. So Pinkerton’s
made me a good offer. You know, ‘The Eye that Never Sleeps’
people. So now I’m just a ‘door-basher’—private detective. ‘Put
on some clothes and open up’ routine. But it’s good fun. They’re
a nice crowd to work with, and one day I’ll be able to retire with
a pension and a presentation gold watch that goes green in summer.
As a matter of fact I’m in charge of their Race Gang squad—doping,
crooked running, night-guards at the stables, all that
sort of thing. Good job, and it takes you all over the country.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sounds all right,” said Bond. “But I didn’t know you knew
anything about horses.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Usen’t to be able to recognize a horse unless there was a milk-wagon
tied on behind,” admitted Leiter. “But you soon pick it
up, and it’s mostly the people you have to know about, not the
horses. What about you?” He lowered his voice. “Still with the
Old Firm?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s right,” said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">“On a job for them now?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Undercover?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter sighed. He sipped his Martini reflectively. “Well,” he
said finally. “You’re a dam fool to be operating alone if it’s anything
to do with the Spangled boys. In fact, you’re such a bad
risk I’m crazy even to be having lunch with you. But I’ll tell
you why I was gumshoeing around Shady’s neck of the woods
this morning and maybe we can help each other. Without involving
our outfits, of course. Okay?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You know I’d like to work with you, Felix,” said Bond seriously.
“But I’m still working for the Government while you’re
probably in competition with yours. But if it turns out our target’s
the same, there’s no sense in getting wires crossed. If we’re
chasing the same hare, I’ll be happy to run with you. Now,”
Bond looked quizzically at the Texan. “Am I right in thinking
you’re interested in someone with a blaze face and four white
stockings? Called Shy Smile?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s right,” said Leiter, not particularly surprised. “Running
at Saratoga on Tuesday. And what might the running of
this horse have to do with the security of the British Empire?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’ve been told to back him,” said Bond. “One thousand
dollars to win. Pay-off for another job.” Bond lifted up his cigarette
and his hand covered his mouth. “I brought £100,000 worth
of uncut diamonds in by plane this morning for Mr Spang and
his friends.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter’s eyes narrowed. He gave a low whistle of surprise.
“Boy!” he said respectfully. “You’re certainly in a bigger league
than me. I’m only interested because Shy Smile is a ringer. The
horse that’s due to win on Tuesday won’t be Shy Smile at all.
Shy Smile wasn’t even placed the last three times he ran. And
anyway they’ve shot him. It’ll be a very fast job called Pickapepper.
Just by chance he’s got a blaze face and four white
stockings, too. Big chestnut, and they’ve done a good job with
his hooves and various other small points of difference. They’ve
been getting this job ready for over a year. Out in the desert in
Nevada, where the Spangs have some sort of a ranch. And are
they going to clean up! It’s a big race, with $25,000 added. And
you can bet they’ll plaster the country with their money just
before the off. Can’t fail to be better than Fives. More like Ten
or Fifteen to One. They’ll make a packet.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“But I thought all horses in America had to have their lips
tattooed,” said Bond. “How have they got round that?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Grafted new skin on to Pickapepper’s mouth. Copied Shy
Smile’s marks on it. This tattoo gimmick is getting old-fashioned.
The word in Pinkerton’s is that the Jockey Club are going to
change to photos of the night eyes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What are night eyes?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“They’re those calluses on the inside of a horse’s knees. The
English call them ‘chestnuts’. Seems they’re different on every
horse. Like a man’s fingerprints. But it’ll be the same old story.
They’ll photo the night eyes on every racehorse in America and
then find the gangs have dreamed up a way of altering them with
acid. The cops never catch up with the robbers.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“How do you know all this about Shy Smile?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Blackmail,” said Leiter cheerfully. “I had a drugging rap all
lined up on one of the Spang stable boys. I let him buy his way
out of it with the details of this little caper.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What are you going to do about it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Remains to be seen. Going up to Saratoga on Sunday.”
Leiter’s face lit up. “Hell, why don’t you come along with me?
Driving up, and I’ll get you in at my dump. The Sagamore.
Swanky motel. You’ve got to sleep somewhere. Better not be
seen out together much, but we’ll be able to meet up in the evenings.
What do you say?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Wonderful,” said Bond. “Couldn’t be better. And now it’s
dam near two o’clock. Let’s have some lunch and I’ll tell you
my end of the story.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The smoked salmon was from Nova Scotia and a poor substitute
for the product of Scotland, but the Brizzola was all that
Leiter had said, so tender that Bond could cut it with a fork.
He finished his lunch with half an avocado with French dressing
and then dawdled over his Espresso.</p>

<p class="pindent">“And that’s the long and short of it.” Bond concluded the story
he had been telling between mouthfuls. “And my guess is that
the Spangs are doing the smuggling and the House of Diamonds,
which they own, is doing the merchandising. Any views?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter tapped a Lucky Strike out on to the table with his left
hand and lit it at the flame of Bond’s Ronson.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sounds possible,” he agreed after a pause. “But I don’t know
much about this brother of Seraffimo, Jack Spang. And if Jack
Spang is ‘Saye’ it’s the first I’ve heard of him for a long while.
We’ve got records on all the rest of the mob, and I’ve come across
Tiffany Case. Nice kid, but she’s been on the fringe of the gangs
for years. Didn’t have much chance from the cradle up. Her
mother ran the snazziest cat-house in San Francisco. Doing fine
until she made one hell of a mistake. Decided one day not to pay
the local outfit’s protection money. She was paying the police so
much I guess she reckoned they’d look after her. Crazy. One
night the mob turned up in force and wrecked the joint. Left the
girls alone, but had themselves a gang-bang with Tiffany. She
was only sixteen at the time. Not surprising she won’t have anything
to do with men since then. Next day she got hold of her
mother’s cash box, busted it open, and took to the hills. Then the
usual round—hat-check girl, taxi-dancer, studio extra, waitress—until
she was about twenty. Then maybe life didn’t seem so
good and she took to liquor. Settled in a rooming house down
on one of the Florida Keys and started drinking herself to death.
Got so she was known as The Boiled Sweet down there. Then a
kid fell in the sea and she jumped in and saved him. Got her
name in the papers and some rich woman took a fancy to her
and practically kidnapped her. Made her join Alcoholics Anonymous
and then took her around the world as her companion. But
Tiffany skipped when they got to ’Frisco and went and lived
with her old Ma who had retired from the girl game by then.
But she never would settle down and I guess she found life a
bit quiet so she went on the lam again and ended up in Reno.
Worked at Harold’s Club for a bit. Came across our friend Seraffimo,
and he got all excited because she wouldn’t sleep with
him. Offered her some sort of a job at the Tiara at Las Vegas
and she’s been there for the last year or two. Doing these trips
to Europe in between, I suppose. But she’s a good kid. Just never
had a chance after what the gang did to her.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond saw again the eyes gazing sullenly at him out of the
mirror, and he heard the record playing <span class="it">Feuilles Mortes</span> in the
lonely room. “I like her,” he said briefly. He felt Felix Leiter’s
eyes watching him speculatively. He looked at his watch. “Well,
Felix,” he said. “It looks as if we’ve got hold of the same tiger.
But by different tails. It’s going to be fun pulling at them both
at the same time. Now I’m going to go and get some sleep. Got
a room at the Astor. Where shall we meet on Sunday?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Better keep away from this part of town,” said Leiter. “Meet
you outside the Plaza. Early, so we can avoid the traffic on the
Parkway. Let’s say nine o’clock. By the cab-stand. You know,
where the horse-cabs are. Then if I’m late you can get to recognize
a horse. Useful up at Saratoga.”</p>

<p class="pindent">He paid the check and they walked down and out on to the
grilling street. Bond hailed a cab. Leiter refused a lift. Instead he
took Bond affectionately by the arm.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Just one thing, James,” he said, and his voice was serious.
“You may not think the hell of a lot of American gangsters.
Compared with SMERSH for instance, and some of the other
folk you’ve been up against. But I can tell you these Spangled
boys are the tops. They’ve got a good machine, even if they do
care to have funny names. And they’ve got protection. That’s
how it is in America these days. But don’t misunderstand me.
They really stink. And this job of yours stinks too.” Leiter let go
of Bond’s arm and watched him climb into the taxi. Then he
leant in through the window.</p>

<p class="pindent">“And do you know what your job stinks of, you dumb
bastard?” he asked cheerfully. “Formaldehyde and lilies.”</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_9">9<br class="lgl"/> <span class="gesp">BITTER CHAMPAGNE</span></h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>’M not going to sleep with you,” said Tiffany Case in a
matter-of-fact voice, “so don’t waste your money getting me
tight. But I’ll have another and probably another one after that.
I just don’t want to drink your Vodka Martinis under false pretences.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. He gave the order and turned back to her.
“We haven’t ordered dinner yet,” he said. “I was going to suggest
shellfish and hock. That might have changed your mind.
The combination’s supposed to have quite an effect.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Listen, Bond,” said Tiffany Case, “it’d take more than Crabmeat
Ravigotte to get me into bed with a man. In any event,
since it’s your check, I’m going to have caviar, and what you
English call ‘cutlets’, and some pink champagne. I don’t often
date a good-looking Englishman and the dinner’s going to live
up to the occasion.” Suddenly she leant towards him and reached
out a hand and put it over his. “Sorry,” she said abruptly. “I
didn’t mean that about the check. The dinner’s on me. But I did
mean it about the occasion.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled into her eyes, “Don’t be a goose, Tiffany,” he
said, using her name for the first time. “I’ve been longing for
this evening. And I’m going to have just the same as you. And
I’ve got plenty of money for the check. Mr Tree tossed me double
or quits for five hundred dollars this morning, and I won.”</p>

<p class="pindent">At the mention of Shady Tree, the girl’s manner changed.
“That ought to cover it,” she said toughly. “Just. You know
what they say about this joint? ‘All you can eat for only three
hundred bucks.’ ”</p>

<p class="pindent">The waiter brought the Martinis, shaken and not stirred, as
Bond had stipulated, and some slivers of lemon peel in a wine
glass. Bond twisted two of them and let them sink to the bottom
of his drink. He picked up his glass and looked at the girl over
the rim. “We haven’t drunk to the success of a mission,” he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl’s mouth turned down sarcastically at the corners. She
drank half the Martini at a gulp and put the glass down firmly
on the table. “Or to the heart-clutch I only just survived,” she
said dryly. “You and your dam golf. I thought you were going
to tell that man all about the chip shot you holed in oughty-ought.
A little encouragement and you’d have taken out a club
and one of those balls and shown him your swing.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You made me nervous. Clicking away at that dam lighter
trying to get your cigarette to work. I bet you put the wrong
end of that Parliament in your mouth and lit the filter.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She gave a short laugh. “You must have got eyes in your ears,”
she admitted. “Dam nearly did just that. Okay. We’ll call it
quits.” She finished her Martini. “Come on. You’re not much of
a spender. I want another of these. I’m beginning to enjoy myself.
And how about ordering dinner? Or d’you hope I’ll pass out
before you get around to it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond beckoned to the <span class="it">maître d’hôtel</span>. He gave the order, and
the wine waiter, who came from Brooklyn but wore a striped
jacket and a green apron and had a silver chain with a tasting-cup
round his neck, went off for the Clicquot Rosé.</p>

<p class="pindent">“If I have a son,” said Bond, “I’ll give him just one piece of
advice when he comes of age. I’ll say ‘Spend your money how
you like, but don’t buy yourself anything that eats’.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Hell’n Marier,” said the girl. “I must say this really is life
with a small l. Can’t you tell me something nice about my dress
or something instead of grumbling the whole time about how
expensive I am? You know what they say. ‘If you don’t like my
peaches, why do you shake my tree?’ ”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I haven’t started to shake it yet. You won’t let me get my
arms round the trunk.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She laughed and looked with approval at Bond. “Why Heavens
to Betsy, Mistah Bond,” she said. “Yo all sure do say the purtiest
things to a gal.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“And as for the frock,” Bond continued, “it’s a dream, and
you know it is. I love black velvet, especially against a sunburnt
skin, and I’m glad you don’t wear too much jewellery, and I’m
glad you don’t paint your fingernails. Altogether, I bet you’re
the prettiest smuggler in New York tonight. Who are you
smuggling with tomorrow?”</p>

<p class="pindent">She picked up her third Martini and looked at it. Then very
slowly, in three swallows, she drank it down. She put down the
glass and took a Parliament out of the box beside her plate and
bent towards the flame of Bond’s lighter. The valley between her
breasts opened for him. She looked up at him through the smoke
of her cigarette, and suddenly her eyes widened and then slowly
narrowed again. “I like you,” they said. “All is possible between
us. But don’t be impatient. And be kind. I don’t want to be hurt
any more.”</p>

<p class="pindent">And then the waiter came with the caviar, and suddenly the
noise of the restaurant burst into the warm, silent room-within-a-room
which they had built for themselves, and the spell was
broken.</p>

<p class="pindent">“What am I doing tomorrow?” repeated Tiffany Case in the
voice one puts on in front of waiters. “Why, I’m going to sashay
off to Las Vegas. Taking the 20th Century to Chicago and then
the Superchief to Los Angeles. It’s a long way round, but I’ve
had enough flying for a few days. What about you?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The waiter had gone. For a while they ate their caviar in
silence. There was no need to answer the question immediately.
Bond suddenly felt they had all the time in the world. They both
knew the answer to the big question. For the answers to small
ones there was no hurry.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat back. The wine waiter brought the champagne and
Bond tasted it. It was ice cold and seemed to have a faint taste of
strawberries. It was delicious.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m going up to Saratoga,” he said. “I’m to back a horse
that’s to make me some money.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I suppose it’s a fix,” said Tiffany Case sourly. She drank
some of the champagne. Her mood had changed again. She
shrugged her shoulders. “You seem to have made quite a hit
with Shady this morning,” she said indifferently. “He wants to
put you to work for the mob.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked down into the pink pool of champagne. He could
feel the fog of treachery creeping up between him and this girl
he liked. He closed his mind to it. He must get on with tricking
her.</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s fine,” he said easily. “I’d like that. But who is ‘The
Mob’?” He busied himself with lighting a cigarette, conjuring up
the professional to keep the human quiet.</p>

<p class="pindent">He could feel her looking sharply at him. It put him on his
mettle. The secret agent took over and his mind began to work
coldly, watching for clues, for lies, for hesitations.</p>

<p class="pindent">He looked up and his eyes were candid.</p>

<p class="pindent">She seemed satisfied. “It’s called the Spangled Mob. Two
brothers called Spang. I work for one of them in Las Vegas.
Nobody seems to know where the other one is. Some say he’s
in Europe. And then there’s somebody called ABC. When I’m
on this diamond racket, all the orders come from him. The
other one, Seraffimo, he’s the brother I work for. He’s more
interested in gambling and horses. Runs a wire service and the
Tiara at Vegas.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What do you do there?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I just work there,” she said, closing the subject.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Do you like it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">She ignored the question as being too stupid to answer.</p>

<p class="pindent">“And then there’s Shady,” she went on. “He’s not a bad guy
really, except he’s so crooked, you shake hands with him you
better count your fingers afterwards. He looks after the cat-houses
and the dope and the rest of the stuff. There are plenty
of other fellers—hoodlums of one sort and another. Tough
operators.” She looked at him and her eyes hardened. “You’ll
get to know them,” she sneered. “You’ll like them. Just your
type.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Hell,” said Bond indignantly. “It’s just another job. I’ve got
to earn some money.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“There are plenty of other ways.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, these are the people you’ve chosen to work for.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You’ve got something there.” She laughed wryly, and the
ice was broken again. “But, believe me, you’re getting into the
big league when you sign up with the Spangles. If I were you,
I’d think the hell of a long time before you join our cosy little
circle. And don’t go and get in wrong with the mob. If you’re
planning anything of that sort, you’d better start taking lessons
with a harp.”</p>

<p class="pindent">They were interrupted by the arrival of the cutlets, accompanied
by asparagus with mousseline sauce, and by one of the
famous Kriendler brothers who have owned ‘21’ ever since it
was the best speak-easy in New York.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Hullo, Miss Tiffany,” he said. “Long time no see. How are
things out at Vegas?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Hello, Mac.” The girl smiled up at him. “Tiara’s going
along okay.” She glanced round the packed room. “Seems your
little hot dog stand ain’t doing too badly.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Can’t complain,” said the tall young man. “Too much expense-account
aristocracy. Never enough pretty girls around.
You ought to come in more often.” He smiled at Bond. “Everything
all right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Couldn’t be better.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Come again.” He snapped a finger at the wine waiter. “Sam,
ask my friends what they’d like to have with their coffee.” And,
with a final smile which embraced them both, he moved to
another table.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiffany ordered a Stinger made with white <span class="it">crème de menthe</span>
and Bond ordered the same.</p>

<p class="pindent">When the liqueurs and the coffee came, Bond took up the
conversation where they had left it. “But Tiffany,” he said. “This
diamond racket looks easy enough. Why shouldn’t we just go
on doing it together? Two or three trips a year will get us good
money, and that won’t be often enough to make Immigration
or customs ask any awkward questions.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiffany Case was not impressed. “Just you put it up to ABC,”
she said. “I keep telling you that these people aren’t fools.
They’re running a big operation with this stuff. I’ve never had
the same carrier twice, and I’m not the only guard doing the
run. What’s more, I’m pretty certain we weren’t alone on that
plane. I bet they had someone else watching us both. They check
and double check on every dam thing they do.” She was irritated
with his lack of respect for the quality of her employers. “Why,
I’ve never even seen ABC,” she said. “I just call up a number in
London and get my orders on a wire-recorder. Anything I’ve got
to say, I send back to ABC the same way. I tell you all this is
way above your head. You and your dam country house burglaries.”
She was crushing. “Brother! Have you got another
think coming!”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I see,” said Bond respectfully, wondering how the hell he
could get the ABC telephone number out of her. “They certainly
seem to think of everything.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Bet your life,” said the girl flatly. The subject was now boring.
She gazed moodily into her Stinger, and then drank it down.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sensed the beginning of a <span class="it">vin triste</span>. “Care to go somewhere
else?” he said, knowing that it had been he who had
killed the evening.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Hell no,” she said dully. “Take me home. I’m getting tight.
Why’n hell couldn’t you dream up something else to talk about
except these goddam hoodlums?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond paid the check and in silence they went down and out
of the cool envelope of the restaurant into the sultry night that
stank of petrol and hot asphalt.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Staying at the Astor too,” she said as they got into a cab. She
pressed into the far corner of the back seat and sat hunched up
with her chin in her hand, looking out at the hideous deadly
nightshade of the neon.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said nothing. He looked out of the window and cursed
his job. All he wanted to say to this girl was: “Listen. Come
with me. I like you. Don’t be afraid. It can’t be worse than
alone.” But if she said yes he would have been smart. And he
didn’t want to be smart with this girl. It was his job to use her,
but, whatever the job dictated, there was one way he would never
‘use’ this particular girl. Through the heart.</p>

<p class="pindent">In front of the Astor, he helped her out on to the sidewalk
and she stood with her back to him while he paid the driver.
They walked up the steps in the stiff silence of a married couple
after a bad evening ending in a row.</p>

<p class="pindent">They got their keys at the desk and she said “five” to the boy
on the elevator. She stood with her face to the door as they rode
up. Bond saw that the knuckles of the hand that held her evening
bag were white. At the fifth she walked quickly out and
made no protest when Bond followed her. They walked round
several corners until they came to her door. She bent down and
fitted the key into the lock and pushed the door open. Then she
turned in the entrance and faced him.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Listen, you Bond person . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">It had started as the beginning of an angry speech, but then
she paused and looked straight into his eyes, and Bond saw that
her eyelashes were wet. And suddenly she had flung an arm
round his neck and her face was against his and she was saying
“Look after yourself, James. I don’t want to lose you.” And then
she pulled his face against hers and kissed him once, hard and
long on the lips, with a fierce tenderness that was almost without
sex.</p>

<p class="pindent">But, as Bond’s arms went round her and he started to return
her kiss, she suddenly stiffened and fought her way free, and
the moment was over.</p>

<p class="pindent">With her hand on the knob of the open door, she turned and
looked at him, and the sultry glow was back in her eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Now get away from me,” she said fiercely, and slammed the
door and locked it.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_10">10<br class="lgl"/> <span class="gesp">STUDILLAC TO SARATOGA</span></h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">J</span>AMES BOND spent most of Saturday in his air-conditioned
room at the Astor, avoiding the heat, sleeping, and composing
a hundred-group cable addressed to the Chairman, Universal
Export, London. He used a simple transposition code based
on the fact that it was the sixth day of the week and that the
date was the fourth of the eighth month.</p>

<p class="pindent">The report concluded that the diamond pipeline began somewhere
near Jack Spang, in the shape of Rufus B. Saye, and ended
with Seraffimo Spang, and that the main junction in the pipe
was the office of Shady Tree from which, presumably, the stones
were fed into the House of Diamonds for cutting and marketing.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond requested London to put a close tail on Rufus B. Saye,
but he warned that an individual known as ‘ABC’ seemed to
be in direct command of the actual smuggling on behalf of the
Spangled Mob, and that Bond had no clue to this individual’s
identity except that he appeared to be located in London. Presumably
only this man would provide a lead back to the actual
source of the smuggled diamonds somewhere on the continent
of Africa.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond reported that his own intention was to continue working
up the pipeline in the direction of Seraffimo Spang, using as
an unconscious agent Tiffany Case, whose background he briefly
reported.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sent the cable ‘Collect’ via Western Union, had his
fourth shower of the day and went to Voisin’s where he had two
Vodka Martinis, <span class="it">Oeufs Benedict</span> and strawberries. Over dinner
he read the racing forecasts for the Saratoga meeting, from which
he noted that the joint favourites for The Perpetuities Stakes
were Mr C. V. Whitney’s Come Again and Mr William Woodward
Jnr’s Pray Action. Shy Smile was not mentioned.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then Bond walked back to his hotel and went to bed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Punctually at nine on Sunday morning, a black Studebaker
convertible drew up to the sidewalk where Bond was standing
beside his suitcase.</p>

<p class="pindent">When he had thrown his case on to the back seat and climbed
in beside Leiter, Leiter reached up to the roof and pulled back a
lever. Then he pressed a button on the dash, and, with a thin
hydraulic whine, the canvas roof slowly raised itself up into the
air and folded itself down and back into a recess between the rear
seat and the boot. Then, manipulating the steering wheel gearshift
with easy movements of his steel hook, he took the car fast
across Central Park.</p>

<p class="pindent">“It’s about two hundred miles,” said Leiter when they were
down on the Hudson River Parkway. “Almost due north up the
Hudson. In New York State. Just south of the Adirondacks and
not far short of the Canadian border. We’ll take the Taconic
Parkway. There’s no hurry, so we’ll go easy. And I don’t want
to get a ticket. There’s a fifty-mile speed limit in most of New
York State, and the cops are fierce. But I can generally get away
from them if I’m in a hurry. They don’t book you if they can’t
catch you. Too ashamed to turn up in court and admit something
is faster than their Indians.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“But I thought those Indians could do well over ninety,” said
Bond, thinking that his friend had become a bit of a show-off
since the old days. “I didn’t know these Studebakers had it in
them.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a straight stretch of empty road in front of them.
Leiter gave a brief glance in his driving mirror and suddenly
rammed the gear lever into second and thrust his foot into the
floor. Bond’s head jerked back on his shoulders, and he felt his
spine being rammed into the back of the bucket seat. Incredulously,
he glanced at the hooded speedometer. Eighty. With a
clang Leiter’s hook hit the gear lever into top. The car went on
gathering speed. Ninety, ninety-five, six, seven—and then there
was a bridge and a converging road and Leiter’s foot was on the
brake and the deep roar of the engine gave way to a steady
thrumming as they settled down in the seventies and swept easily
through the graded curves.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter glanced sideways at Bond and grinned. “Nearly another
thirty in hand,” he said proudly. “Not long ago I paid five dollars
and put her through the measured mile at Daytona. She clocked
a hundred and twenty-seven and that beach surface isn’t any too
hot.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well I’ll be damned,” said Bond incredulously. “But what
sort of a car is this anyway? Isn’t it a Studebaker?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Studillac,” said Leiter. “Studebaker with a Cadillac engine.
Special transmission and brakes and rear axle. Conversion job.
A small firm near New York turns them out. Only a few, but
they’re a damn sight better sports car than those Corvettes and
Thunderbirds. And you couldn’t have anything better than this
body. Designed by that Frenchman, Raymond Loewy. Best designer
in the world. But it’s a bit too advanced for the American
market. Studebaker’s never got enough credit for this body. Too
unconventional. Like the car? Bet I could give your old Bentley
a licking.” Leiter chuckled and reached in his left-hand pocket
for a dime as they came to the Henry Hudson Bridge toll.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Until one of your wheels came off,” said Bond caustically as
they accelerated away again. “This sort of hot-rod job’s all right
for kids who can’t afford a real motor car.”</p>

<p class="pindent">They wrangled cheerfully over the respective merits of English
and American sports cars until they came to the Westchester
County toll and then, fifteen minutes later, they were out on the
Taconic Parkway that snaked away northwards through a hundred
miles of meadows and woodlands, and Bond settled back
and silently enjoyed one of the most beautifully landscaped highways
in the world, and wondered idly what the girl was doing
and how, after Saratoga, he was to get to her again.</p>

<p class="pindent">At 12.30 they stopped for lunch at The Chicken in the Basket,
a log-built Frontier-style road-house with standard equipment—a
tall counter covered with the best-known proprietary brands of
chocolates and candies, cigarettes, cigars, magazines and paperbacks,
a juke box blazing with chromium and coloured lights
that looked like something out of science fiction, a dozen or
more polished pine tables in the centre of the raftered room and
as many low booths along the walls, a menu featuring fried
chicken and ‘fresh mountain trout’, which had spent months in
some distant deep-freeze, and a variety of short-order dishes, and
a couple of waitresses who couldn’t care less.</p>

<p class="pindent">But the scrambled eggs and sausages and hot buttered rye toast
and the Miller High Life beer came quickly and were good, and
so was the iced coffee that followed it, and with their second
glass they got away from ‘shop’ and their private lives and got on
to Saratoga.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Eleven months of the year,” explained Leiter, “the place is
just dead. People drift up to take the waters and the mud baths
for their troubles, rheumatism and such like, and it’s like any
other off-season spa anywhere in the world. Everybody’s in bed
by nine, and the only signs of life in the daytime are when two
old gentlemen in panama hats get to arguing about the surrender
of Burgoyne at Schuylerville just down the road, or about
whether the marble floor of the old Union Hotel was black or
white. And then for one month—August—the place goes hog-wild.
It’s probably the smartest race-meeting in America, and the
place crawls with Vanderbilts and Whitneys. The rooming
houses all multiply their prices by ten and the race-track committee
lick the old grandstand up with paint and somehow find
some swans for the pond in the centre of the track and anchor
the old Indian canoe in the middle of the pond and turn up the
fountain. Nobody can remember where the canoe came from,
and an American racing writer who tried to find out got as far
as that it was something to do with an Indian legend. He said
that when he heard that he didn’t bother any more. He said that
when he was in fourth grade, he could tell a better lie than any
Indian legend he ever heard.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. “What else?” he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You ought to know about it yourself,” said Leiter. “Used to
be a great place for the English—the belted ones, that is. The
Jersey Lily used to be around there a lot, your Lily Langtry.
About the time Novelty beat Iron Mask in the Hopeful Stakes.
But it’s changed a bit since the Mauve Decade. Here,” he pulled
a cutting out of his pocket. “This’ll bring you up to date. Cut it
out of the <span class="it">Post</span> this morning. This Jimmy Cannon is their sports
columnist. Good writer. Knows what he’s talking about. Read it
in the car. We ought to be moving.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter left some money on the check and they went out and,
while the Studillac throbbed along the winding road towards
Troy, Bond settled himself down with Jimmy Cannon’s tough
prose. As he read, the Saratoga of the Jersey Lily’s day vanished
into the dusty, sweet past and the twentieth century looked out at
him from the piece of newsprint and bared its teeth in a sneer.</p>

<div class="blockquoter">

<p class="pindent1">The village of Saratoga Springs [he read beneath the photograph
of an attractive young man with wide, straight eyes and a
rather thin-lipped smile] was the Coney Island of the underworld
until the Kefauvers put their show on the television. It frightened
the hicks and chased the hoodlums to Las Vegas. But the mobs
exercised dominion over Saratoga for a long time. It was a colony
of the national gangs and they ran it with pistols and baseball bats.</p>

<p class="pindent1">Saratoga seceded from the union, as did the other gambling
hamlets that placed their municipal governments in the custody of
the racket corporations. It is still a place where the decent inheritors
of old fortunes and famous names come to run their stables
under racing conditions that are primitive and suggest a country
fair meeting for quarter horses.</p>

<p class="pindent1">Before Saratoga closed down hitch-hikers were thrown into the
can by a constabulary that banked its pay checks and lived off the
tips of murderers and panderers. Impoverishment was a serious
violation of the law in Saratoga. Drunks, who got loaded at the
bars of dice joints, were also considered menaces when they tapped
out.</p>

<p class="pindent1">But the killer was extended the liberty of the place as long as
he paid off and held an interest in a local institution. It could be
a house of prostitution or a backroom crap game where the busted
could shoot two bits.</p>

<p class="pindent1">Professional curiosity compels me to read the literature of the
scratch sheets. The racing journalists call back the tranquil years
as though Saratoga was always a town of frivolous innocence.
What a rotten burg it used to be.</p>

<p class="pindent1">It is possible that there are bust-out gaffs sneaking in farm-houses
on back roads. Such action is insignificant and the player
must be prepared to be knocked out as rapidly as the dealer can
switch the dice. But the gambling casinos of Saratoga were never
square and anyone who caught a hot hand was measured for a
trimming.</p>

<p class="pindent1">The road houses ran through the night on the shores of the lake.
The big entertainers shilled for the games which were not financed
to be beaten. The stick men and the wheel turners were the
nomadic hustlers who were paid by the day and travelled the
gambling circuit from Newport, Ky., down to Miami in the winter
and back up to Saratoga for August. Most of them were educated
in Steubenville, O., where the penny-ante games were trade schools
for the industry.</p>

<p class="pindent1">They were drifters and most of them had no talent for mussing
up a welsher. They were clerks of the underworld and they packed
up and left as soon as any heat was turned their way. Most of them
have settled down in Las Vegas and Reno where their old bosses
have taken charge with licences hanging on the walls.</p>

<p class="pindent1">Their employers were not gamblers in the tradition of old Col.
E. R. Bradley who was a stately man of courteous deportment. But
there are those who tell me that his gambling bazaar at Palm
Beach would go along with a mark until his score piled up too high.</p>

<p class="pindent1">Then, according to those who have gone against Bradley’s games,
mechanics took over and used any device that would keep the house
solvent. It delights those who recollect Bradley when they read his
canonization as a philanthropist whose hobby was giving the rich
a little divertisement denied them by the state of Florida. But, compared
to the lice who controlled Saratoga, Col. Bradley is entitled
to all the praise he gets in the remembrances of the sentimentalists.</p>

<p class="pindent1">The track at Saratoga is a ramshackle pile of kindling wood
and the climate is hot and humid. There are some, such as Al
Vanderbilt and Jock Whitney, who are sportsmen in the obsolete
sense of the identification. Horse-racing is their game and they
are too good for it. So are such trainers as Bill Winfrey, who sent
Native Dancer to the races. There are jockeys who would bust you
in the nose if you propositioned them to pull a horse.</p>

<p class="pindent1">They enjoy Saratoga and they must be glad that the likes of
Lucky Luciano are gone from the rube town that flourished because
it allowed tough guys to fleece the drop-ins. The bookmakers
were yegged as they left the track in the era of the hand-books.
There was one called Kid Tatters who was relieved of $50,000
in the parking lot. The heist guys told him they intended to kidnap
him if he didn’t come up with more.</p>

<p class="pindent1">Kid Tatters knew Lucky had a piece of most of the gambling
spots and appealed to him to settle his trouble. Lucky said it was
a simple matter. No one would bother the bookie if he did as he
was told. Kid Tatters had a permit to book at the track and his
reputation was clean, but there was only one way he could protect
himself.</p>

<p class="pindent1">“Make me your partner,” Lucky informed him and the conversation
was repeated for me by a man who was present. “No
one would stick up a partner of Lucky’s.”</p>

<p class="pindent1">Kid Tatters thought of himself as an honourable guy in business
sanctioned by the state, but he gave in and Lucky was his
partner until he died. I asked a guy if Lucky put up any money
or worked for his end of the bookmaker’s profit.</p>

<p class="pindent1">“All Lucky did was collect,” the fellow said “But in those days,
Kid Tatters made himself a good bargain. He was never bothered
again.”</p>

<p class="pindent1">It was a stinking town, but all gambling towns are.</p>

</div>

<p class="pindent">Bond folded the cutting and put it in his pocket.</p>

<p class="pindent">“It certainly sounds a long way from Lily Langtry,” he said
after a pause.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sure,” said Leiter indifferently. “And Jimmy Cannon doesn’t
let on he knows the big boys are back again, or their successors.
But nowadays they’re owners, like our friends the Spangs, running
their horses against the Whitneys and the Vanderbilts and
the Woodwards, and now and again putting over a fast fix like
Shy Smile. They aim to net fifty Grand on that job, and that’s
better than knocking off a bookie for a few C’s. Sure, some of
the names have changed around Saratoga. So’s the mud in the
mud baths there.”</p>

<p class="pindent">A big road sign loomed up on the right. It said:</p>

<div class="lgc"> <!-- rend=';fs:.8em;' -->
<p class="line4">STOP AT THE SAGAMORE.</p>
<p class="line4">AIR-CONDITIONED. SLUMBERITE BEDS. TELEVISION.</p>
<p class="line4">FIVE MILES TO SARATOGA SPRINGS,</p>
<p class="line8">AND THE SAGAMORE—FOR GRACIOUS LIVING</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class="pindent">“That means we get our tooth glasses wrapped in individual
paper bags and the lavatory seat sealed with a strip of sanitized
paper,” commented Leiter sourly. “And don’t think you can
steal those Slumberite beds. Motels used to lose one most weeks.
Now they screw them down.”</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_11">11<br class="lgl"/> <span class="gesp">SHY SMILE</span></h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE first thing that struck Bond about Saratoga was the
green majesty of the elms, which gave the discreet avenues
of Colonial-type clapboard houses some of the peace and serenity
of a European watering place. And there were horses everywhere,
being walked across the streets, with a policeman holding
up the traffic, being coaxed out of horse-boxes around the
sprawling groups of stables, cantering along the cinder borders
of the roads, and being led to work on the exercise track alongside
the race-course near the centre of the town. Stableboys and
jockeys, white, negro and Mexican, hung about at the street
corners and there was the whinny and the occasional trumpeting
scream of horses in the air.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a mixture of Newmarket and Vichy, and it suddenly
occurred to Bond that although he wasn’t in the least interested
in horses, he rather liked the life that went with them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter dropped him at the Sagamore, which was on the edge
of the town and only half a mile from the race-track, and went
off about his business. They agreed to contact each other only at
night or casually in the crowds at the races, but to pay a dawn
visit to the exercise track if Shy Smile was being given a last
workout at sunrise the next day. Leiter said he would know
about this, and much more, after an evening around the stables
and at The Tether, the all-night restaurant and bar that was the
home of the racing underworld when they came up for the
August meeting.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond checked himself in at the central office of the Sagamore,
signed ‘James Bond, Hotel Astor, New York’, before a hatchet-faced
woman whose steel-rimmed eyes assumed that Bond, like
most of her other seekers after ‘gracious living’, intended to
steal the towels and possibly the sheets, paid thirty dollars for
three days and was given a key to Room 49.</p>

<p class="pindent">He carried his bag across the parched lawn, between the beds
of Beauty Bush and forced gladioli, and let himself into the neat
spare double room with the armchair, the bedside table, the
Currier and Ives print, the chest of drawers and the brown
plastic ash-tray that are standard motel equipment all over
America. The lavatory and shower were immaculate and neatly
designed and, as Leiter had prophesied, the tooth glasses were
contained in paper bags ‘for your protection’ and the lavatory
seat was barred by a strip of paper which said ‘sanitized’.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took a shower and changed and walked down the road
and had two Bourbon old-fashioneds and the Chicken Dinner at
$2.80 in the air-conditioned eating house on the corner that was
as typical of ‘the American way of life’ as the motel. Then he
returned to his room and lay on his bed with the <span class="it">Saratogian</span>,
from which he learned that a certain T. Bell would be riding
Shy Smile in The Perpetuities.</p>

<p class="pindent">Soon after ten, Felix Leiter knocked softly on the door and
limped in. He smelled of liquor and cheap cigar smoke and
looked pleased with himself.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Made some progress,” he said. He hooked the armchair up
to the foot of the bed on which Bond was lying. He sat down
and took out a cigarette. “Means getting up damned early in
the morning. Five o’clock. The word is they’ll be timing Shy
Smile over four furlongs at 5.30. I’d like to see who’s around
when they’re doing that. The owner’s given as Pissaro. One of
the directors of the Tiara happens to be called that. He’s another
one with a joke name. ‘Lame-brain’ Pissaro. Used to be in charge
of their dope racket. Ran the stuff over the Mexican border and
then broke it down and parcelled it out to middlemen on the
coast. The FBI got on to him and he did a term in San Quentin.
Then he came out and Spang gave him the job at the Tiara in
exchange for the rap he’d carried. And now he’s a racehorse
owner like the Vanderbilts. Nice going. I’ll be interested to see
what sort of shape he’s in these days. He was almost a mainliner
in the days he was dealing in coke. They gave him the
cure in San Q, but it’s left him a bit soft in the head. Hence the
‘Lame-brain’. Then there’s the jock, ‘Tingaling’ Bell. Good rider
but not above this sort of caper if the money’s right and he’s in
the clear. I want to have a word with Tingaling if I can get him
alone. I’ve got a little proposition for him. The trainer’s another
hoodlum—name of Budd, ‘Rosy’ Budd. They all sound pretty
funny, these names. But you don’t want to be taken in by it.
He’s from Kentucky, so he knows all about horses. He’s been
in trouble all over the South, what they call a ‘little habitch’ as
opposed to a ‘big habitch’—habitual criminal. Larceny, mugging,
rape—nothing big. Enough to give him quite a bulky
packet in police records. But for the last few years he’s been
running straight, if you care to call it that, as trainer for Spang.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter flicked his cigarette accurately through the open window
into a bed of gladioli. He got up and stretched. “Those
are the actors in the order of their appearance,” he said. “Distinguished
cast. Look forward to lighting a fire under them.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was mystified. “But why don’t you just turn them over
to the Stewards? Who are your principals in all this? Who pays
the bills?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Retained by the leading owners,” said Leiter. “They pay us
a retainer and extra by results. And I wouldn’t get far with the
Stewards. Wouldn’t be fair to put the stable-boy in the box. Be
the death sentence for him. The veterinary has passed the horse,
and the real Shy Smile was shot and burned months ago. No.
I’ve got my own ideas, and they’re going to hurt the Spangled
boys far more than a disbarment from the tracks. You’ll see.
Anyway, five o’clock, and I’ll come and hammer on the door
just in case.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’t worry,” said Bond. “I’ll be on the doorstep with my
boots and my saddle while the coyotes are still baying the
moon.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond woke on time and there was a wonderful freshness in
the air as he followed the limping figure of Leiter through the
half light that filtered through the elms among the waking
stables. In the east, the sky was pearly grey and iridescent, like a
toy balloon filled with cigarette smoke, and among the shrubs
the mocking birds were beginning their first song. Blue smoke
rose straight up in the air from the fires in the camps behind
the stables and there was a smell of coffee and wood-smoke and
dew. There was the clank of pails and the other small noises of
men and horses in the early morning and as they moved out
from under the trees to the white wooden rail that bordered the
track, a file of blanketed horses came by with a boy at each
head, holding the leading rein right up close to the bit and
talking with soft roughness to their charges. “Hey, lazybones,
pick yo feet up. Giddap. You sho ain’t no Man-O-War dis
mornin’.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“They’ll be getting ready for the morning works,” said Leiter.
“The gallops. This is the time the trainers hate most. When the
owners come.”</p>

<p class="pindent">They leant against the rail, thinking about the early morning,
and about breakfast, and the sun suddenly caught the trees half
a mile away on the other side of the track and brushed the topmost
branches with pale gold, and in minutes the last shadows
had gone and it was day.</p>

<p class="pindent">As if they had been waiting for the sign, three men appeared
from among the trees away to the left, and one of them was
leading a big chestnut with a blaze face and four white stockings.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’t look at them,” said Leiter softly. “Turn your back
on the track and watch that file of horses coming up. That old
bent man with them is ‘Sunny Jim’ Fitzsimmons, greatest trainer
in America. And those are the Woodward horses. Most of them
will be winners this meeting. Just look casual and I’ll keep an
eye on our friends. Wouldn’t do to seem too interested. Now let’s
see, there’s a stable-boy leading Shy Smile and that’s Budd all
right and my old friend Lame-brain in a beautiful lavender
shirt. Always a dresser. Nice-looking horse. Powerful shoulders.
They’ve taken the blanket off him and he doesn’t like the cold.
Bucking around like mad with the stable-boy hanging on. Sure
hope he doesn’t kick Mr Pissaro in the face. Now Budd’s got
him and he’s quietened down. Budd’s given the boy a leg up.
Leading him on to the track. Now he’s cantering slowly up the
far side of the track to one of the furlong posts. The hoodlums
have got their watches out, they’re looking round. They’ve
spotted us. Just look casual, James. Once the horse gets going
they won’t be interested in us. Yeah. You can turn round now.
Shy Smile’s on the far side of the track and they’ve got their
glasses on her to be ready for the off. And it will be four furlongs.
Pissaro’s just by the fifth post.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned and looked along the rail to his left at the two
stocky intent figures with the sun glinting on their glasses and
on the watches in their hands and, although he didn’t believe
in these people, the dusk seemed to seep out around them from
under the golden elms.</p>

<p class="pindent">“He’s off.” Far away Bond could see a flying brown horse
rounding the top end of the track and turning into the long
stretch towards them. At that distance, not a sound came to
them, but quickly there was a soft drumming on the tan track
that grew until, with a swift thunder of hooves, the horse
rounded the bend in front of them, right up against the far rails,
and hurtled on the last furlong towards the watching men.</p>

<p class="pindent">A tingle of excitement ran down Bond’s spine as the chestnut
flashed by, its teeth bared and its eyes wild with the effort, its
gleaming quarters pounding and the breath snorting out of its
wide nostrils, the boy on its back arched like a cat in the stirrups,
his face low down and almost touching the horse’s neck. And
then they had gone in a spray of sound and upflung earth and
Bond’s eyes moved to the two watching men, now crouching,
and he saw the two arms jerk downwards as they jammed down
the stops on their watches.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter touched him on the arm and they moved casually away
and back under the trees towards the car.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Moving dam’ well,” commented Leiter. “Better than the
real Shy Smile ever did. No idea what the time was, but he was
certainly burning up the track. If he can do that for a mile and
a quarter he’ll get home. And he’ll have an allowance of six
pounds seeing as how he hasn’t won a race this year. And that’ll
give him an extra edge. Now let’s go and have the hell of a
breakfast. It’s given me an appetite seeing these crooks so early
in the morning.” And then he added softly, almost to himself,
“And then I’m going to see how much Master Bell will take to
ride foul and get himself disqualified.”</p>

<p class="pindent">After breakfast, and after hearing some more of Leiter’s
plans, Bond idled away the morning and then had lunch at the
track and watched the indifferent racing that Leiter had warned
him he would see on the first afternoon of the meeting.</p>

<p class="pindent">But it was a beautiful day and Bond enjoyed absorbing the
Saratoga idiom, the mixture of Brooklyn and Kentucky in the
milling crowds, the elegance of the owners and their friends in
the tree-shaded paddock, the efficient mechanics of the <span class="it">parimutuel</span>
and the big board with its flashing lights recording the
odds and the money invested, the trouble-free starts through the
tractor-drawn starting-gate, the toy lake with its six swans and
the anchored canoe and, everywhere, that extra exotic touch of
the Negroes who, except as jockeys, are so much a part of
American racing.</p>

<p class="pindent">The organization looked better than in England. There
seemed less chance of crookedness where so much crookedness
had been insured against, but, back of it all, Bond knew that
the illegal wire services were relaying the results of each race
throughout the States, cutting the tote odds to a maximum of
20-8-4, twentys for a win, eights for first or second, and fours
for a place, and that millions of dollars every year were going
straight into the pockets of gangsters to whom racing was just
another source of revenue like prostitution or drugs.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond tried out the system made famous by ‘Chicago’ O’Brien.
He backed every firm favourite for a place, or ‘to show’ as his
first ticket-hatch told him to call it, and he had somehow made
fifteen dollars and some cents by the end of the eighth race
and the day’s meeting. He walked home with the crowds, had
a shower and some sleep and then found his way to a restaurant
near the sales ring and spent an hour drinking the drink that
Leiter had told him was fashionable in racing circles—Bourbon
and branch-water. Bond guessed that in fact the water was from
the tap behind the bar, but Leiter had said that real Bourbon
drinkers insist on having their whisky in the traditional style,
with water from high up in the branch of the local river where
it will be purest. The barman didn’t seem surprised when he
asked for it, and Bond was amused at the conceit. Then he ate
an adequate steak and, after a final Bourbon, walked over to the
sales ring, which Leiter had fixed as a rendezvous.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a white-painted wooden enclosure, roofed but without
walls, in which tiered benches descended to a circle of mock
greensward enclosed with silver-painted ropes in front of the
auctioneer’s platform. As each horse was led in under the glare
of the neon lighting, the auctioneer, the redoubtable Swinebroad
from Tennessee, would give the history of the horse and start
the bidding at what he thought a likely figure, and run it up
through the hundreds in a kind of rhythmic chant, catching,
with the help of two dinner-jacketed men in the aisles, every
nod or raised pencil among the tiers of smartly dressed owners
and agents.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat down behind a scrawny woman in evening dress
and mink whose wrists clanked and glittered with jewellery
every time she bid. Beside her sat a bored man in a white dinner
jacket and a dark red evening tie who might have been her
husband or her trainer.</p>

<p class="pindent">A nervous bay came chasseing into the ring with the number
201 pasted carelessly on his rump. The harsh chant began. “I’m
bid six thousand now seven thousand will yer? I’m bid seven
thousand and three and four and five only seven and a half for
this good-looking colt by Tehran, eight thousand thank you sir
and nine will yer do it? Eight thousand five hundred I am bid
will yer give me nine eight five will yer give me nine and six
and seven and who’ll bid the big figure?”</p>

<p class="pindent">A pause, a bang of the hammer, a look of sincere reproach
towards the ringside seats where the big money sat. “Folks,
this two-year-old is too cheap. I’m selling more winning colt
for this amount of money than I’ve sold all summer long. Now,
eight thousand seven hundred and who’ll give me nine?
Where’s nine, nine, nine?” (The mummified hand in the rings
and bracelets took the gold-and-bamboo pencil out of the bag
and scribbled a calculation on the programme which Bond
could see said ‘34th Annual Saratoga Yearling Sales. No 201.
A Bay Colt.’ Then the leaden eyes of the woman looked across
the silver ropes into the electric eyes of the horse and she raised
the gold pencil) “And nine thousand is bid nine will yer give
me ten will yer do it? Any increase on nine thousand do I hear
nine one nine one nine one?” (A pause and a last questing look
round the crammed white seats and then a bang of the hammer.)
“Sold for nine thousand dollars. Thank you, ma’am.”</p>

<p class="pindent">And the heads turned round and craned and the woman
looked bored and said something to the man beside her who
shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class="pindent">And 201, ‘A Bay Colt’, was led from the ring and 202 came
sidling in to stand for a moment trembling with the shock of
the lights, and the wall of unknown faces, and the fog of strange
smells.</p>

<p class="pindent">And there was a movement in the row of seats behind Bond,
and Leiter’s face came forward alongside his and Leiter’s mouth
said into his ear, “It’s done. It’s cost three thousand bucks but
he’ll play the double-cross. Foul riding in the last furlong just
as he’s due to make his winning sprint. Oh Boy! See you in
the morning.” And the whisper ended, and Bond didn’t look
round but went on watching the sales for a while and then
slowly walked home under the elms, feeling sorry for a jockey
called Tingaling Bell who was playing such a desperately dangerous
game, and for a big chestnut called Shy Smile who was
now not only a ringer but was going to be ridden foul into the
bargain.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_12">12<br class="lgl"/> <span class="gesp">THE PERPETUITIES</span></h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">B</span>OND sat high up in the grandstand and through hired glasses
watched Shy Smile’s owner eating soft-shell crabs.</p>

<p class="pindent">The gangster was sitting in the restaurant enclosure four rows
below Bond. Opposite him sat Rosy Budd forking down frankfurters
and sauerkraut and drinking beer out of a stein.
Although most of the other luncheon tables were occupied,
there were two waiters hovering round this one and the maître
d’hôtel made frequent visits to see that all was going well.</p>

<p class="pindent">Pissaro looked like a gangster in a horror comic. He had a
round bladder-like head in the middle of which the features
were crowded together—two pinpoint eyes, two black nostrils,
a pursed wet pink mouth above the hint of a chin, and a fat
body in a brown suit and a white shirt with a long-pointed
collar and a figured chocolate bow tie. He paid no attention to
the preparations for the first race but concentrated on his food,
occasionally glancing across at his companion’s plate as if he
might reach across and fork something off it for himself.</p>

<p class="pindent">Rosy Budd was broad and hard-looking, with a square immobile
poker player’s face in which pale eyes were buried deep
under thin fair eyebrows. He was wearing a striped seersucker
suit and a dark blue tie. He ate slowly and rarely looked up
from his plate. When he had finished, he picked up a race programme
and studied it, turning over the pages carefully. Without
looking up, he gave a curt shake of the head when the
maître d’hôtel offered him the menu.</p>

<p class="pindent">Pissaro picked his teeth until a mound of ice-cream arrived,
and then he bent his head again and started spooning the ice
cream rapidly up into his small mouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">Through his glasses, Bond examined the two men and wondered
about them. What did these people amount to? Bond
remembered cold, dedicated, chess-playing Russians; brilliant,
neurotic Germans; silent, deadly, anonymous men from Central
Europe; the people in his own Service—the double-firsts,
the gay soldiers of fortune, the men who counted life well lost
for a thousand a year. Compared with such men, Bond decided,
these people were just teenage pillow-fantasies.</p>

<p class="pindent">The results went up for the third race, and now there was
only half an hour to go before The Perpetuities. Bond put down
his glasses and picked up his programme, waiting for the big
board on the other side of the track to start flickering as the
money went on the tote and the odds began to move.</p>

<p class="pindent">He took a final look at the details. ‘Second Day. August 4,’
said the programme. ‘The Perpetuities Stakes. $25,000 added.
52nd Running. For Three-Year-Olds. By subscription of $50
each, to accompany the nomination. Starters to pay $250 additional.
With the $25,000 added of which $5000 to second, $2500
to third and $1250 to fourth. A trophy to be presented to the
owner of the winner. One Mile and a Quarter.’ And then the
list of twelve horses with owners, trainers and jockeys and the
<span class="it">Morning Line</span> forecast of the odds.</p>

<p class="pindent">The joint favourites, No1, Mr C. V. Whitney’s Come Again,
and No3, Mr William Woodward’s Pray Action, were both
forecast at six to four on. Mr P. Pissaro’s Shy Smile, trainer
R. Budd, jockey T. Bell, was forecast at 15 to 1, the bottom
horse in the betting. His number was 10.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned his glasses on the restaurant enclosure. The two
men had gone. Bond’s eyes followed on across the track to
where the lights were flashing on the big board. The favourite
was now No3, at 2 to 1 on. Come Again had gone out to evens.
Shy Smile was quoted at 20 to 1, but he went down to 18s as
Bond watched the board.</p>

<p class="pindent">Another quarter of an hour to go. Bond sat back and lit a
cigarette, going over again in his mind what Leiter had told
him, wondering if it was going to work.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter had tracked the jockey down to his rooming house and
had flashed his private detective’s licence at him. And then he
had quite calmly blackmailed him into throwing the race. If
Shy Smile won, Leiter would go to the Stewards, expose the
ringer, and Tingaling Bell would never ride again. But there
was one chance for the jockey to save himself. If he took it,
Leiter promised to say nothing about the ringer. Shy Smile
must win the race but be disqualified. This could be achieved
if, in the final sprint, the jockey interfered with the running of
the horse closest to him so that it could be shown that he had
prevented this other horse from being the winner. Then there
would be an objection, which had to be upheld. It would be
easy for Bell, at the last corner before the run in, to do this in
such a way that he could argue to his employers that it had just
been a bit of over-keen riding, that another horse had crowded
him over to the left, that his horse had stumbled. There was no
conceivable reason why he should not wish to win (Pissaro had
promised him an extra $1000 if he did) and it was just one
of those strokes of bad luck that happen in racing. And Leiter
would now give Tingaling $1000 and there would be another
$2000 for him if he did what he was told.</p>

<p class="pindent">And Bell had bought it. Without any hesitation. And he had
asked for the $2000 to be passed to him after the day’s racing in
the Acme Mud and Sulphur Baths where he went every evening
to take a mud bath to keep his weight down. Six o’clock. And
Leiter had promised that this would be done. And Bond now
had the $2000 in his pocket and he had reluctantly agreed to
help Leiter out by going to the Acme Baths to make the payoff
if Shy Smile failed to win the race.</p>

<p class="pindent">Would it work?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond picked up his glasses and swept them round the course.
He noted the four thick posts at the quarter miles that held the
automatic cameras that recorded the whole race and whose film
was available to the Stewards within minutes of each finish.
It was this last one near the winning post whose eye would see
and record all that happened at the final bend. Bond felt a
tingle of excitement. Five minutes to go and the starting-gate
was being pulled into position a hundred yards up to his left.
Once round the course, plus an extra furlong, and the winning
post was just below him. He put his glasses on the big board.
No change in the favourites or in Shy Smile’s price. And now
here came the horses, cantering easily down to the start. First
came No1, Come Again, the second favourite. A big black horse
carrying the light blue and brown colours of the Whitney
Stable. And there was a cheer for the favourite, Pray Action,
a fast-looking grey carrying the Woodward white with red spots
of the famous Belair Stud, and, at the tail of the field, there was
the big chestnut with the blaze face and four white stockings,
and the pale-faced jockey wearing a jacket of lavender silk with
a big black diamond on chest and back.</p>

<p class="pindent">The horse moved so well that Bond glanced across at the
board and was not surprised to see his price come quickly back
to 17s, then 16s. Bond went on watching the board. In a minute
the big money would go on (all except the remains of Bond’s
$1000 which would stay in his pocket) and the price would
come down with a run. The loudspeaker was announcing
the race. Away to the left the horses were being marshalled
behind the starting-gate. Ping, ping, ping, the lights opposite
No10 on the board started to wink and flash—15, 14, 12, 11, and
finally 9 to 1. Then the lights stopped talking and the tote was
closed. And how many more thousands had gone away by
Western Union to harmless telegraphic addresses in Detroit,
Chicago, New York, Miami, San Francisco and a dozen more
off-the-course books throughout the States?</p>

<p class="pindent">A handbell clanged sharply. There was an electric smell in
the air, and a muting of the noise of the crowds. Then down
thundered the ragged charging line towards the grandstand and
past and away in a scud of hooves and flying earth and tanbark.
There was a glimpse of sharp, pale faces half-hidden by goggles,
a stream of pounding shoulders and hindquarters, a flash of
wild white eyes and a confusion of numbers amongst which
Bond caught only the vital No10 well to the fore and close in
to the rails. And then the dust was settling and the brown-black
mass was at the first corner and slowly streaming round the
bottom straight and Bond felt the glasses slip in the sweat round
his eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">No5, a black outsider, was leading by a length. Was this
some unknown horse that was going to steal the show? But
then there was No1 level with him and then No3. And No10
half a length behind the leaders. Just these four out in front and
the rest bunched three lengths away. Round the corner and
now No1 was in the lead. The Whitney black. And No10 was
fourth. Down the long straight opposite and No3 was moving
up—with Tingaling Bell on the chestnut at his heels. They both
passed No5 and were well up with No1 who was still leading
by half a length. And then the first top bend and the top
straight, and No3 was leading with Shy Smile second and No1
a length behind. And Shy Smile was coming up level with the
leader. He was level, and they were coming into the final corner.
Bond held his breath. Now! Now! He could almost hear the
whirr of the concealed camera in the big white post. No10 was
ahead, right on the bend, but No3 was inside on the rails. And
the crowd was howling for the favourite. Now Bell was inching
towards the grey, his head well down on his horse’s neck on
the outside, so that he could pretend that he couldn’t see the
grey horse on the rails. Inch by inch the horses drew closer and,
suddenly, Shy Smile’s head hid No3’s head, then his quarters
were in front and, yes, Pray Action’s boy suddenly stood right
up in his stirrups, forced to take-up by the foul, and at once
Shy Smile was a length ahead.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was an angry roar from the crowd. Bond lowered his
glasses and sat back and watched as the foam-flecked chestnut
thundered past the post below him with Pray Action five lengths
behind and Come Again just failing to beat him into second
place.</p>

<p class="pindent">Not bad, thought Bond, as the crowd howled around him.
Not bad at all.</p>

<p class="pindent">And how brilliantly the jockey had done it! His head so well
down that even Pissaro would have to admit Bell couldn’t see
the other horse. The natural curve-in for the final straight. The
head still well down as he passed the post and the whip flailing
for the last few lengths as if Tingaling still thought himself
only half a length ahead of No3.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond watched for the results to be posted. There was a chorus
of whistles and cat-calls. ‘No10, Shy Smile, five lengths. No3,
Pray Action, 1/2 length. No1, Come Again, three lengths. No7,
Pirandello, three lengths.’</p>

<p class="pindent">And the horses came cantering back for the weighing-in, and
the crowd yelled for blood as Tingaling Bell, grinning all over
his face, threw his whip to the valet and slipped off the sweating
chestnut and carried his saddle to the scales.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then there was a great burst of cheering. Opposite the
name of Shy Smile the word <span class="calibre3">OBJECTION</span>, white on black, had
been slipped in, and the loudspeaker was saying: “Attention
please. In this race there has been an objection lodged by Jockey
T. Lucky on No3, Pray Action, against the riding of Jockey T.
Bell on No10, Shy Smile. Do not destroy your tickets. I repeat,
Do not destroy your tickets.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took out his handkerchief and wiped his hands. He
could imagine the scene in the projection room behind the
judges’ box. Now they would be examining the film. Bell would
be standing there looking hurt, and, beside him, No3’s jockey
looking still more hurt. Would the owners be there? Would
the sweat be running down Pissaro’s fat jowls into his collar?
Would some of the other owners be there, pale and angry?</p>

<p class="pindent">And then came the loudspeaker again and the voice saying:</p>

<p class="pindent">“Attention please. In this race, No10, Shy Smile, has been
disqualified and No3, Pray Action, has been declared the winner.
The result is now official.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Amidst the thunder of the crowd, Bond got stiffly up from
his seat and walked off in the direction of the bar. And now
for the payoff. Perhaps a Bourbon and branch-water would give
him some ideas about getting the money to Tingaling Bell. He
was uneasy about it. And yet the Acme Baths sounded an easy
enough place. Nobody knew him in Saratoga. But after that he
would have to stop working for Pinkertons. Call up Shady Tree
and complain about not getting his five thousand. Worry him
about his own payoff. It had been fun helping Leiter push
these people around. Next would come Bond’s turn.</p>

<p class="pindent">He pushed his way into the crowded bar.</p>
