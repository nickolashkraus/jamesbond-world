<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>N the small red bus there was only a Negress with a withered
arm and, beside the driver, a girl who kept her sick hands
out of sight and whose head was completely shrouded in a thick
black veil which fell to her shoulders, like a bee-keeper’s hat,
without touching the skin of her face.</p>

<p class="pindent">The bus, which said ‘Acme Mud and Sulphur Baths’ on its
sides and ‘Every Hour on the Hour’ above the windscreen, went
through the town without picking up any more customers and
turned off the main road down a badly maintained gravel track
through a plantation of young firs. After half a mile, it rounded
a corner and went down a short hill towards a cluster of dingy
grey clapboard buildings. A tall yellow-brick chimney stuck up
out of the centre of the buildings and from it a thin wisp of
black smoke rose straight up into the still air.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was no sign of life in front of the Baths, but as the bus
pulled up on the weedy gravel patch near what seemed to be the
entrance, two old men and a limping coloured woman emerged
through the wire-screened doors at the top of the steps and
waited for the passengers to alight.</p>

<p class="pindent">Outside the bus the smell of sulphur hit Bond with sickening
force. It was a horrible smell, from somewhere down in the
stomach of the world. Bond moved away from the entrance and
sat down on a rough bench under a group of dead-looking firs.
He sat there for a few minutes to steel himself for what was
going to happen to him through the screen doors and to shake
off his sense of oppression and disgust. It was partly, he decided,
the reaction of a healthy body to the contact with disease, and
it was partly the tall grim Belsen chimney with its plume of
innocent smoke. But most of all it was the prospect of going in
through those doors, buying the ticket, and then stripping his
clean body and giving it over to the nameless things they did in
this grisly ramshackle establishment.</p>

<p class="pindent">The bus rattled off and he was alone. It was absolutely quiet.
Bond noticed that the two side windows and the entrance door
made two eyes and a mouth. The place seemed to be looking at
him, watching him, waiting for him. Would he come in? Would
they have him?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond moved impatiently inside his clothes. He got to his feet
and walked straight across the gravel and up the wooden steps
and the frame doors banged to behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">He found himself in a dingy reception room. The sulphur
fumes were stronger. There was a reception desk behind an
iron grill. Framed testimonials hung on the walls, some of them
with red paper seals below the signature, and there was a glass-fronted
showcase full of packages in transparent wrapping.
Above it a notice said, in badly handwritten capitals, ‘Take
Home an Acme-Pak. Treat Yourself in Privacy.’ There was a
list of prices pasted on to a card advertising a cheap deodorant.
The slogan still showed. It said: ‘Let your Armpits be your
Charm-pits.’</p>

<p class="pindent">A faded woman with a screw of orange hair above a face like
a sad cream-puff raised her head slowly and looked at him
through the bars, keeping one finger on her place in <span class="it">True Love
Stories</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Can I help you?” It was the voice reserved for strangers, for
people who didn’t know the ropes.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked through the bars with the cautious abhorrence
she had expected. “I’d like a bath.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Mud or Sulphur?” She reached for the tickets with her free
hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Mud.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Would you care for a book of tickets? They’re cheaper.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Just one, please.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Dollar fifty.” She pushed through a mauve ticket and kept
a finger on it until Bond had put his money down.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Which way do I go?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Right,” she said. “Follow the passage. Better leave your
valuables.” She slipped a large white envelope under the grill.
“Write your name on it.” She watched sideways as Bond put
his watch and the contents of his pockets into the envelope and
scribbled his name on it.</p>

<p class="pindent">The twenty hundred-dollar bills were inside Bond’s shirt. He
wondered about them. He pushed the envelope back. “Thank
you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You’re welcome.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a low wicket at the back of the room and two
white-painted wooden hands whose drooping index fingers
pointed right and left. On one hand was written <span class="calibre3">MUD</span> and on
the other <span class="calibre3">SULPHUR</span>. Bond went through the wicket and turned
to the right along a dank corridor with a cement floor which
sloped downwards. He followed it and pushed through a swing
door at the end and found himself in a long high room with a
skylight in the roof and cabins along the walls.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was hot and steamy and sulphurous in the room. Two
youngish, soft-looking men, naked except for grey towels round
their waists, were playing gin-rummy at a deal table near the
entrance. On the table were two ashtrays full of cigarette butts,
and a kitchen plate piled with keys. The men looked up as Bond
entered and one of them picked up a key from the plate and
held it out. Bond walked over and took it.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Twelve,” said the man. “Got ya ticket?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond handed it over and the man made a gesture towards the
cabins behind him. He jerked his head towards a door at the
end of the room. “Baths through there.” The two men went
back to their game.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was nothing in the frowzy cabin but a folded towel
from which constant washing had removed all the nap. Bond
undressed and tied the towel round his waist. He folded the
bulky packet of notes and stuffed them into the breast pocket of
his coat under his handkerchief. He hoped it would be the last
place that a petty thief would look in a quick search. He hung
up his gun in the shoulder holster on a prominent hook and
walked out and locked the door behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had no idea what he would see through the door at the
end of the room. His first reaction was that he had walked into
a morgue. Before he could collect his impressions, a fat bald
Negro with a down-turned straggling moustache came over and
looked him up and down. “What’s wrong with you, Mister?”
he asked indifferently.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Nothing,” said Bond shortly. “Just want to try a mud bath.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Okay,” said the Negro. “Any heart trouble?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Okay. Over here.” Bond followed the Negro across the slippery
concrete floor to a wooden bench alongside a pair of dilapidated
shower cubicles in one of which a naked body hung with
mud was being hosed down by a man with a cauliflower ear.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Be right with you,” said the Negro casually, his big feet
slapping against the wet floor as he sauntered off about his business.
Bond watched the huge rubbery man, and his skin cringed
at the thought of putting his body into the dangling pudgy
hands with their lined pink palms.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had a natural affection for coloured people, but he reflected
how lucky England was compared with America where
you had to live with the colour problem from your schooldays
up. He smiled as he remembered something Felix Leiter had
said to him on their last assignment together in America. Bond
had referred to Mr Big, the famous Harlem criminal, as ‘that
damned nigger’. Leiter had picked him up. “Careful now,
James,” he had said. “People are so dam’ sensitive about colour
around here that you can’t even ask a barman for a jigger of
rum. You have to ask for a jegro.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The memory of Leiter’s wisecrack cheered Bond up. He took
his eyes off the Negro and looked over the rest of the Acme
Mud Bath.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a square grey concrete room. From the ceiling, four
naked electric light bulbs, spotted with fly droppings, threw an
ugly glare on the dripping walls and floor. Against the walls
were trestle tables. Bond automatically counted them. Twenty.
On each table was a heavy wooden coffin with a three-quarter
lid. In most of the coffins the profile of a sweating face showed
above the wooden sides and pointed up at the ceiling. A few
eyes were rolled inquisitively towards Bond, but most of the
congested red faces looked asleep.</p>

<p class="pindent">One coffin stood open, its lid up against the wall and its side
hinged down. This seemed to be the one destined for Bond.
The Negro was draping a heavy, unclean-looking sheet over it
and smoothing it down to form a lining to the box. When he
had finished, he went to the middle of the room and chose two
from a line of pails filled to the top with steaming dark brown
mud, and dropped them with a double clang beside the open
box. Then he dug his huge hand into one of them and smeared
the thick viscous stuff along the bottom of the shroud and went
on doing this until the whole bottom of it was two inches thick
with mud. He then left it—to cool, Bond supposed—and went
to a dented hip-bath full of ice blocks and groped around and
extracted several dripping hand towels. He put these over his
arm and made a round of the occupied coffins, stopping every
now and then to wrap a cool towel round the sweating forehead
of one of the occupants.</p>

<p class="pindent">Nothing else was happening, and the room was quite silent
except for the hiss of the hose close to Bond. This stopped and
a voice said, “All right, Mr Weiss. That should fix you for
today,” and a fat naked man with a great deal of black body-hair
tottered weakly out of the shower cubicle and waited while
the man with the cauliflower ear helped him into a terrycloth
bath robe, gave him a quick rub down inside it, and led him
to the door through which Bond had come.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then the man with the cauliflower ear walked over to a door
in the far corner of the room and went out. For a few moments
light streamed through the door, and Bond saw grass outside
and a blessed glimpse of blue sky, and then the man came back
with two more steaming buckets of mud. He kicked the door
shut behind him and added to the line of buckets in the middle
of the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Negro went over to Bond’s coffin and touched the mud
with the flat of his hand. He turned and beckoned to Bond.
“Okay, Mister,” he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked over and the man took his towel and hung his
key on a hook above the box.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stood naked in front of him.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You ever had one of these before?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thought mebbe not, so I’m giving you the mud at 110. If
you’re acclimated, you can take 120 or even 130. Lie down
there.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gingerly climbed into the box and lay down, his skin
smarting at its first contact with the hot mud. He slowly
stretched himself out full length and lowered his head on to the
clean towel that had been placed over the kapok pillow.</p>

<p class="pindent">When he was settled, the Negro dug both hands into one of
the buckets of fresh mud and proceeded to slap it all over Bond’s
body.</p>

<p class="pindent">The mud was a deep chocolate brown and it felt smooth and
heavy and slimy. A smell of hot peat came up to Bond’s nostrils.
He watched the shining, blubbery arms of the Negro working
over the obscene black mound that had once been his body. Had
Felix Leiter known what this was going to be like? Bond
grinned savagely at the ceiling. If this was one of Felix’s
jokes. . . .</p>

<p class="pindent">At last the Negro had finished and Bond was loaded with hot
mud. Only his face and an area round his heart were still white.
He felt stifled and the sweat began to pour down his forehead.</p>

<p class="pindent">With a swift movement the Negro bent down and picked up
the edges of the sheet and wrapped them tightly round Bond’s
body and his arms. Then he reached up for the other half of the
dirty shroud and bound this also round him. Bond could just
move his fingers and his head, but otherwise he had less freedom
of movement than in a strait jacket. Then the man closed the
open side of the coffin, lowered the heavy wooden lid, and that
was that.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Negro took a slate down from the wall above Bond’s head
and glanced at a clock high up on the far wall and scribbled the
time down. It was just six o’clock.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Twenty minutes,” he said. “Feel good?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gave a neutral grunt.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Negro moved away about his business and Bond stared
dumbly up at the ceiling. He felt the sweat running down from
his hair into his eyes. He cursed Felix Leiter.</p>

<p class="pindent">At three minutes past six the door opened to admit the naked,
scrawny figure of Tingaling Bell. He had a sharp weasely face
and a miserable body on which each bone showed. He walked
cockily into the middle of the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Hi, Tingaling,” said the man with the cauliflower ear.
“Heard you had some trouble today. Too bad.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Them stewards is a heap of obscenity,” said Tingaling sourly.
“Why would I want to ride across Tommy Lucky? One of my
best pals. And why would I need to? The race was sewn up.
Hey, you black bastard,” he put out his foot to trip up the
Negro, who was passing with a pail of mud, “you got to get
six ounces off me. Just had me a plate of French fries. On top
of that they’ve given me a heap of lead to carry in the Oakridge
tomorrow.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The Negro stepped over the outstretched foot and chuckled
fatly. “Don’t worry, baby,” he said affectionately. “Ah kin
always break yo’ arm off. Get yo’ weight down easy dat way.
Be right with you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The door opened again and one of the card players put his
head in.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Hey, Boxer,” he said to the man with the cauliflower ear,
“Mabel says she can’t get on to the delicatessen to order your
chow. Phone’s busted. Line down or sumpn.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Aw Cheesus,” said the other. “Tell Jack to bring it on his
next ride.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Okay.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The door closed. A telephone breakdown in America is a rare
thing, and this was the moment when a small danger signal
might have shrilled in Bond’s mind. But it didn’t. Instead, he
looked at the clock. Another ten minutes in the mud. The Negro
sauntered across with the cold towels over his arm and wrapped
one round Bond’s hair and forehead. It was a delicious relief,
and Bond had a moment of thinking that perhaps the whole
business was just supportable.</p>

<p class="pindent">The seconds ticked by. The jockey, with a crackle of obscenities,
lowered himself into the box directly in front of Bond, and
Bond guessed that he was being given the mud at 130 degrees.
He was wound up in the shroud and the lid was banged shut
over him.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Negro wrote 6.15 on the jockey’s slate.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond closed his eyes and wondered how he was going to slip
the man his money. In the rest-room after the bath? There was
presumably somewhere one went to lie down after all this. Or
in the passage on the way out? Or in the bus? No. Better not in
the bus. Better not be seen with him.</p>

<p class="pindent">“All right. Nobody move now. Just take it easy and no one’ll
get hurt.”</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a hard, deadly voice that meant business.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s eyes snapped open and his body tingled at the reek of
danger that had come into the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">The door to the outside, the door through which the mud
came, was standing open. A man stood in the opening and
another man was advancing into the middle of the room. They
both had guns in their hands and they both had black hoods
over their heads with holes cut for the eyes and mouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was silence in the room except for the sound of water
falling in the shower cubicles. Each cubicle contained a naked
man. They peered out into the room through the veil of water,
their mouths gulping for air and the hair streaming into their
eyes. The man with the cauliflower ear was a motionless pillar.
His eyes shifted whitely and the hose in his hand poured water
over his feet.</p>

<p class="pindent">The moving man with the gun was now in the middle of the
floor by the steaming pails of mud. He stopped in front of the
Negro, who was standing with a full bucket in each hand. The
Negro quivered slightly so that the handle on one of the buckets
gave out a slight rattle.</p>

<p class="pindent">While the man with the gun held the Negro’s eyes in his, Bond
saw him turn the gun round in his hand so that he was holding
it by the barrel. Suddenly, with a back-handed blow that had all
his shoulder behind it, he lashed the butt of the revolver into
the centre of the Negro’s huge belly.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was only a sharp wet slap from the blow, but the
buckets crashed to the floor as the Negro’s two hands leapt up
and clutched at himself. He let out a soft moan and sagged forward
on to his knees, his glistening shaven head bowing down
almost to the man’s shoes so that he appeared to be worshipping
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man drew back a foot. “Where’s the jock?” he said
menacingly. “Bell. Which box?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The Negro’s right arm shot out.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man with the gun brought his foot down. He turned and
walked across to where Bond was lying toe to head with Tingaling
Bell.</p>

<p class="pindent">He came up and looked first down at Bond’s face. He seemed
to stiffen. Two glittering eyes looked down through the diamond
slits in the black hood. Then the man moved to the left and
stood over the jockey.</p>

<p class="pindent">For a moment he stood motionless, then he took a quick jump
and hoisted himself up so that he was sitting on the lid of Tingaling’s
box, looking down into his eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, well. Damifitaint Tingaling Bell.” There was a ghastly
friendliness in his voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Whatsamatter?” The jockey’s voice was shrill and terrified.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Why, Tingaling.” The man was reasonable. “What would
be the matter? Got anything on your mind?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The jockey gulped.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Mebbe you never heard of a horse called Shy Smile, Tingaling?
Mebbe you weren’t there when he was rode foul at around
2.30 this afternoon?” The voice ended on a hard edge.</p>

<p class="pindent">The jockey started to cry softly. “Jee-sus, Boss. That weren’t
my fault. Happen to anybody.” It was the whimper of a child
who is going to be punished. Bond winced.</p>

<p class="pindent">“My friends figure it may have been a double-cross.” The man
was leaning close over the jockey and his voice was gaining heat.
“My friends figure a jock like you could only done something
like that intentional. My friends looked over your room and
found a Grand plugged away in a lamp socket. My friends wish
me to inquire where that lettuce come from.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The sharp slap and the shrill cry were simultaneous.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Give, you bastard, or I’ll blow your brains out.” Bond heard
the click of the hammer going back.</p>

<p class="pindent">A stammering scream came out of the box. “My wad. All I
got. Hid it away in the lamp. My wad. I swear it. Christ, you
gotta believe me. You gotta.” The voice sobbed and implored.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man gave a disgusted grunt and lifted his gun so that it
came into Bond’s line of vision. A thumb with a big angry wart
on the first joint eased the hammer back. The man slipped down
off the box. He looked into the jockey’s face and his voice went
slimy.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You been riding too much lately, Tingaling,” he almost
whispered. “You’re in bad shape. Need a rest. Plenty of quiet.
Like in a sanitarium or sumpn.” The man slowly moved back
across the floor. He went on talking quietly and solicitously.
Now he was out of the jockey’s line of vision. Bond saw him
reach down and pick up one of the steaming buckets of mud.
The man came back, holding the bucket low, still talking, still
reassuring.</p>

<p class="pindent">He came up to the jockey’s box and looked down.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stiffened and felt the mud stir heavily on his skin.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Like I said, Tingaling. Plenty of quiet. Nothing to eat for a
whiles. Nice shady room with the drapes drawn to keep out the
light.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The soft voice droned on in the dead silence. Slowly the arm
came up. Higher, higher.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then the jockey could see the bucket and he knew what
was going to happen and he started moaning.</p>

<p class="pindent">“No, no, no, no, no.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Although it was hot in the room, the black stuff steamed as
it poured sluggishly out of the bucket.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man stepped swiftly aside and hurled the empty bucket
at the man with the cauliflower ear, who stood still and let it
hit him. Then he moved fast across the room to where the other
man with the gun stood near the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">He turned. “No funny business. No cops. Phone’s busted.”
He gave a harsh laugh. “Better dig the guy out before his eyeballs
fry.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The door banged, and there was silence except for a bubbling
sound and the noise of the water gushing in the shower.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_14">14<br class="lgl"/> <span class="gesp">“WE DON’T LIKE MISTAKES”</span></h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HEN what happened?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter was sitting in Bond’s chair in the motel and Bond
was pacing up and down the room, stopping every now and
then to take a drink from the glass of whisky and water by the
bed.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Bloody chaos,” said Bond. “Everybody yammering to be let
out of his box and the man with the cauliflower ear hosing the
stuff off Tingaling’s face and shouting for help to the two men
in the next room. The Negro moaning on the floor and the
naked guys from the showers teetering about like chickens with
their heads cut off. The two card-playing men came busting in
and they took the lid off Tingaling’s box and unwrapped him
and carried him under the shower. I guess he was nearly gone.
Half suffocated. Whole face puffed up with the burns. Ghastly
sight. Then one of the naked men pulled himself together and
went round opening the boxes and letting the people out and
then there we were, twenty men covered with mud and only
one shower to spare. It gradually got sorted out. One of the
help went off to drive into town for an ambulance. Someone
poured some water over the Negro, and he gradually came to
life. Without seeming too interested, I tried to find out if anyone
had any idea who the two gunmen were. No one had a clue.
It was thought they were from an out-of-town mob. Nobody
cared now that no one had got hurt except the jockey. All they
wanted to do was get the mud off themselves and get the hell
out of there.” Bond took another swallow of whisky and lit a
cigarette.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Was there anything that struck you about these two guys?”
asked Leiter. “Height, clothes, anything else?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I couldn’t see much of the man by the door,” said Bond. “He
was smaller than the other and thinner. Wearing dark trousers
and a grey shirt with no tie. Gun looked like a .45. Might have
been a Colt. The other man, the one who did the job, was a big,
fattish guy. Quick moving but deliberate. Black trousers. Brown
shirt with white stripes. No coat or tie. Black shoes, neat, expensive.
.38 Police Positive. No wrist-watch. Oh, yes,” Bond suddenly
remembered. “He had a wart on the top joint of his right
thumb. Red-looking as if he had sucked it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Wint,” said Leiter flatly. “And the other guy was Kidd.
Always work together. They’re the top torpedoes for the
Spangs. Wint is a mean bastard. A real sadist. Likes it. He’s
always sucking at that wart on his thumb. He’s called ‘Windy’.
Not to his face, that is. All these guys have crazy names. Wint
can’t bear to travel. Gets sick in cars and trains and thinks planes
are death traps. Has to be paid a special bonus if there’s a job
that means moving around the country. But he’s cool enough
when his feet are on the ground. Kidd’s a pretty boy. His friends
call him ‘Boofy’. Probably shacks up with Wint. Some of these
homos make the worst killers. Kidd’s got white hair although
he’s only thirty. That’s one of the reasons they like to work in
hoods. But one day that fellow Wint is going to be sorry he
didn’t have that wart burned away. I thought of him as soon as
you mentioned it. Guess I’ll get along to the cops and tip them
off. Won’t mention you, of course. But I’ll give them the lowdown
on Shy Smile, and they can work it out for themselves.
Wint and his friend’ll be taking a train in Albany by now, but
no harm in getting some heat on.” Leiter turned at the door.
“Take it easy, James. Be back in an hour and we’ll go and get
ourselves a good dinner. I’ll find out where they’ve taken Tingaling
and we’ll mail the dough to him there. Might cheer him up
a bit, the poor little bastard. Be seeing you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stripped and spent ten minutes under the shower,
lathering himself all over and washing his hair to get rid of the
last filthy memory of the Acme Baths. Then he dressed in
trousers and shirt and went over to the telephone booth in the
reception hall and put in a call to Shady Tree.</p>

<p class="pindent">“The line is busy, Sir,” chanted the operator. “Will I keep
the call in?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, please,” said Bond, relieved that the hunchback was
still in his office and that now he would be able to say truthfully
that he had tried to get through earlier. He had an impression
that Shady might be wondering why he hadn’t called up to complain
about Shy Smile. After seeing what had happened to the
jockey Bond was more inclined to treat the Spangled Mob with
respect.</p>

<p class="pindent">The telephone gave the dry muted burr that serves for a ring
on the American system.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Were you wanting Wisconsin 7-3697?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I have your party now, Sir. Go ahead, New York,” and the
high, thin voice of the hunchback: “Yes. Who’s calling?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“James Bond. I tried to reach you earlier.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Shy Smile didn’t pay off.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I know. The jockey bitched it. So what?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Money,” said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was silence at the other end. Then, “Okay, we start
again. I’ll wire you a Grand, the Grand you won off of me.
Remember?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Stand by the phone. I’ll call you back in a few minutes and
tell you what to do with it. Where you staying?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond told him. “Okay. You’ll get the money in the morning.
Be calling you shortly.” The phone went dead.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked over to the reception counter and glanced over
the rack of paperbacks. He was amused and rather impressed
by the meticulous accounting of these people and the care they
took to have each step of their operations protected by a legitimate
cover plan. They were right, of course. Where would he,
an Englishman, be able to get $5000 except by gambling? And
what would the next gamble be?</p>

<p class="pindent">The telephone crooked a mechanical finger at him and he
went into the box and closed the door and picked up the receiver.</p>

<p class="pindent">“That you, Bond? Now listen carefully. You’re to get it at
Las Vegas. Come down to New York and pick up a plane.
Charge the ticket to me. I’ll okay it. Through service to Los
Angeles and there’s a local plane every half hour to Vegas. You
have a reservation at the Tiara. Find your way around and—now
listen to this carefully—at just five after ten on Thursday evening
go to the centre of the three blackjack tables at the Tiara on
the side of the room near the bar. Got that?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sit down and play the maximum, that’s a Grand, five times.
Then get up and quit the table. And don’t gamble any more.
D’you hear me?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Your check is paid at the Tiara. After the game, hang
around and wait for further instructions. Got that? Repeat.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond did so.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Check,” said the hunchback. “Don’t talk and don’t make a
mistake. We don’t like mistakes. You’ll find that when you
read tomorrow’s paper.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a soft click. Bond put down the receiver and walked
thoughtfully across the lawn to his room.</p>

<p class="pindent">Blackjack! The old 21 of childhood days. It brought back
memories of big teas in other children’s playrooms; of grown-ups
counting out the coloured bone counters in piles so that each
child had a shilling’s worth; the excitement of turning up a ten
and an ace and being paid double; the thrill of that fifth card
when one already had seventeen and wanted a four or less for
‘Five and Under’.</p>

<p class="pindent">And now he was going to play the nursery game again. Only
this time the dealer would be a crook and the coloured counters
of his bet would be worth £300 on each hand. He had grown
up and now this would be a real grown-up game.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond lay down on his bed and stared at the ceiling. As he
waited for Felix Leiter, his mind was already reaching ahead to
the famous gambling town, wondering what it was going to be
like, wondering how much he would be able to see of Tiffany
Case.</p>

<p class="pindent">Five cigarette ends had piled up in the plastic ash-tray before
he heard Leiter’s limping step on the gravel path outside. They
walked across the lawn together to the Studillac and as they
drove down the avenue Leiter brought him up to date.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Spangled boys had all checked out—Pissaro, Budd, Wint,
Kidd. Even Shy Smile was already off on the first leg of his
long journey by horsebox right across the continent to the ranch
in Nevada.</p>

<p class="pindent">“The FBI are on the case now,” said Leiter, “but it will only
be one more short story in their collected works of Spang. Without
you as a witness, nobody’s going to have any idea who the
two gunmen were, and I’d be surprised if the FBI get very
worked up about Pissaro and his horse. They’ll leave that to me
and my outfit. I’ve talked to head office and they’ve told me to
get out to Vegas and somehow find out where the remains of
the real Shy Smile are buried. I’ve got to lay my hands on his
teeth. How d’ya like that?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Before Bond had time to comment, they had drawn up outside
the ‘Pavilion’, the only smart restaurant in Saratoga. They
got out and left the car to be parked by the doorman.</p>

<p class="pindent">“It’s good that we can have a meal together again,” said
Leiter. “You’ve never eaten broiled Maine lobster with melted
butter like they do it here. But it wouldn’t taste so good if there
was a chance that one of the Spang boys might be munching
spaghetti with Caruso sauce at the next table.”</p>

<p class="pindent">It was late and most of the diners had finished their meal and
gone off to the sales ring. They had a corner table to themselves
and Leiter told the head waiter not to hurry with the lobsters
but to bring two very dry Martinis made with Cresta Blanca
Vermouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">“So you’re going to Las Vegas,” said Bond. “Funny coincidence
department.” He told Leiter about his conversation with
Shady Tree.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sure,” said Leiter. “No coincidence about it. We’re both
travelling bad roads and all bad roads lead to the bad town.
I’ve got some cleaning up to do here in Saratoga first. And a
pile of reports to write. That’s half my life with Pinkertons,
writing reports. But I’ll be over in Vegas before the end of the
week, sniffing around. Shan’t be able to see much of you right
under the Spang nose, but maybe we could meet up from time
to time and exchange notes. Tell you what,” he added. “We’ve
got a good man there. Undercover. Cab-driver by the name of
Cureo, Ernie Cureo. Good guy, and I’ll pass the word you’re
coming and he’ll look after you. He knows all the dirt, where
the big fixes are, who’s in town from the outside mobs. He even
knows where you can find the one-armed bandits that pay the
best percentages. And the slots that pay best is the most valuable
secret on the whole goddam Strip. And Boy, you’ve seen nothing
until you’ve seen that Strip. Five solid miles of gambling joints.
Neon lighting that makes Broadway look like a kid’s Christmas
tree. Monte Carlo!” Leiter snorted. “Steam-age stuff.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled. “How many zeros have they got on the
Roulette?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Two, I guess.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“There’s your answer. At least we play against the right percentage
in Europe. You can have your neon lighting. The other
zero keeps it alight.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Maybe. But the craps only pay just over one per cent to the
House. And that’s our national game.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I know,” said Bond. “ ‘Baby needs a new pair of shoes’. All
that sort of kid’s talk. I’d like to hear the banker for the Greek
Syndicate whining ‘Baby needs a new pair of shoes’ when he’s
already got one nine against him at the high table and there are
ten million francs on each tableau.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter laughed. “Hell,” he said. “You’ve got it easy with this
crooked play-off at the blackjack table. You’ll be able to swank
around back in London and tell the story of how you took ’em
at the Tiara.” Leiter took a pull at his whisky and sat back in
his chair. “But I better give you some of the background to the
games just in case you get it into your mind to stake your pennies
against their pot of gold.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Go ahead.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“And I mean pot of gold,” continued Leiter. “You see, James,
the whole state of Nevada, which, so far as the public cares,
consists of Reno and Las Vegas, is the pot of gold at the end of
the rainbow. The answer to the public dream of ‘something for
nothing’ is to be picked up for the price of your plane fare, on
the Strip at Las Vegas or on the Main Stem at Reno. And it
really <span class="it">is</span> there. Not so long ago, when the stars and the dice were
right, a young GI made twenty-eight straight passes at a crap
table in the Desert Inn. Twenty-eight! If he’d started with a
dollar and been allowed to let it ride over the house limits which,
knowing Mr Wilbur Clark at the Inn, I guess he might not
have been, he would have made two hundred and fifty million
dollars! Of course he didn’t let it ride. Side-betters made a hundred
and fifty thousand dollars. The GI made seven hundred
and fifty dollars and took to his heels as if the devil was after him.
They never even got his name. Today that pair of red dice is on
a satin pillow in a glass case in the Desert Inn Casino.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Must have been good publicity.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Betcha life!” said Leiter. “All the ad men in the world
couldn’t have dreamed it up. It made the wishing-well dream
come true—and you wait till you see them wishing in those
casinos. In just one of them, they use up eighty pairs of dice
every twenty-four hours, a hundred and twenty packs of plastic
cards, fifty slot machines go to the garage every day at dawn.
And wait till you see the little old ladies in gloves working
those slots. They have shopping baskets to carry their nickels
and dimes and quarters. They work those slots ten, twenty
hours a day without going to the rest-room. You don’t believe
me? You know why they wear those gloves? To stop their
hands bleeding.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond grunted noncommittally.</p>

<p class="pindent">“All right. All right,” agreed Leiter. “Sure these people collapse.
Hysteria, heart attacks, apoplexy. The cherries and plums
and bells climb through their eyes into their brains. But all the
casinos have house physicians on twenty-four-hour call and the
little old women just get carried out screaming ‘Jackpot! Jackpot!
Jackpot!’ as if it was the name of a dead lover. And take a look
at the Bingo parlours, and the Wheels of Fortune, and the banks
of slots downtown in the Golden Nugget and the Horseshoe.
But don’t you go and get the fever and forget your job and your
girl and even your kidneys. I happen to know the basic odds at
all the games and I know how you like to gamble, so do me a
favour and get them into your thick head. Now you take them
down.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was interested. He took out a pencil and tore a strip off
the menu card.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter looked at the ceiling. “1.4 per cent in favour of the
House of Craps, 5 per cent at Blackjack”—he looked down at
Bond. “Except at your game, you crook!—5½ per cent at
Roulette. Up to 17 per cent at Bingo and the Wheel of Fortune,
and 15-20 per cent at the slots. Not bad for the House, hm?
Every year eleven million customers play Mr Spang and his
friends at those odds. Take two hundred dollars as an average
sucker’s capital, and you can work out for yourself how much
stays in Vegas over a year’s play.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond put the pencil and the piece of paper away in his pocket.
“Thanks for the documentation, Felix. But you seem to forget
that I am not going to this place for a holiday.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Okay, damn you,” said Leiter resignedly, “but don’t you go
fooling around in Vegas. It’s a big operation they’ve got there
and they won’t stand for any monkey tricks.” Leiter leant across
the table. “Let me tell you. The other day there was one of these
dealers. Blackjack, I think it was. Decided to go into business
for himself. Slipped a few bills into his pocket one evening during
the play. Well, they spotted him. Next day some innocent guy
is driving into town from Boulder City, and he spots something
pink sticking up out of the desert. Couldn’t be a cactus or anything,
so he stops and has himself a look.” Leiter prodded
Bond’s chest with a finger. “My friend, that pink thing sticking
up was an arm. And the hand at the top of the arm was holding
a full deck of cards, fanned out. The cops came with spades and
dug around and there was the rest of the guy under the ground
at the other end of the arm. That was the dealer. They’d blown
the back of his head off and buried him. The fancy work with
the arm and the cards was just to warn the others. Now how
d’ya like that?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Not bad,” said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">The dinner came and they started to eat.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Mark you,” said Leiter between mouthfuls of broiled lobster.
“The dealer should have known better than get caught with his
duke in the tambourine. They’ve got a good trick in these
Vegas casinos. Take a look at the ceiling lights. Very modern.
Just holes in the ceiling with the light beamed through on to
the tables. They throw a very strong light with no sideways
glare to upset the customers. Take another look and you’ll see
there’s no light coming from the alternate holes. They just seem
to be there to make a pattern.” Leiter slowly shook his head
from side to side. “Not so, my friend. Up on the floor above,
there’s a television camera on a dolly that moves around the
floor taking an occasional peek through those empty holes.
Kind of a spot-check on the play. If they’re wondering about
one of the dealers, or about one of the players, they’ll take a
picture of the whole of one session at that particular table and
every damn card or throw will be watched by the guys sitting
quietly upstairs. Smart, hm? These dumps are wired for everything
except smell. But the dealers know it, and this guy just
hoped the camera was looking somewhere else. Fatal error. Too
bad.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled at Leiter. “I’ll watch out,” he promised. “But
don’t forget I’ve somehow got to get another step down the
pipeline. To the tap at the end of it. In fact, I’ve got to get right
up close to your friend Mr Seraffimo Spang. I can’t do that by
just sending up my card. And I’ll tell you something else, Felix.”
Bond’s voice was deliberate. “I’ve suddenly taken against the
brothers Spang. I didn’t like those two men in hoods. The way
the man hit that fat Negro. The boiling mud. I wouldn’t have
minded so much if he’d just beaten the jockey up—ordinary
cops-and-robbers stuff. But that mud showed a nasty mind. And
I took against Pissaro and Budd. I don’t know what it is, but
I’ve just taken against all of them.” Bond’s voice was apologetic.
“Thought I ought to warn you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Okay,” Leiter pushed away his empty plate. “I’ll be around
and try and pick up the bits. And I’ll tell Ernie to keep an eye
on you. But don’t think you can ask for a lawyer or the British
Consul if you get in bad with the Mob. Only law firm out
there’s called Smith and Wesson.” He banged on the table with
his hook. “Better have one last Bourbon and branch-water. It’s
desert where you’re going. Dry as a bone and hotter’n hell at
this time of year. No rivers, so no branches to get the water out
of. You’ll be drinking it with soda and then mopping it off your
forehead. It’ll be one-twenty in the shade out there. Only there
isn’t any shade.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The whisky came. “I shall miss you out there, Felix,” said
Bond, glad to get away from his thoughts. “No one to teach me
the American way of life. And by the way, I thought you did
the hell of a fine job over Shy Smile. Wish you could come along
and tackle Spang senior with me. Together, I believe we could
take him.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter looked affectionately at his friend. “That sort of rough
stuff’s no good if you’re working for Pinkertons,” he said.
“I’m after the guy too, but I’ve got to get him legitimate. If I
can find out where the remains of the horse are buried, that
hoodlum’s going to have an ugly time. It’s all right for you
coming over here and tangling with him and getting away quick
back to England. The gang has no idea who you are. From
what you tell me they can never find out. But I’ve got to live
here. If I had a shooting match or anything of that sort with
Spang, his pals would get after me and after my family and
after my friends. And they wouldn’t rest until they’d hurt me
more than I ever hurt their pal. Even if I killed him. It’s not so
funny to come home and find your sister’s house burned down
with her inside it. And I’m afraid that could still happen in
this country today. The gangs didn’t go out with Capone. Look
at Murder Inc. Look at the Kefauver Report. Now the hoodlums
don’t run liquor. They run governments. State governments like
Nevada. Articles get written about it. And books and speeches.
Sermons. But what the hell.” Leiter laughed abruptly. “Maybe
you can strike a blow for Freedom, Home and Beauty with
that old rusty equalizer of yours. Is it still the Beretta?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes,” said Bond, “still the Beretta.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You still got that double 0 number that means you’re
allowed to kill?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes,” said Bond dryly. “I have.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well then,” said Leiter, getting up. “Let’s go home to bed
and give your shooting eye a rest. My guess is you’re going to
need it.”</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_15">15<br class="lgl"/> <span class="gesp">RUE DE LA PAY</span></h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE plane made a big curve out over the sparkling blue
Pacific and then swept round across Hollywood and gained
height so as to make the Cajon Pass through the great golden
cliff of the High Sierras.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond caught a glimpse of endless miles of palm-lined avenues,
of sprinklers whirling over emerald lawns in front of gracious
homes, of sprawling aircraft factories, of the outside lots of film
studios with their jumble of gimcrack sets—city streets, Western
ranches, what looked like a miniature motor-racing track, a full-size
four-masted schooner planted in the ground—and then they
were in the mountains and through them and over the interminable
red desert that is the backstage of Los Angeles.</p>

<p class="pindent">They flew over Barstow, the junction from which the single
track of the Santa Fe strides off into the desert on its long run
across the Colorado Plateau, skirting on their right the Calico
Mountains, once the borax centre of the world, and leaving far
away to the left the bone-strewn wastes of Death Valley. Then
came more mountains, streaked with red like gums bleeding
over rotten teeth, and then a glimpse of green in the midst of
the blasted, Martian landscape, and then a slow descent and
‘please fasten your seat-belts and extinguish your cigarettes’.</p>

<p class="pindent">The heat hit Bond’s face like a fist, and he had begun to sweat
in the fifty yards between his cool plane and the blessed relief
of the air-conditioned terminal building. The glass doors, operated
by seeing-eye photo-electric cells, hissed open as he
approached and slowly closed behind him, and already the slot-machines,
four banks of them, were right in his path. It was
natural to bring out the small change and jerk the handles and
watch the lemons and the oranges and the cherries and the bell-fruits
whirl round to their final click-pause-ting, followed by a
soft mechanical sigh. Five cents, ten cents, a quarter. Bond gave
them all a try, and only once two cherries and a bell fruit
coughed back three coins for the one he had played.</p>

<p class="pindent">As he moved away, waiting for the baggage of the half-dozen
passengers to appear on the ramp near the exit, his eyes caught a
notice over a big machine that might have been for iced water.
It said: <span class="calibre3">OXYGEN BAR</span>. He strolled over to it and read the rest:
<span class="calibre3">BREATHE PURE OXYGEN</span>, it said. <span class="calibre3">HEALTHFUL AND HARMLESS. FOR A
QUICK LIFT. EASES DISTRESS OF OVER-INDULGENCE, DROWSINESS,
FATIGUE, NERVOUSNESS AND MANY OTHER SYMPTOMS.</span></p>

<p class="pindent">Bond obediently put a quarter into the slot and bent over so
that his nose and mouth were enclosed in a wide black rubber
mouthpiece. He pressed a button and, as instructed, breathed in
and out slowly for a full minute. It was just like breathing very
cold air—no taste, no smell. At the end of the minute there was
a click from the machine and Bond straightened himself. He
felt nothing but a slight dizziness, but later he recognized that
there had been carelessness in the ironical grin he gave to a man
with a leather shaving kit under his arm who had been standing
watching him.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man smiled briefly back and turned away.</p>

<p class="pindent">The loudspeaker asked passengers to collect their luggage and
Bond picked up his case and pushed through the swing-doors of
the exit into the red-hot arms of noon.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You for the Tiara?” said a voice. A chunky man with large,
very direct brown eyes under a chauffeur’s peaked cap shot the
question at him from a wide mouth from which a wooden toothpick
jutted.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Okay. Let’s go.” The man didn’t offer to carry Bond’s suitcase
for him. Bond followed him over to a smart-looking Chevrolet
with a lucky raccoon tail tied to its chrome naked-lady mascot.
He threw his suitcase into the back and climbed in after it.</p>

<p class="pindent">The car moved off and out of the airport on to the parkway.
It crossed into the far lane and turned left. Other cars hissed by.
Bond’s driver kept to the inside lane, driving slowly. Bond felt
himself being examined in the driving mirror. He looked up at
the driver’s identification tag. It said, ‘<span class="calibre3">ERNEST CUREO.</span> No2584’.
And there was a photograph whose eyes also looked levelly at
Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">The cab smelled of old cigar smoke and Bond pressed down
the switch of the power-operated window. A furnace-blast of air
made him close it again.</p>

<p class="pindent">The driver half turned in his seat. “Don’t want to do that,
Mister Bond,” he said in a friendly voice. “Cab’s conditioned.
May not seem so, but it’s better’n outside.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thanks,” said Bond, and then: “I believe you’re a friend of
Felix Leiter.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sure,” said the driver, over his shoulder. “Nice guy. Told
me to watch out for ya. Be glad if I can do anything while ya’re
here. Staying long?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I can’t say,” said Bond. “Few days anyway.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Tell ya what,” said the driver. “Don’t think I’m trying to
gyp ya, but if we’re going to do some work together and ya got
some dough, mebbe ya better hire the cab by the day. Fifty bucks,
but I got to make a living. It’ll make sense to the front boys at
the hotels and so on. Don’t see otherwise how I’m to keep close.
Like that they’ll understand me hanging about waiting for ya
half the day. They’re a suspicious lot of bastards on the Strip.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Couldn’t be better.” Bond had at once liked and trusted the
man. “It’s a deal.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Okay.” The driver expanded a little. “Ya see, Mister Bond.
The folks round here don’t like anything out of the ord’nary.
What I say. They’re suspicious. I mean. Ya look like anything
’cept a tourist who’s come to lose his wad and they get a bad
case of nose trouble. Take yaself. Anyone can see ya’re a Limey
even before ya start talking. Clothes and so forth. Well, what’s
a Limey doing here? And what sort of a Limey is this? He looks
kind of a tough guy. So let’s just take a good look at him.” He
half turned. “Did ya see a feller hangin’ around the terminal
with a leather shaving kit under his arm?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond remembered the man who had watched him at the
Oxygen Bar. “Yes, I did,” he said, and it was then he realized
that the oxygen had made him careless.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Bet ya life he’s looking at ya pictures right now,” said the
driver. “Sixteen-millimetre camera in that shaving kit. Just pull
down the zip and press y’arm against it and off it goes. He’ll
have taken fifty feet. Straight and profile. And that’ll be with
Mug Identification at Headquarters this afternoon, with a list
of what ya got in ya bag. Ya don’t look as if ya’re carryin’ a gun.
Mebbe it’s a flat holster job. But if ya’re, there’ll be another man
with a gun alongside all the time ya’re in the rooms. Word’ll be
sent down the line by this evening. Better watch out for any
fellow with a coat on. Nobody wears ’em here save to house the
artillery.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, thanks,” said Bond, annoyed with himself. “I can see
I’ll have to keep a bit wider awake. Pretty good machine they
seem to have here.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The driver grunted affirmatively and drove on in silence.</p>

<p class="pindent">They were just entering the famous ‘Strip’. The desert on
both sides of the road, which had been empty except for occasional
hoardings advertising the hotels, was beginning to sprout
gas stations and motels. They passed a motel with a swimming
pool which had built-up transparent glass sides. As they drove
by, a girl dived into the bright green water and her body sliced
through the tank in a cloud of bubbles. Then came a gas station
with an elegant drive-in restaurant. <span class="calibre3">GASETERIA</span>, it said. <span class="calibre3">FRESH-UP
HERE! HOT DOGS! JUMBOBURGERS!! ATOMBURGERS!! ICE COOL
DRINKS!!! DRIVE IN</span>, and there were two or three cars being
served by waitresses in high-heeled shoes and two-piece bathing
suits.</p>

<p class="pindent">The great six-lane highway stretched on through a forest of
multi-coloured signs and frontages until it lost itself downtown
in a dancing lake of heat waves. The day was as hot and sultry
as a fire opal. The swollen sun burned straight down the middle
of the frying concrete and there was no shade anywhere except
under the few scattered palms in the forecourts of the motels. A
glittering gunfire of light-splinters shot at Bond’s eyes from the
windscreens of oncoming cars and from their blaze of chrome
styling, and he felt his wet shirt clinging to his skin.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Coming into the Strip now,” said the driver. “Otherwise
known as the ‘Rue de la Pay’. Spelt p.a.y. Joke. See?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Got it,” said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">“On ya right, The Flamingo,” said Ernie Cureo as they passed
a low-lying modernistic hotel with a huge tower of neon, now
dead, outside it. “Bugsy Siegel built that back in 1946. He came
over to Vegas from the coast one day and took a look round.
Had a lot of hot money looking for investment. Vegas was goin’
great guns. Town wide open. Gambling. Legalized cat-shops.
Nice set-up. It didn’t take long for Bugsy to catch on. He saw
the possibilities.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed at the pregnant phrase.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, Sir,” continued the driver, “Bugsy saw the possibilities
and moved right in. Stayed with it until 1947 when they blew
some of his head off with so many bullets the cops never got
around to finding them all. Then here’s The Sands. Plenty of
hot money behind that one. Don’t rightly know whose. Built a
couple of years ago. Front guy’s a nice feller name of Jack
Intratter. Used to be at the Copa in New York. Mebbe you heard
of him?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Afraid not,” said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well then, here’s The Desert Inn. Wilbur Clark’s place.
But the money came from the old Cleveland-Cincinnati combination.
And that dump with the flat-iron sign is The Sahara.
Latest thing. Listed owners are a bunch of small-time gamblers
from Oregon. Funny thing they lost $50,000 on their opening
night. Would ya believe it! All the big shots come
along with their pockets full of dough to make some courtesy
play, make the fust night a success, y’unnerstand. It’s a custom
here for the rival outfits to gather round at an opening. But boy,
the cards just wouldn’t co-operate and the opposition guys walked
off with fifty Grand! Town’s laffing about it still. Then,” he
waved to the left where the neon was wrought into a twenty-foot
covered wagon at full gallop, “Ya get The Last Frontier.
That’s a dummy Western town on the left. Worth seein’. And
over there’s The Thunderbird, and across the road’s The Tiara.
Snazziest joint in Vegas. Guess ya know about Mister Spang
and all that?” He slowed down and halted opposite the Spang
hotel, which was topped by a ducal coronet of brilliant lights
that winked on and off in a lost battle with the glaring sun and
the reflections from the highway.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, I know the outlines,” said Bond. “But I’d be glad for
you to fill them in some time. And now what?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Whatever ya say, Mister.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond suddenly felt he had had enough of the ghastly glitter
of The Strip. He only wanted to get indoors and out of the heat,
have some lunch and perhaps a swim and take things easy until
the night. He said so.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Suits me,” said Cureo. “Guess ya shouldn’t get into much
trouble ya first night. Take it easy though and act kinda natural.
If ya got work to do in Vegas ya better wait till ya know ya way
around. And watch the gambling, friend.” He chuckled. “Y’ever
hear of those Silence Towers they have in India? They say it
takes those vultures only twenty minutes to strip a guy to the
bones. Guess they take a bit longer at The Tiara. Mebbe the
Unions slow ’em down.” The driver banged the gear lever
into first. “All ’a same,” he said, watching the traffic in his
driving mirror, “there was one guy left Vegas with a hundred
Grand.” He paused, waiting for a chance to cross the parkway.
“Only thing, he had half a million when he started to play.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The car swung across the traffic and under the pillared portico
in front of the wide glass doors of the sprawling, pink stucco
building. The bell captain, in a sky blue uniform, opened the
cab door and reached in for Bond’s bag. Bond stepped out into
the heat.</p>

<p class="pindent">As he shouldered his way through the glass doors he heard
Ernie Cureo say to the captain: “Some crazy Limey. Hired me
for fifty bucks a day! Whaddya know about that?”</p>

<p class="pindent">And then the door swung to behind him and the beautiful cold
air welcomed him with a chill kiss into the glittering palace of
the man called Seraffimo Spang.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_16">16<br class="lgl"/> <span class="gesp">THE TIARA</span></h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">B</span>OND had lunch in the air-conditioned ‘Sunburst Room’ beside
the big kidney-shaped swimming pool (<span class="calibre3">LIFESAVER: BOBBY
BILBO—POOL SCOURED DAILY BY HYDRO JET</span>, said a sign) and having
decided that only about one per cent of the customers were fit to
wear bathing suits, walked very slowly through the heat across
the twenty yards of baked lawn that separated his building from
the central establishment, took off his clothes and threw himself
naked on his bed.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were six buildings containing the bedrooms of The
Tiara and they were named after jewels. Bond was on the
ground floor of ‘The Turquoise’. Its motif was egg-shell blue
with furnishing materials of dark blue and white. His room was
extremely comfortable and equipped with expensive and well-designed
modern furniture of a silvery wood that might have
been birch. There was a radio beside his bed and a television set
with a seventeen-inch screen beside the broad window. Outside
the window there was a small enclosed breakfast patio. It was
very quiet and there was no sound from the thermostat-controlled
air-conditioning and Bond was almost instantly asleep.</p>

<p class="pindent">He slept for four hours, and during this time the wire-recorder,
concealed in the base of the bedside table, wasted
several hundred feet of wire on dead silence.</p>

<p class="pindent">When he awoke it was seven. The wire-recorder noted that he
picked up the telephone and asked for Miss Tiffany Case and
after a pause said, “Would you please tell her that Mr James
Bond called” and put back the receiver. It then picked up the
noise of Bond moving about the room, the hiss of the shower
and, at 7.30, the click of his key in the lock as he went out and
shut the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">Half an hour later the recorder heard a knock on his door and
then, after a pause, the noise of the door opening. A man dressed
like a waiter, with a basket of fruit bearing a note saying, ‘With
the Compliments of the Management’, came into the room and
walked quickly over to the bedside table. He undid two screws,
removed the reel of fine wire on the recorder’s turntable, replaced
it with a fresh reel, put the basket of fruit on the dressing table
and went out and closed the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then for several hours the recorder whirred silently on,
recording nothing.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat at the long bar of the Tiara and sipped a Vodka
Martini and examined the great gambling room with a professional
eye.</p>

<p class="pindent">The first thing he noticed was that Las Vegas seemed to have
invented a new school of functional architecture, ‘The Gilded
Mousetrap School’ he thought it might be called, whose main
purpose was to channel the customer-mouse into the central
gambling trap whether he wanted the cheese or not.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were only two entrances, one from the street outside,
and one from the bedroom buildings and the swimming pool.
Once you had come in through either of these, whether you
wanted to buy a paper or cigarettes at the news stand, have a
drink or a meal in one of the two restaurants, get your hair cut
or have a massage in the ‘Health Club’, or just visit the lavatories,
there was no way of reaching your objective without passing
between the banks of slot machines and gambling tables.
And when you were trapped in the vortex of the whirring
machines, amongst which there sounded always, from somewhere,
the intoxicating silvery cascade of coins into a metal cup,
or occasionally the golden cry of “Jackpot!” from one of the
change-girls, you were lost. Beseiged by the excited back-chat
from the three big crap tables, the seductive whirl of the two
roulette wheels, and the clank of silver dollars across the green
pools of the blackjack tables, it would be a mouse of steel who
could get through without a tentative nibble at this delicious
chunk of lucky cheese.</p>

<p class="pindent">But, reflected Bond, it could only be a trap for peculiarly
insensitive mice—mice who would be tempted by the coarsest
cheese. It was an inelegant trap, obvious and vulgar, and the
noise of the machines had a horrible mechanical ugliness which
beat at the brain. It was like the steady clanking of the engines
of some old iron freighter on its way to the knacker’s yard, unoiled,
uncared for, condemned.</p>

<p class="pindent">And the gamblers stood and tore at the handles of the
machines as if they hated what they were doing. And, once they
had seen their fate in the small glass window, they didn’t wait
for the wheels to stop spinning but rammed in another coin and
reached up a right arm that knew exactly where to go. Crank-clatter-ting.
Crank-clatter-ting.</p>

<p class="pindent">And, when there was the occasional silvery waterfall, the
metal cup would overflow with coins and the gambler would
have to go down on her knees to scrabble about under the
machines for a rolling coin. For, as Leiter had said, they were
mostly women, elderly women of the prosperous housewife class,
and the droves of them stood at the banks of machines like hens
in an egg battery, conditioned by the delicious coolness of the
room and the music of the spinning wheels, to go on laying it
on the line until their wad was gone.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then, as Bond watched, a change-girl’s voice bawled “Jackpot!”
and some of the women raised their heads and the picture
changed. Now they reminded Bond of Dr Pavlov’s dogs, the
saliva drooling down from their jaws at the treacherous bell that
brought no dinner, and he shuddered at the thought of the
empty eyes of these women and their skins and their wet half-open
mouths and their bruised hands.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned his back on the scene and sipped at his Martini,
listening with half his mind to the music from the famous-name-band
at the end of the room next to the half-dozen shops. Over
one of the shops there was a pale blue neon sign which said ‘The
House of Diamonds’. Bond beckoned to the barman. “Mr Spang
been around tonight?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Ain’t seen him,” said the barman. “Mostly comes in after the
first show. Around eleven. You know him?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Not personally.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond paid his check and drifted over to the blackjack tables.
He stopped at the centre one. This one would be his. At exactly
five minutes past ten. He glanced at his watch. Eight-thirty.</p>

<p class="pindent">The table was a small, flat kidney of green baize. Eight players
sat on high stools facing the dealer, who stood with his stomach
against the edge of the table and dealt two cards into the eight
numbered spaces on the cloth in front of the stakes. The stakes
were mostly five or ten silver dollars, or counters worth twenty.
The dealer was a man of about forty. He had a pleasant half-smile
on his face. He wore the dealer’s uniform—white shirt
buttoned at the wrists, a thin black Western gambler’s tie, a
green eyeshade, black trousers. The front of the trousers was
protected from rubbing against the table by a small green baize
apron. ‘Jake’ was embroidered in one corner.</p>

<p class="pindent">The dealer dealt and handled the stakes with unruffled
smoothness. There was no talk at the table except when a player
ordered a ‘courtesy’ drink or cigarettes from one of the
waitresses in black silk pyjamas who circulated in the central
space inside the ring of tables. From this central space, the run
of the play was watched over by two tough lynx-eyed pit-bosses
with guns at their waists.</p>

<p class="pindent">The game was quick and efficient and dull. It was as dull and
mechanical as the slot machines. Bond watched for a while and
then moved away towards the doors marked ‘Smoking Room’
and ‘Powder Room’ on the far side of the Casino. On his way
he passed four ‘Sheriffs’ in smart grey Western uniform. The
legs of their trousers were tucked into half-Wellingtons. These
men were standing about unobtrusively, looking at nothing but
seeing everything. At each hip they carried a gun in an open
holster and the polished brass of fifty cartridges shone at their
belts.</p>

<p class="pindent">Plenty of protection around, thought Bond, as he pushed his
way through the swing-door of the ‘Smoking Room’. Inside, on
the tiled wall, was a notice which said, ‘Stand up Closer. It’s
Shorter than you Think’. Western humour! Bond wondered
if he dared include it in his next written report to M. He decided
it would not appeal. He went out and walked back through the
tables to the door beneath a neon sign which said ‘The Opal
Room’.</p>

<p class="pindent">The low circular restaurant in pink and white and grey was
half full. The ‘Hostess’ swept over and piloted him to a corner
table. She bent over to arrange the flowers in the middle of the
table and to show him that her fine bosom was at least half real,
gave him a gracious smile and went away. After ten minutes, a
waitress with a tray appeared and put a roll on his plate and a
square of butter. She also set down a dish containing olives and
some celery lined with orange cheese. Then a second and older
waitress bustled over and gave him the menu and said “Be right
with you”.</p>

<p class="pindent">Twenty minutes after he had sat down, Bond was able to order
a dozen cherrystone clams and a steak, and, since he expected a
further long pause, a second Vodka dry Martini. “The wine
waiter will be right over,” said the waitress primly and disappeared
in the direction of the kitchen.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Long on courtesy and short on service’, reflected Bond, and
resigned himself to the gracious ritual.</p>

<p class="pindent">During the excellent dinner that finally materialized, Bond
wondered about the evening ahead and about how he could
force the pace of his assignment. He was thoroughly bored with
his role as a probationary crook who was about to be paid off for
his first trial job and might then, if he found favour in the eyes
of Mr Spang, be given regular work with the rest of the teenage
adults who made up the gang. It irked him not to have the
initiative—to be ordered to Saratoga and then to this hideous
sucker-trap at the say-so of a handful of big-time hoodlums. Here
he was, eating their dinner and sleeping in their bed, while they
watched <span class="it">him</span>, James Bond, and weighed him up and debated
whether his hand was steady enough, his appearance trustworthy
enough and his health adequate to some sleazy job in one of
their rackets.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond munched his steak as if it was Mr Seraffimo Spang’s
fingers and cursed the day he had taken on this idiotic role. But
then he paused and went on eating more calmly. What the hell
was he worrying about? This was a big assignment which so
far had gone well. And now he had penetrated right to the end
of the pipeline, right into the parlour of Mr Seraffimo Spang
who, with his brother in London, and with the mysterious
ABC, ran the biggest smuggling operation in the world. What
did Bond’s feelings matter? It was only a moment of self-disgust,
a touch of nausea brought on by being a stranger who had spent
too many days too close to these sordidly powerful American
gangs, too close to the gunpowder-scented ‘gracious life’ of
gangland aristocracy.</p>

<p class="pindent">The truth of the matter, Bond decided over coffee, was that
he felt homesick for his real identity. He shrugged his shoulders.
To hell with the Spangs and the hood-ridden town of Las Vegas.
He looked at his watch. It was just ten o’clock. He lit a cigarette
and got to his feet and walked slowly across the room and out
into the Casino.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were two ways of playing the rest of the game, by lying
low and waiting for something to happen—or by forcing the
pace so that something <span class="it">had</span> to happen.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_17">17<br class="lgl"/> <span class="gesp">THANKS FOR THE RIDE</span></h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE scene in the big gambling room had changed. It was
much quieter. The orchestra had gone, and so had the droves
of women, and there were only a few players at the tables. There
were two or three ‘shills’ at the roulette, attractive girls in smart
evening dresses who had been given fifty dollars with which to
warm up the dead tables, and there was a very drunk man clinging
on to the high surrounding wall of one of the crap tables and
shouting exhortations to the dice.</p>

<p class="pindent">And something else had changed. The dealer at the centre
blackjack table nearest the bar was Tiffany Case.</p>

<p class="pindent">So that was her job at The Tiara.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then Bond saw that all the blackjack dealers were pretty
women and that they were all dressed in the same smart Western
outfit in grey and black—short grey skirt with a wide black
metal-studded belt, grey blouse with a black handkerchief round
the neck, a grey sombrero hanging down the back by a black
cord, black half-Wellingtons over flesh-coloured nylons.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked at his watch again and moved slowly into the
room. So Tiffany was going to false-deal him to win five thousand
dollars. And of course they had chosen the moment when
she had just come on duty and the first show of the big-name
revue was still running in The Platinum Room. He would be
alone with her at the table. No witnesses in case she muffed a
deal from the bottom of the pack.</p>

<p class="pindent">At exactly 10.5 Bond strolled easily up to the table and sat
down facing her.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Good evening.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Hi.” She gave him a thin, correct smile.</p>

<p class="pindent">“What’s the maximum?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“A Grand.”</p>

<p class="pindent">As Bond slapped the ten 100-dollar notes down across the
betting line, the pit-boss strolled over and stood beside Tiffany
Case. He barely glanced at Bond. “Mebbe the guy would like a
new deck, Miss Tiffany,” he said. He handed her a fresh pack.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl stripped the cover off it and handed him the used
cards.</p>

<p class="pindent">The pit-boss stood back a few paces and appeared to lose
interest.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl snapped the pack with a fluid motion of the hands,
broke it and put the two halves flat on the table and executed
what appeared to be a faultless Scarne shuffle. But Bond saw that
the two halves did not quite marry and that when she lifted the
pack off the table and carried out an innocent reshuffle she
would be getting the two halves of the pack back into their
original order. She repeated the manœuvre again and put the
pack down in front of Bond in an invitation to cut. Bond cut the
cards and watched with approval as she carried out the difficult
single-handed Annulment, one of the hardest gambits in card-sharping.</p>

<p class="pindent">So the ‘new’ deck was fixed and the only result of all this
fair play routine was to get all the cards back into the order in
which they were arranged when they left the wrappers. But it
was brilliant manipulation and Bond was full of admiration for
the assurance of the girl’s hands.</p>

<p class="pindent">He looked up into her grey eyes. Was there a hint of complicity
in them, a hint of amusement at the odd game they were
playing across the narrow green board?</p>

<p class="pindent">She dealt him two cards and then gave two to herself. Suddenly
Bond realized that he would have to be careful. He must
play the exactly conventional game or he might upset the whole
sequence in which the cards had been prepared.</p>

<p class="pindent">Printed across the table were the words ‘The Dealer Must
Draw on Sixteen and Stand on Seventeen’. They would presumably
have given him fool-proof winning cards, but just in
case there was another player or a kibitzer, they would have to
make his winning seem a natural run of luck and not, for
instance, just deal him twenty-one each time and seventeens to
the girl.</p>

<p class="pindent">He glanced at his two cards. A knave and a ten. He looked
up at the girl and shook his head. She turned up sixteen and
drew a card, busting herself with a king. She had a rack beside
her which contained only silver dollars and counters for twenty,
but the pit-boss was quickly at her side with a 1000-dollar plaque.
She took it and tossed it over to Bond. He put it over the line
and pocketed his notes. She flipped out two more cards to him
and two to herself. Bond had seventeen and again shook his
head. She had twelve and drew a three and then a nine—twenty-four
and bust again. Again the pit-boss stepped up with a plaque.
Bond slipped it into his pocket and left his original stake. This
time he had nineteen and she turned up a ten and seven on
which, by the rule, she had to stand. Another plaque went into
Bond’s pocket.</p>

<p class="pindent">The wide doors at the far end of the room had opened and a
stream of people were milling into the gambling room from the
dinner revue. Soon they would be round the tables. This was his
last play. After this he must get up from the table and leave her.
She was looking at him impatiently. He picked up the two cards
that she had given him. Twenty. And she also turned up two
tens. Bond smiled at the refinement. She quickly dealt him two
more cards just as three more players came up to the table and
hitched themselves up on the stools. He had nineteen and she
had sixteen.</p>

<p class="pindent">And that was that. The pit-boss didn’t even bother to hand
the girl the fourth plaque, but tossed it across the table to Bond
with an expression on his face that was very like a sneer.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Jee-sus,” said one of the new players, as Bond pocketed the
plaque and stood up.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked across the table at the girl. “Thank you,” he said.
“You deal beautifully.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’ll say!” said the player who had spoken.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiffany Case looked hard at Bond. “You’re welcome,” she
said. She held his eyes for a fraction of a second and then looked
down at her cards, shuffled them thoroughly, and handed them
to one of the new players for a cut.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned his back on the table and moved off round the
room, thinking of her, and occasionally glancing across at the
straight, imperious little figure in the exciting Western uniform.
Others obviously found her as attractive as Bond did, for soon
there were eight men sitting at her table and others standing
watching her.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond felt a pang of jealousy. He walked over to the bar and
ordered himself a Bourbon and branch-water to celebrate the
five thousand dollars in his pocket.</p>

<p class="pindent">The barman produced a corked bottle of water and put it
beside Bond’s ‘Old Grand-Dad’.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Where does this come from?” asked Bond, remembering
what Felix Leiter had said.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Over by Boulder Dam,” said the barman seriously. “Comes
in by truck every day. Don’t worry,” he added. “It’s the real
stuff.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond threw a silver dollar on the bar. “I’m sure it is,” he
said with equal seriousness. “Keep the change.”</p>

<p class="pindent">He stood with his back to the bar, and the glass in his hand,
deciding his next move. So now he had been paid off, and Shady
Tree had told him on no account to go back to the tables.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond finished his drink and walked straight across the room
to the nearest roulette table. There was only a sprinkling of
gamblers at it, playing small.</p>

<p class="pindent">“What’s the maximum here?” he said to the stick-man, an
elderly balding individual with dead eyes who was just picking
the ivory ball out of the wheel.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Five Grand,” said the man indifferently.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took the four plaques and the ten 100-dollar notes out of
his pocket and put them beside the croupier. “On Red.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The croupier sat up straighter in his chair and squinted sideways
at Bond. He tossed the four plaques one by one down on
to the Red, catching them there with his stick. He counted out
Bond’s notes, pushed them through a slot in the table, took a
fifth plaque from the rack of counters beside him and tossed
this down to join the others. Bond saw his knee go up under the
table. The pit-boss heard the buzzer and strolled over to the
table just as the croupier spun the wheel.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took out a cigarette and lit it. His hand was steady. He
felt a wonderful sense of freedom at having at last taken the
initiative from these people. He knew he was going to win. He
hardly glanced at the wheel as it slowed down and the little ivory
ball rattled into its slot.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thirty-six. Red. High and Even.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The stick-man raked in a few losing counters and silver dollars
and tossed some money down the table to the winners. Then he
took a thin plaque as big as a prayer-book out of his rack and
put it softly down beside Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Black,” said Bond. The man threw a single plaque for five
thousand dollars down on to Black and raked in Bond’s stake
from the Red.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a buzz of conversation round the table and several
more people drifted up and stood watching. Bond felt the
curious eyes on him, but he only looked across the table into the
eyes of the pit-boss. They were as hostile as an adder’s, and yet
somehow scared.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled blandly at him as the wheel whirred and there
was the whizz of the little ball as it set off on its journey.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Seventeen. Black. Low and Odd,” said the stick-man. There
was a sigh from the crowd and hungry eyes watched the big
plaque being slipped out of the rack and placed in front of Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">Once more, thought Bond. But not this turn.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’ll stay away,” he said to the croupier. The man glanced up
at Bond and then reached out with his rake and pulled in Bond’s
stake and handed it to him.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then there was another man inside the pit, standing beside
the pit-boss, and he was looking at Bond with bright, hard
eyes like camera lenses, and the fat cigar exactly in the centre of
his red lips was pointing straight at Bond like a gun. The big
square body in the midnight-blue tuxedo was quite motionless
and a sort of tense quietness exuded from it. It was a tiger watching
the tethered donkey and yet sensing danger. The face was
ivory pale, but there was a likeness to the brother in London in
the very straight, angry black brows and the short cliff of wiry
hair cut <span class="it">en brosse</span>, and in the ruthless jut of the jaw.</p>

<p class="pindent">The wheel whirred again and the two pairs of eyes bent to
watch it.</p>

<p class="pindent">It fell into one of the two green slots in the wheel and Bond’s
heart lifted at the escape he had had.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Double Zero,” said the stick-man, raking in all the money
on the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now for the last throw, thought Bond—and then out of here
with twenty thousand dollars of the Spang money. He looked
across at his employer. The two camera lenses and the cigar were
still trained on him, but the pale face was expressionless.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Red.” He handed a 5000-dollar plaque to the croupier and
watched it slither down the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">Would the last coup be asking too much of the wheel? No,
decided Bond with certitude. It would not.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Five. Red. Low and Odd,” said the croupier obediently.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’ll take the stake,” said Bond. “And thanks for the ride.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Come again,” said the stick-man unemotionally.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond put his hand over the four fat plaques in his coat pocket
and shouldered his way out of the crowd behind him and walked
straight across the long room to the cashier’s desk. “Three bills of
five thousand and five of ones,” he said to the man with the
green eyeshade behind the bars. The man took Bond’s four
plaques and counted out the bills and Bond put them in his
pocket and walked over to the reception desk. “Air mail
envelope, please,” he said. He moved to a writing-desk beside
the wall and sat down and put the three big bills in the envelope
and wrote on the front ‘Personal. The Managing Director, Universal
Export, Regents Park, London, N.W.1, England.’ Then
he bought stamps at the desk and slipped the envelope down the
slot marked ‘US Mail’ and hoped that there, in the most sacrosanct
repository in America, it would be safe.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond glanced at his watch. It said five minutes to midnight.
He surveyed the big room for the last time, noted that a new
dealer had taken over at Tiffany Case’s table, and that there was
no sign of Mr Spang, and then he walked out through the glass
door into the hot stuffy night and over the lawns to the Turquoise
building and let himself into his room and locked the
door behind him.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_18">18<br class="lgl"/> <span class="gesp">NIGHT FALLS IN THE PASSION PIT</span></h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">H</span>OW d’ya make out?”</p>

<p class="pindent">It was the next evening and Ernie Cureo’s cab was rolling
slowly along the Strip towards downtown Las Vegas. Bond
had got tired of waiting for something to happen, and he had
called up the Pinkerton man and suggested they get together for
a talk.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Not bad,” said Bond. “Took some money off them at
roulette, but I don’t suppose that’ll worry our friend. They tell
me he’s got plenty to spare.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Ernie Cureo snorted. “I’ll say,” he said. “That guy’s so loaded
with the stuff he don’t need to wear spectacles when he’s out
driving. Has the windshields of his Cadillacs ground to his eye-doctor’s
prescription.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. “What’s he spend it on besides that?” he asked.</p>

<p class="pindent">“He’s daft,” said the driver. “He’s crazy about the Old West.
Bought himself a whole ghost town way out on Highway 95.
He’s shored the place up—wooden sidewalks, a fancy saloon,
clapboard hotel where he rooms the boys, even the old railroad
station. Way back in ’05 or thereabouts, this dump—Spectreville
it’s called seeing how it’s right alongside the Spectre range—was
a rarin’ silver camp. For around three years they dug millions out
of those mountains and a spur line took the stuff into Rhyolite,
mebbe fifty miles away. That’s another famous ghost town.
Tourist centre now. Got a house made out of whisky bottles.
Used to be the railhead where the stuff got shipped to the coast.
Well, Spang bought himself one of the old locos, one of the old
‘Highland Lights’ if y’ever heard of the engine, and one of the
first Pullman state coaches, and he keeps them there in the
station at Spectreville and weekends he takes his pals for a run
into Rhyolite and back. Drives the train himself. Champagne
and caviar, orchestra, girls—the works. Must be something. But
I never seen it. Ya can’t get near the place. Yessir,” the driver let
down the side window and spat emphatically into the road,
“that’s how Mister Spang spends his money. Daft, like I said.”</p>

<p class="pindent">So that explained it, thought Bond. That was why he had
heard nothing from Mr Spang or his friends all through the
day. Friday, and they would all be out at the boss’s place playing
trains, while he had swum and slept and hung about the Tiara
all day waiting for something to happen. It was true that he had
caught an occasional eye shifting away from his, and there had
always been a servant of some sort, or one of the uniformed
sheriffs, hanging about in his neighbourhood, rather elaborately
doing nothing in particular, but otherwise Bond might have
been just any one of the hotel guests.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had caught a single glimpse of the big man, and the circumstances
had given him a perverse pleasure.</p>

<p class="pindent">At about ten o’clock in the morning, after a swim and breakfast,
Bond had decided to get a haircut at the barber’s shop.
There were still very few people about, and the only other
customer in the shop was a large figure in a purple terrycloth
bathwrap whose face, as the man lay tilted back in the chair, was
hidden beneath hot towels. His right hand, dangling down over
the arm of the chair, was being attended to by a pretty manicurist.
She had a pink and white doll’s face and a short mop of
butter-coloured hair and she squatted beside him on a low stool
with a bowl full of instruments balanced on the tips of her knees.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond, gazing into the mirror in front of his own chair, had
watched with interest as the head barber delicately lifted up first
one corner of the hot towels and then the other and with infinite
precaution snipped the hair out of the customer’s ears with
small, thin scissors. Before he replaced the edge of the towel over
the second ear, he bent down and said deferentially into it, “And
the nostrils, Sir?”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was an affirmative grunt from behind the hot towels
and the barber proceeded to open a window through the towels
in the neighbourhood of the man’s nose. Then he again went
cautiously to work with the thin scissors.</p>

<p class="pindent">After this ceremony, there was dead silence in the small white-tiled
room except for the soft clacking of the scissors round
Bond’s head and the occasional ting as the manicurist dropped
an instrument into her enamel bowl. And then there was a soft
creaking as the head barber carefully wound the handle of the
customer’s chair so that it came upright.</p>

<p class="pindent">“How’s that, Sir?” said Bond’s barber holding a hand-mirror
behind his head.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was as Bond was inspecting the back of his head that it
happened.</p>

<p class="pindent">Perhaps, with the changing elevation of the chair, the girl’s
hand slipped, but there was suddenly a muffled roar and the
man in the purple dressing-gown sprang out of his chair, tore
the towels off his face and plunged a finger into his mouth. Then
he took it out and bent quickly down and slapped the girl hard
across the cheek so that she was knocked off her stool and the
enamel bowl of instruments went flying across the room. The
man straightened himself and turned a furious face on the barber.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Fire that bitch,” he snarled. He put the hurt finger back in
his mouth and his slippers crunched amongst the scattered
instruments as he strode blindly out of the door and disappeared.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, Sir, Mr Spang,” said the barber in a stunned voice. He
started to bawl-out the sobbing girl. Bond turned his head and
said quietly, “Stop that.” He got up from his chair and unwrapped
the towel from round his neck.</p>

<p class="pindent">The barber gave him a surprised glance. Then he said quickly,
“Yes, Sir, Mister,” and bent to help the girl gather up her
instruments.</p>

<p class="pindent">While Bond paid for his haircut he heard the kneeling girl
say plaintively: “It weren’t my fault, Mister Lucian. He was
nervous today. His hands were trembling. Honest they were.
Ain’t never seen him like that before. Tension, sort of.”</p>

<p class="pindent">And Bond had had a moment of pleasure at the thought of
Mr Spang’s tension.</p>

<p class="pindent">Ernie Cureo’s voice broke sharply in on his thoughts. “We
got ourselves a tail, Mister,” he said out of the corner of his
mouth. “Two of ’em. Fore an’ aft. Don’t look back. See that
black Chevy sedan in front? With the two guys. They got
two driving mirrors and they been watching us and keeping step
for quite a whiles. Back of us there’s a little red sex-ship. Old
sports model Jag with a rumble seat. Two more guys. With
golf clubs in the back. But it just happens I know them guys.
Detroit Purple Mob. Coupla lavender boys. You know, pansies.
Golf ain’t their game. The only irons they can handle are in
their pockets. Just swivel y’eyes round as if you was admiring
the scenery. Watch their gunhands while I try ’em out. Ready?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond did as he was told. The driver put his foot on the
accelerator and simultaneously turned off the ignition switch.
The exhaust let go like an 88 millimetre and Bond saw the two
right hands dive into the two brightly-coloured sports jackets.
Bond casually turned his head back. “You’re right,” he said. He
paused. “Better let me out, Ernie. I don’t want to get you into
trouble.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Shucks,” said the driver disgustedly. “They can’t do nuthen
to me. Ya pay for any damage to the cab, and I’ll try and shake
’em. Okay?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took a 1000-dollar bill out of his note-case and leant over
and stuffed it into the pocket of the driver’s shirt. “There’s a
Grand to go on with,” he said. “And thanks, Ernie. Let’s see
what you can do.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond slipped his Beretta out of the holster and cradled it in
his hand. This, he thought to himself, was just what he had
been waiting for.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Okay, feller,” said the driver cheerfully. “I been looking for
a chance to take a poke at the gang. I don’t like being leant on
and they been leaning on me and some of my friends for too
long. Hold tight. Let’s go.”</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a straight stretch of road with not much traffic about.
The distant tops of the mountains were yellow in the setting
sun and the street was beginning to get blue with the fifteen
minutes of dusk when you can’t make up your mind whether to
switch on your lights.</p>

<p class="pindent">They were riding easily along at forty with the low-slung
Jaguar right on their tail and the black sedan a block ahead of
them. Suddenly, so that Bond pitched forward, Ernie Cureo put
his brakes full on and dry-skidded to a stop with a scream of
his tyres. There was a shattering splinter of metal and glass as the
Jaguar hit their fenders. The cab lurched forward against its
brakes and then the driver jammed it into gear and, with a
horrible tearing of iron, freed himself from the smashed radiator
of the car behind and accelerated away down the road.</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s ——ed them proper,” said Ernie Cureo with satisfaction.
“How they making out?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Bust radiator grill,” said Bond, watching out of the rear window.
“Both front wings flattened. Fender hanging off. Windshield
starred, maybe broken.” He lost the car in the dusk and
turned round. “They’re out on the road trying to pull the front
wings off the tyres. They may be able to go before long, but it
was a good start. Got any more like that?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Not so easy now,” grunted the driver. “War’s been declared.
Watch it. Better get down. The Chevy’s pulled up at the side
of the road. They may try some shootin’. Here we go.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond felt the car surge forward. Ernie Cureo was half lying
along the front seat, driving with one hand and with his eyes
watching the road ahead from just above the dash.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a clang and two sharp cracks as they flashed past
the Chevrolet. A handful of safety glass showered round Bond.
Ernie Cureo swore and the car gave a swerve and then got back
on its course.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond knelt on the back seat and knocked out the glass of the
rear window with the butt of his gun. The Chevrolet was
coming after them, its eyes blazing.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Hold it,” said Cureo with an odd muffled voice. “Goin’ to do
a sharp turn and stop under cover of the next block. Give ya
a clear shot as they come round after us.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond braced himself as the tyres screamed and the car lurched
on two wheels and then righted itself and stopped. Then he was
out of the door and crouching with his gun up. The lights of the
Chevrolet tore into the side road and there was a squeal of tortured
rubber as it made the turn on the wrong side. Now,
thought Bond, before he can straighten up.</p>

<p class="pindent">Crack—a pause. Crack. Crack. Crack. Four bullets, at twenty
yards, dead on the target.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Chevrolet didn’t straighten up. It went over the kerb
on the other side of the road, hit a tree broadside, bounced off
it and smashed into a lamp standard and turned completely
round and slowly toppled over on its side.</p>

<p class="pindent">As Bond watched it, waiting for the echoes of the smashing
metal to stop ringing in his ears, flames started to bleed slowly
from the chromium mouth of the car. Someone was scrabbling
at a window, trying to get out. At any moment the flames would
find the vacuum pump and run the whole length of the chassis
to the tank. And then it would be too late for the man inside.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had started across the road when there was a groan
from the front seat of the cab and he turned round to see Ernie
Cureo slip from under the wheel to the floor. Bond forgot the
burning car as he tore open the door of the cab and leant over
the driver. There was blood everywhere and the whole of the
driver’s left arm was soaked in it. Bond somehow hauled him
into a sitting position on the seat and the driver’s eyes opened.
“Oh, brother,” he said through clenched teeth. “Get me out of
here, Mister, and drive like hell. Next thing that Jag’ll be after
us. Then get me to a medic.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Okay, Ernie,” said Bond slipping behind the wheel. “I’ll
take care of it.” He rammed the car into gear and moved fast off
down the road and away from the blazing pyre and the
frightened people who had materialized out of the dusk and
were standing watching the flames, their hands up to their
mouths.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Keep goin’,” muttered Ernie Cureo. “This’ll get y’out near
the Boulder Dam road. See anything in the mirror?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“There’s a low-slung car with a spotlight coming after us
fast,” said Bond. “Could be the Jag. About two blocks away
now.” He stamped on the accelerator and the cab hissed through
the deserted side street.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Keep goin’,” said Ernie Cureo. “We gotta hide up some
place and let them lose us. Tell ya what. There’s a ‘Passion Pit’
just where this comes out on 95. Drive-in movie. Here we come.
Slow. Sharp right. See those lights. Get in there quick. Right.
Straight over the sand and between those cars. Off lights. Easy.
Stop.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The cab came to rest in the back row of half a dozen ranks
of cars lined up to face the concrete screen that soared up into
the sky and on which a huge man was just saying something to
a huge girl.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned and looked back down the lanes of metal standards,
like parking meters, from which speakers could be connected
with your car to pick up the sound. As he watched, one
or two cars drove in and ranged themselves in the rear rank.
Nothing low enough for a Jaguar. But it was dark now and
difficult to see and he stayed slewed round in his seat, his eyes
on the entrance.</p>

<p class="pindent">An attendant came up, a pretty girl, dressed as a pageboy, with
a tray slung round her neck. “That’ll be a dollar,” she said,
glancing into the car to see there was not a third customer on
the floor of the cab. She had pick-ups coiled over her right arm
and she took one off, plugged it into the nearest standard and
hung the small speaker through the window on Bond’s side. The
huge man and woman on the screen started talking heatedly.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Coco-Cola, cigarettes, candy?” asked the girl taking the note
Bond handed her.</p>

<p class="pindent">“No, thanks,” said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You’re welcome,” said the girl and sauntered off towards the
other late arrivals.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Mister, for Chrissake willya switch off that crap?” pleaded
Ernie Cureo through his teeth. “And keep watching. We’ll give
’em a whiles more. Then get me to a doc. Dig out the slug.”
His voice was weak and now that the girl had gone he was half-lying
with his head against the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Won’t be long, Ernie. Try and stick it.” Bond fiddled with
the speaker, found the switch and silenced the wrangling voices.
The huge man on the screen looked as if he was going to hit the
woman and her mouth gaped in a noiseless scream.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned and strained his eyes across the dark expanse
behind them. Still nothing. He glanced at the neighbouring cars.
Two faces glued together. A shapeless huddle on a back seat.
Two prim, rapt, elderly faces staring upwards. The glint of light
on an upturned bottle.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then a wave of musky after-shave lotion came up to his
nose and a dark figure rose up from the ground and a gun was
in his face, and a voice on the other side of the car beside Ernie
Cureo whispered softly, “Okay, fellers. Take it easy.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked into the suety face beside him. The eyes were
smiling and cold. The wet lips parted and whispered “Out,
Limey, or your pal’s cold turkey. My friend has a silencer. You
and we’re goin’ for a ride.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned his head and saw the black sausage of metal
against the back of Ernie Cureo’s neck. He made up his mind.
“Okay, Ernie,” he said, “better one than two. I’ll go with them.
I’ll soon be back to get you to the doc. Take care of yourself.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Funny guy,” said suet-face. He opened the door, keeping his
gun trained on Bond’s face.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sorry, friend,” said Ernie Cureo in a tired voice. “I guess . . .”
but then there was a sharp thud as the gun hit him behind the
ear and he slumped forward and was silent.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gritted his teeth and his muscles lumped under his coat.
He wondered if he could reach the Beretta. He glanced from
one gun to the other, measuring, adding up odds. The four eyes
above the two guns were greedy, longing for an excuse to kill
him. The two mouths were smiling, wanting him to try something.
He felt his blood cooling. He gave it another minute and
then, with his hands in sight, he stepped slowly out of the car
with murder tucked away in the back of his mind.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Go ahead to the gate,” said suet-face softly. “Look natural.
I got you covered.” His gun had disappeared, but his hand was
in his pocket. The other man joined them and his right hand
was at the waistband of his trousers. He ranged himself on
Bond’s other side.</p>

<p class="pindent">The three men walked swiftly towards the entrance and the
moon rising over the mountains straddled their long shadows in
front of them across the white sandy floor.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_19">19<br class="lgl"/> <span class="gesp">SPECTREVILLE</span></h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE red Jaguar was outside the entrance, up against the wall
of the enclosure. Bond let them take his gun and climbed in
beside the driver.</p>

<p class="pindent">“No funny tricks if you want to keep your head on straight,”
said suet-face, climbing into the rumble seat beside the golf
clubs. “There’s a gun on you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Nice little car you once had,” said Bond. The shattered windshield
had been lowered flat and a piece of chrome from the
radiator stuck up like a pennant between the two wingless front
tyres. “Where are we going in the remains?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You’ll see,” said the driver, a bony man with a cruel mouth
and sideburns. He swung the car out on to the road and accelerated
back towards the town, and they were soon in amongst the
jungle of neon and then through it and going fast down a two-lane
highway that ribboned away across the moonlit desert
towards the mountains.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a big sign which said ‘95’ and Bond remembered
what Ernie Cureo had told him and knew that he was on his
way to Spectreville. He hunched down in his seat to protect his
eyes from the dust and flies and thought about the immediate
future and how to revenge his friend.</p>

<p class="pindent">So these men and the other two in the Chevrolet had been
sent to bring him to Mr Spang. Why had four men been necessary?
Surely they were a rather heavyweight answer to Bond’s
defiance of his orders in the Casino?</p>

<p class="pindent">The car lapped up the dead-straight road with the needle of
the speedometer wavering around eighty. The telegraph poles
shifted by with the click of a metronome.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond suddenly felt that he didn’t know quite enough of the
answers.</p>

<p class="pindent">Was he completely exposed as an enemy of the Spangled Mob?
He could argue himself out of the game of roulette on the
grounds that he hadn’t understood his orders, and if he had
been a bit troublesome when the four men came for him, he
could at least pretend that he had thought it was a tail from a
rival mob. “If you wanted me, why didn’t you just call me in
my room?” Bond could hear himself saying in an injured tone
of voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">At least he had shown that he was tough enough for any job
Mr Spang might offer him. And in any case, Bond reassured
himself, he was just about to achieve his main objective—to get
to the end of the pipeline and somehow link Seraffimo Spang
with his brother in London.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond crouched, his eyes on the luminous dials in front of him,
and concentrated on the interview ahead and on wondering how
much useful evidence about the pipeline he could possibly extract
from it. Later, he thought about Ernie Cureo and the revenge
he owed him.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was not in his make-up to worry about how he himself was
going to get away once he had achieved these two objectives.
His own safety gave him no concern. He still had no respect for
these people. Only contempt and dislike.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was still rehearsing imaginary conversations with Mr
Spang when, after two hours’ driving, he felt the speed of the car
coming down. He lifted his head above the dashboard. They
were coasting up to a section of high wire fence with a gate in it
and a big notice lit up by their single spotlight. It said: <span class="calibre3">SPECTREVILLE.
CITY LIMITS. DO NOT ENTER. DANGEROUS DOGS.</span> The car drew
up below the notice and beside an iron post embedded in concrete.
On the post there was a bellpush and a small iron grill
and, written in red: <span class="calibre3">RING AND STATE YOUR BUSINESS</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">Without leaving the wheel, sideburns reached out and pressed
the button. There was a pause and then a metallic voice said
“Yes?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Frasso and McGonigle,” said the driver, loudly.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Okay,” said the voice. There was a sharp click. The high
wire gate slowly opened. They drove through and over an iron
strip in the narrow dirt road beyond. Bond looked back over his
shoulder and saw the gate close behind them. He also noticed
with pleasure that the face of, presumably, McGonigle, was
plastered with dust and the blood of dead flies.</p>

<p class="pindent">The dirt road continued for about a mile across the brutal,
stony surface of the desert in which an occasional clump of
gesticulating cactus was the only vegetation. Then there was a
glow ahead and they rounded a spur of mountain and went
down a hill and into a brightly lit straggling assembly of about
twenty buildings. Beyond, the moon glinted on a single railway
track which lanced off, straight as a die, towards the distant
horizon.</p>

<p class="pindent">They drew up among the grey clapboard houses and shops
marked <span class="calibre3">DRUGS, BARBER,</span> <span class="calibre3">FARMERS BANK</span> and <span class="calibre3">WELLS FARGO</span>, under a
hissing gaslight outside a two-storey building which said in faded
gold, <span class="calibre3">PINK GARTER SALOON</span>, and underneath, <span class="it">Beers and Wines</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">From behind the traditional sawn-off swing-doors, yellow
light streamed out on to the street and on to the sleek black and
silver of a 1920 Stutz Bearcat roadster at the kerb. There was the
sweet nasal twang of a honkey-tonk piano playing <span class="it">I Wonder
Who’s Kissing Her Now</span>, slightly flat. The music reminded
Bond of sawdust floors, nursed drinks and girls’ legs in the
widest mesh stockings. The whole scene was like something out
of an exceptionally well-mounted ‘Western’.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Out, Limey,” said the driver. The three men climbed stiffly
out of the car and on to the raised wooden sidewalk. Bond bent
to massage a leg that had gone to sleep, watching the feet of the
two men.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Come on, sissy,” said McGonigle, giving him a nudge with
his loosely held gun. Bond slowly straightened himself, measuring
inches. He limped heavily as he followed the man to the
door of the saloon. He paused as the swing-doors flapped back
into his face. He felt the prod of Frasso’s gun from behind.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now! Bond straightened himself and leapt through the still-swinging
door. McGonigle’s back was just in front of him and,
beyond, there was a brightly lit empty bar-room in which an
automatic piano was playing to itself.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s hands shot out and caught the man above the elbows.
He lifted him off his feet and swung him round and into the
swing doors and into Frasso, who was half-way through them.
The whole clapboard house trembled as the two bodies met and
Frasso fell back through the doors and crashed on to the sidewalk.</p>

<p class="pindent">McGonigle catapulted back and twisted to face Bond. There
was a rising gun in his hand. Bond’s left caught him on the
shoulder. At the same time his open right hand slapped down
hard on the gun. McGonigle went back on his heels against the
door jamb. The gun clattered to the floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">The snout of Frasso’s revolver appeared through the swing
doors. It weaved quickly round towards Bond, like an aiming
snake. As its blue-and-yellow tongue licked out, Bond, his blood
singing with the battle, dived for the ground and for the gun
at McGonigle’s feet. He got his hand on it and fired two quick
shots upwards from the floor before McGonigle stamped on his
firing hand and landed on top of him. As Bond went down, he
caught a glimpse of Frasso’s gun arced up between the swing
doors, pumping bullets into the ceiling. And this time the crash
of the body on the planking outside sounded final.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then McGonigle’s hands were at him and Bond was kneeling
on the ground with his head down, trying to protect his eyes.
The gun was still on the floor within reach of the first free hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">For seconds they fought silently, like animals, and then Bond
got to one knee and gave a great heave of his shoulders and
lashed upwards at the glimpse of a face and the weight came
off him and he rose to a crouch. As he did so, McGonigle’s
knee came up like a piston under Bond’s chin and knocked him
to his feet with a snap of the teeth that shook his skull.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had no time to clear his head before the gangster gave
a thick grunt and came for him head downwards with both arms
flailing.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond twisted to protect his stomach and the gangster’s head
hit him in the ribs and the two fists crashed into his body.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s breath whistled through his teeth with the pain, but
he kept focus on McGonigle’s head below him and, with a twist
of the body that put all his shoulder behind his hand, he whipped
in a hard left, and, as the gangster’s head came up, he lashed
out with his right to the chin.</p>

<p class="pindent">The impact of the two blows straightened McGonigle and
rocked him back on his feet. Bond was on him like a panther,
crowding him and raining in blows to the body until the gangster
began to sag. Bond grabbed at one weaving wrist and dived for
an ankle and yanked it away from the floor. Then he put out
all his strength, made almost a full turn to gather momentum,
and slung the body sideways into the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a first twanging crash as the flying figure hit the
upright pianola and then, with an explosion of metallic discords
and breaking wood, the dying instrument toppled over and, with
McGonigle spreadeagled across it, thundered to the floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">Amidst the diminishing crescendo of echoes, Bond stood in
the centre of the room, his legs braced with the last effort and
the breath rasping in his throat. Slowly he lifted one bruised
hand and ran it through his dripping hair.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Cut.”</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a girl’s voice and it came from the direction of the bar.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shook himself and turned slowly round.</p>

<p class="pindent">Four people had come into the saloon. They were standing in
line with their backs to the mahogany-and-brass bar behind
which ranks of gleaming bottles rose to the ceiling. Bond had
no idea how long they had been there.</p>

<p class="pindent">A step in front of the other three stood the leading citizen
of Spectreville, resplendent, motionless, dominant.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Spang was dressed in full Western costume down to the
long, silver spurs on his polished black boots. The costume, and
the broad, leather chaps that covered his legs, were in black,
picked out and embellished with silver. The big, quiet hands
rested on the ivory butts of two long-barrelled revolvers which
protruded from a holster down each thigh, and the broad, black
belt from which they hung was ribbed with ammunition.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Spang should have looked ridiculous, but he didn’t. His
big head was thrust slightly forward and his eyes were cold,
fierce slits.</p>

<p class="pindent">On Mr Spang’s right, with her hands on her hips, was Tiffany
Case. In a Western dress of white and gold, she looked like
something out of <span class="it">Annie Get Your Gun</span>. She stood and watched
Bond. Her eyes were shining. Her full red lips were slightly
parted and she was panting as if she had been kissed.</p>

<p class="pindent">The other half of the quartette was the two men in black
hoods from Saratoga. Each of them held a .38 Police Positive
trained on Bond’s heaving stomach.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond slowly took out a handkerchief and wiped his face with
it. He was feeling light-headed and the scene in the brilliantly lit
saloon, with its brass fittings and its homely advertisements for
long-vanished beers and whiskies, was suddenly macabre.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Spang broke the silence. “Bring him over.” The hard
jaws that operated the sharp, thin lips separated and cut off each
word as cleanly as a meat-slice. “And tell someone to call Detroit
and tell the boys they’re suffering from delusions of adequacy
up there. And tell ’em to send down two more. And tell ’em
they got to be better than the last lot. And tell someone else to
clean up this mess. Kay?”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a faint jingle of spurs on the wooden floor as Mr
Spang left the room. With a last look at Bond, a look that held
some message that was more than the obvious warning, the girl
followed him.</p>

<p class="pindent">The two men came up to Bond and the big one said “You
heard.” Bond walked slowly after the girl and the two men lined
up behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a door behind the bar. Bond pushed through it
and found himself in a station waiting-room with benches and
old-fashioned notices about trains and warning you not to spit on
the floor. “Right,” said one of the men and Bond turned through
a sawn-off swing-door and on to a plank station platform.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then Bond stopped in his tracks and hardly noticed a
sharp prod in the ribs from a gun barrel.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was probably the most beautiful train in the world. The
engine was one of the old locomotives of the ‘Highland Light’
class of around 1870 which Bond had heard called the handsomest
steam locomotives ever built. Its polished brass handrails
and the fluted sand-dome and heavy warning bell above the long,
gleaming barrel of the boiler glittered under the hissing gaslights
of the station. A wisp of steam came from the towering balloon
smoke-stack of the old wood-burner. The great sweeping cow-catcher
was topped by three massive brass lights—a bulging
pilot beam at the base of the smoke-stack and two storm lanterns
below. Above the two, tall driving wheels, in fine early Victorian
gold capitals, was written <span class="it">The Cannonball</span>, and the name was
repeated along the side of the black-and-gold painted tender
piled with birch logs, behind the tall, square driver’s cabin.</p>

<p class="pindent">Coupled to the tender was a maroon coloured state Pullman.
Its arched windows above the narrow mahogany panels were
picked out in cream. An oval plaque amidships said <span class="it">The Sierra
Belle</span>. Above the windows and below the slightly jutting barrel
roof <span class="it">Tonopah and Tidewater R.R.</span> was written in cream capitals
on dark blue.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Guess you never seen nuthen like that, Limey,” said one of
the guards proudly. “Now git goin’.” His voice was muffled
by the black silk hood.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked slowly across and stepped up on to the brass-railed
observation platform with the shining brakeman’s wheel
in the centre. For the first time in his life he saw the point of
being a millionaire and suddenly, and also for the first time, he
thought that there might be more to this man Spang than he
had reckoned with.</p>

<p class="pindent">The interior of the Pullman glittered with Victorian luxury.
The light from small crystal chandeliers in the roof shone back
from polished mahogany walls and winked off silver fittings and
cut-glass vases and lampstands. The carpets and swagged curtains
were wine-red and the domed ceiling, broken at intervals
by oval-framed paintings of garlanded cherubs and wreathed
flowers against a background of sky and clouds, was cream, as
were the slats of the drawn Venetian blinds.</p>

<p class="pindent">First came a small dining-room with the remains of a supper
for two—a basket of fruit and an open bottle of champagne in a
silver bucket—and then a narrow corridor from which three
doors led, Bond assumed, to the bedrooms and lavatory. Bond
was still thinking about this arrangement as, with the guards at
his heels, he pushed open the door into the state room.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the far end of the state room, with his back to a small open
fireplace flanked by bookshelves gleaming richly with gold tooled
leather bindings, stood Mr Spang. In a red leather armchair near
a small writing-desk half way down the car Tiffany Case sat bolt
upright. Bond didn’t care for the way she was holding her
cigarette. It was nervous and artificial. It looked frightened.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took a few steps down the car to a comfortable chair. He
turned it round to face them both and sat down and crossed one
knee over the other. He took out his cigarette case and lit a
cigarette and swallowed a deep lungful of smoke and let the
smoke come out between his teeth with a long, relaxed hiss.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Spang had an unlighted cigar jutting from the exact centre
of his mouth. He took it out. “Stay here, Wint. Kidd, get along
and do what I said.” The strong teeth bit the words off like
inches of celery. “Now you,” his eyes glittered angrily at Bond,
“who are you and what’s going on?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I shall need a drink if we’re going to talk,” said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Spang eyed him coldly. “Get him a drink, Wint.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond half turned his head. “Bourbon and branch-water,” he
said. “Half and half.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was an angry grunt and Bond heard the woodwork
creak as the heavy man walked back down the Pullman.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond didn’t much like Mr Spang’s question. He went back
over his story. It still looked all right. He sat and smoked and
looked at Mr Spang, weighing him up.</p>

<p class="pindent">The drink came and the guard thrust it into his hand so that
some of it slopped on to the carpet. “Thank you, Wint,” said
Bond. He took a deep swallow. It was strong and good. He took
another. Then he put the glass down on the floor beside him.</p>

<p class="pindent">He looked up again into the tense, hard face. “I just don’t
like being leant on,” he said easily. “I did my job and got paid.
If I chose to gamble with the money, that was my affair. I could
have lost. And then a lot of your men started breathing down
my neck and I got impatient. If you wanted to talk to me, why
didn’t you just call me on the telephone? Putting that tail on
was unfriendly. And when they got rude and started shooting
I thought it was time to do some leaning of my own.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The black-and-white face against the coloured books didn’t
yield. “You don’t get the message, feller,” Mr Spang said softly.
“Mebbe I better bring you up to date. Gotta coded signal yesterday
from London.” His hand went to the breast pocket of his
black Western shirt and he slowly pulled out a piece of paper,
holding Bond’s eyes with his.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond knew the piece of paper was bad news, really bad news,
just as surely as you do when you read the word “deeply” at the
beginning of a telegram.</p>

<p class="pindent">“This is from a good friend in London,” said Mr Spang. He
slowly released Bond’s eyes and looked down at the piece of
paper. “It says ‘Reliably informed Peter Franks held by police
on unspecified charge. Endeavour at all costs hold substitute
carrier ascertain if operations endangered eliminate him and
report’.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was silence in the car. Mr Spang’s eyes rose from the
paper and glittered redly down on Bond. “Well, Mister Whosis,
this looks like a good year for something horrible to happen
to you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond knew he was for it and part of his mind slowly digested
the knowledge, wondering how it was going to be done. But
at the same time another part told him that he had discovered
what he wanted to know, what he had come to America to find
out. The two Spangs did represent the beginning and the end of
the diamond pipeline. At this moment, he had completed the
job he had set out to do. He knew the answers. Now, somehow,
he must get the answers back to M.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond reached down for his drink. The ice rattled hollowly
as he took the last deep swallow and put the glass down. He
looked candidly up at Mr Spang. “I took the job from Peter
Franks. He didn’t like the look of it and I needed the money.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’t give me that crap,” said Mr Spang flatly. “You’re a
cop or a private eye of some sort and I’m going to find out who
you are, and who you work for, and what you know—what you
were doing in the Acme Baths alongside that crooked jock; why
you carry a gun and where you learnt to handle it; how come
you’re tied in with Pinkertons in the shape of that phoney cab-driver.
Things like that. You look like an eye and you behave
like one and,” he turned with sudden anger on Tiffany Case,
“how you fell for him, you silly bitch, I just can’t figure.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“The hell you can’t,” flared Tiffany Case. “I get handed the
guy by ABC and he acts okay. You think maybe I should have
told ABC to try again. Not me, brother. I know my place in
this outfit. And don’t think you can push <span class="it">me</span> around. And for
all you know this guy may be telling the truth.” Her angry eyes
swept over Bond and he caught the glint of fear, fear for him,
behind them.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, we’re going to find out,” said Mr Spang, “and go on
finding out until the guy croaks, and if he thinks he can take it,
he’s got another think coming.” He looked over Bond’s head at
the guard. “Wint, get Kidd and come back with the boots.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The boots?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat silent, gathering his strength and his courage. It
would be a waste of time to argue with Mr Spang or to try to
escape, fifty miles out in the desert. He had got out of worse
jams. So long as they didn’t intend to kill him yet. So long as he
gave nothing away. There was Ernie Cureo and there was Felix
Leiter. There might just possibly be Tiffany Case. He looked
across at her. Her head was bent. She was looking carefully at
her fingernails.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond heard the two guards come up behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Take him out on the platform,” said Mr Spang. Bond saw
the corner of his tongue come out and slightly touch the thin
lips. “Brooklyn stomping. Eighty percenter. Kay?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Okay, Boss.” It was the voice belonging to Wint. It sounded
greedy.</p>

<p class="pindent">The two hooded men came up and sat down side by side on
a dark red <span class="it">chaise longue</span> that ran down the car opposite Bond.
They put football boots down on the thick carpet beside them
and started to unlace their shoes.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_20">20<br class="lgl"/> <span class="gesp">FLAMES COMING OUT OF THE TOP</span></h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE black frogman’s suit fitted tightly. It hurt everywhere.
Why the hell hadn’t Strangways made certain the Admiralty
got his measurements right? And it was very dark under the sea
and the currents were strong, pulling him against the coral. He
would have to swim hard against them. But now something had
got him by the arm. What the hell. . . ?</p>

<p class="pindent">“James. For Chrissake. James.” She took her mouth away
from his ear. This time she pinched the naked bloodstained arm
as hard as she could and at last Bond’s eyes opened between their
puffed lids and he looked up at her from the wooden floor and
gave a shuddering sigh.</p>

<p class="pindent">She tugged at him, terrified that he would slip away from her
again. He seemed to understand and he rolled over and struggled
on to hands and knees, his head hanging down towards the
ground like a wounded animal.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Can you walk?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Wait.” The thick whisper coming through the cracked lips
sounded strange to him. Perhaps she hadn’t understood. “Wait,”
he said again, and his mind started exploring his body to see
what was left of it. He could feel his feet and his hands. He
could move his head from side to side. He could see the bars of
moonlight on the floor. He had been able to hear her. It ought
to be all right, but he just didn’t want to move. His will-power
had gone. He just wanted to sleep. Or even, to die. Anything to
lessen the pain that was in him and all over him, stabbing, hammering,
grinding him—and to kill the memory of the four boots
thudding into him, and the grunts coming from the two hooded
figures.</p>

<p class="pindent">Directly he thought of the two men and of Mr Spang, the will
to live came into Bond in a flood and he said “Okay”. And then
again “Okay” so that she would be sure to understand.</p>

<p class="pindent">“We’re in the waiting-room,” whispered the girl. “We must
get to the end of the station. Left, outside the door. Do you hear
me, James?” She reached out and brushed the damp, sticky hair
away from his forehead.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Have to crawl,” said Bond. “Follow you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl got to her feet and pushed open the door. Bond
gritted his teeth and crawled out on to the moonlit platform
and when he saw the dark patch on the ground, rage and revenge
gave him strength and he got clumsily to his feet, shaking
his head to keep the red-black waves from drowning him and,
with Tiffany Case’s arm round him, he limped along the wooden
boards to where they sloped down towards the ground beside
the gleaming rails.</p>

<p class="pindent">And there, in the single-line siding, was a railroad handcar.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stopped and gazed at it. “Petrol?” he said vaguely.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiffany Case gestured towards a row of cans against the station
wall. “Just filled her up,” she whispered back. “It’s what they
use for inspecting the line. And I can work it. And I shifted
the points. Hurry. Get aboard,” she giggled breathlessly. “Next
stop Rhyolite.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“My God, you’re a girl,” whispered Bond. “But there’ll be a
hell of a noise when we start that thing. Wait. Got an idea. Got
some matches?” Half his pain had fallen away from him. The
breath came fast through his teeth as he turned away from her
and focused on the silent, tinder-dry buildings.</p>

<p class="pindent">She was wearing slacks and a shirt. She dug into the pocket of
the slacks and handed him her lighter. “What’s the idea?” she
said. “We oughta be moving.”</p>

<p class="pindent">But Bond lurched over to the row of petrol tins and started
opening them and hurling the contents over the wooden walls
and platform. When he had emptied half a dozen cans he went
back to her. “Get her going.” He bent agonizingly down and
picked up a crumpled newspaper from beside the rails. There
was the angry whine of the self-starter and then the little two-stroke
engine caught and started hammering busily.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond flicked the lighter. The piece of paper flared and he
flung it away from him amongst the petrol cans. The whoosh
of flame almost caught him as he threw himself backwards on
to the little platform of the car. But then the girl let in the clutch
and the handcar started down the line.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a rattle and a sickening lurch at the points and
then they were out on the main line and the speedometer was
trembling at thirty and the girl’s hair was flowing back like a
golden banner towards him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned and looked back at the great bloom of flame they
had left behind them. He could almost hear the dry boards
crackling and the shouts of the sleepers as they dashed from their
rooms. If only it would get Wint and Kidd and catch the paint
on the Pullman and fire the wood in the tender of The Cannonball
and finish off the gangster’s box of toys!</p>

<p class="pindent">But he and the girl had their own problems. What time was
it? Bond gulped down the cool night air and tried to get his mind
to work again. The moon was low. Four o’clock? Bond hunched
his way painfully up the platform to the two bucket seats and
somehow scrambled over and got down beside the girl.</p>

<p class="pindent">He put an arm round her shoulders, and she turned and
smiled into his eyes. She raised her voice above the noise of the
engine and the hammer of the iron wheels on the rails. “That
was quite an exit. Like something out of an old Buster Keaton
film. How d’you feel?” She surveyed the battered face. “You
look terrible.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Nothing broken,” said Bond. “Suppose that’s what’s meant
by an eighty percenter.” He grinned painfully. “It’s better being
kicked than being shot.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl’s face cringed. “I just had to sit there and pretend
that I didn’t care. Spang stayed and listened and watched me.
Then they checked up on the ropes and slung you into the
waiting-room and everyone went happily to bed. I waited an
hour in my room and then I got busy. The worst part was trying
to wake you up.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond tightened his arm round her shoulders. “I’ll tell you
what I think of you when it doesn’t hurt so much. But what
about you, Tiffany? You’ll be in a jam if they catch up with
us. And who are those two men in the hoods, Wint and Kidd?
What are they going to do about all this? I wouldn’t mind seeing
a little more of those two.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl glanced sideways at the grim curl of the bruised lips.
“Never seen them without those hoods on,” she said truthfully.
“They’re supposed to be from Detroit. Strictly bad news. They
do the strongarm work and special undercover jobs. They’ll all
be after us now. But don’t you worry about me.” She looked up
at him again and her eyes were shining and happy. “First thing
is to get this crate to Rhyolite. Then we’ll have to find a car
somewhere and get over the state border into California. I’ve
got plenty of money. Then we’ll get you to a doctor and buy
you a bath and a shirt and think again. I got your gun. One of
the help brought it over when they’d finished picking up the
pieces of those two guys you wrassled with in the Pink Garter.
I collected it after Spang had gone to bed.” She unbuttoned her
shirt and dug into the waistband of her slacks.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took the Beretta, feeling the warmth of her on the metal.
He flicked out the magazine. Three rounds left. And one in the
breach. He replaced the magazine, put the gun on safe and
tucked it into the top of his trousers. For the first time he
realized that his coat was gone. One of his shirt sleeves hung in
tatters. He tore it off and threw it away. He felt for the cigarette
case in his right-hand hip pocket. It was gone. But in the left-hand
pocket there was still his passport and note-case. He pulled
them out. By the light of the moon he could see that they were
cracked and dented. He felt for his money in the note-case. It
was still there. He put the things back in his pocket.</p>

<p class="pindent">For a while they drove on with only the purr of the little
engine and the clickety-click of the wheels to break the looming
silence of the night. For as far as they could see, the thin silver
line of the rails spun on towards the horizon with only an occasional
break, marked by a points lever, where a rusty branch
line curved off into the dark mass of the Spectre Mountains on
their right. To their left, there was nothing except the endless
floor of the desert on which the hint of dawn was beginning to
edge the writhing cactus clumps with blue, and, two miles away,
the gun-metal shimmer of the moon on Highway 95.</p>

<p class="pindent">The handcar sang happily on down the rails. There were no
controls to bother with except a brake lever and a kind of joystick
with a twist-grip accelerator which the girl held fully open with
the speedometer steady at thirty. And the miles and the minutes
clicked by, and every now and then Bond turned painfully in his
seat and inspected the blossoming red glow in the sky behind
them.</p>

<p class="pindent">They had been going nearly an hour when a thin humming
undertone in the air or on the rails made Bond stiffen. Again he
looked back over his shoulder. Was there a tiny glow-worm
glimmer between them and the false red dawn of the burning
ghost town?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s scalp tingled. “D’you see anything back there?”</p>

<p class="pindent">She turned her head. Then, without replying, she slowed the
engine down so that they were coasting quietly.</p>

<p class="pindent">They both listened. Yes. It was in the rails. A soft quivering,
not more than a distant sigh.</p>

<p class="pindent">“It’s The Cannonball,” said Tiffany flatly. She gave a sharp
twist to the accelerator and the handcar sped on again.</p>

<p class="pindent">“What can she do?” asked Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Maybe sixty.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“How far to Rhyolite?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Around thirty.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond worked on the figures for a moment in silence. “It’s
going to be a near thing. Can’t tell how far away he is. Can you
get anything more out of this?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Not a scrap,” she said grimly. “Even if my name was Casey
Jones instead of Case.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“We’ll be all right,” said Bond. “You keep her rolling. Maybe
he’ll blow up or something.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, sure,” she said. “Or maybe the spring’ll run down and
he’s left the key of his engine at home in his pants pocket.”</p>

<p class="pindent">For fifteen minutes they sped along in silence and now Bond
could clearly see the great pilot-light of the engine cutting
through the night, not more than five miles away, and an angry
fountain above it from the woodsparks flaming out of the great
dome of the smoke-stack. The rails were trembling beneath
them and what had been a distant sigh was a low threatening
murmur.</p>

<p class="pindent">Perhaps he’ll run out of wood, thought Bond. On an impulse
he said casually to the girl, “I suppose we’re all right for gas?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, sure,” said Tiffany. “Put in a whole can. There’s no
indicator, but these things’ll run for ever on a gallon of gas.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Almost before the words were out of her mouth, and as if to
comment on them, the little engine gave a deprecating cough.
‘Put. Put-put.’ Then it ran merrily on.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Christ,” said Tiffany. “D’you hear that?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said nothing. He felt the palms of his hands go wet.</p>

<p class="pindent">And again. ‘Put. Put-put.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiffany Case gingerly nursed the accelerator.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, dear little engine,” she said plaintively. “Beautiful,
clever little engine. Please be kind.”</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Put-put. Put-put. Hiss. Put. Hiss . . .’ And suddenly they
were free-wheeling along in silence. Twenty-five, said the speedometer.
Twenty . . . fifteen . . . ten . . . five. A last savage twist
at the accelerator and a kick from Tiffany Case at the engine-housing
and they had stopped.</p>

<p class="pindent">“——,” said Bond, once. He got painfully out on to the side
of the track and limped to the petrol tank at the rear, pulling
his bloodstained handkerchief out of his trouser pocket. He
unscrewed the filler cap and lowered the handkerchief down so
that it must reach the bottom of the tank. He pulled it out and
felt it and sniffed it. Dry as a bone.</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s that,” he said to the girl. “Now just let’s think hard.”
He looked all round. No cover to the left, and two miles at
least to the road. On the right the mountains, perhaps a quarter
of a mile away. They might get there and hide up. But for how
long? It looked the best chance. The ground beneath his feet
was shaking. He looked down the line at the glaring, implacable
eye. How far? Two miles? Would Spang see the handcar in
time? Would he be able to stop? Might he be derailed? But
then Bond remembered the great jutting cow-catcher that would
sweep the light car out of the way like a bale of straw.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Come on, Tiffany,” he called. “We’ve got to take to the
hills.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Where was she? He limped round the car. She was running
back down the track in front. She came up panting. “There’s
a branch line just ahead,” she gasped. “If we can push the thing
there and you can work the old points, he might miss us.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“My God,” said Bond slowly. Then, with awe in his voice.
“There’s something better than that. Give me a hand,” and he
bent down and gritted his teeth against the pain and started
pushing.</p>

<p class="pindent">Once started, the car moved easily and they only had to follow
behind it and keep it rolling. They came to the points and Bond
went on pushing until they were twenty yards past.</p>

<p class="pindent">“What the hell?” panted Tiffany.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Come on,” said Bond, half stumbling, half running back to
where the rusty switch stuck up beside the rails. “We’re going
to put The Cannonball on to the branch line.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, boy!” said Tiffany Case reverently. And then they were
both at the switch and Bond’s bruised muscles were cracking as
he heaved.</p>

<p class="pindent">Slowly the rusty metal shifted in the bed where it had lain
unmoved for fifty years, and millimetre by millimetre the rails
showed a crack and then a widening gap as Bond strained and
jerked at the lever.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then it was done and Bond knelt on the ground with his
head down, fighting the dizziness that threatened to drown him.</p>

<p class="pindent">But then there was a glare of light on the ground and Tiffany
tugged at him and he was on his feet again and stumbling back
to the car and the whole air was full of thunder and the doleful
clanging of the warning-bell as the great flaming iron beast
came roaring towards them.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Get down and don’t move,” shouted Bond above the noise,
and he thrust her to the ground behind the flimsy shelter of the
handcar. Then he limped quickly to the side of the track and
drew his gun and stood sideways on with his pistol arm up like
a duellist and squinted back up the track into the great on-rushing
eye below the volcano of swirling fire and smoke.</p>

<p class="pindent">God, what a monster. Could it possibly take the curve?
Wouldn’t it just hurtle on into them and smash them to pulp?</p>

<p class="pindent">On it came.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Phut.’ Something whipped into the ground beside him and
there was a pinpoint flash from the cabin.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘B-o-i-n-g-g-g.’ There was another flash and the bullet hit the
rail and whined off into the night.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Crack. Crack. Crack.’ Now he could hear the gun above the
roar of the engine. Something sang sharply in his ear.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond held his fire. Only four bullets and he knew when they
would go.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then, twenty yards away, the flying engine thundered
into the curve and took the siding with a lurch that sent logs
hurtling towards Bond off the top of the tender.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a shrill scream of metal as the flanges on the six-feet-tall
driving wheels ground into the bend, a swift impression
of smoke and flame and pounding machinery, and then a
glimpse into the cabin and of the black-and-silver figure of
Spang, spreadeagled, clinging to the side of the cabin with one
hand and with the other hand outflung to the long iron handle
of the throttle lever.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s gun shouted its four words. There was a lightning
impression of a white face jerked up towards the sky and then
the great black-and-gold engine was past and hurtling towards
the shadowy wall of the Spectre Mountains, the beam of its
pilot-light scything at the darkness ahead and its automatic
warning-bell clanging sadly on, ding-dong, ding-dong, ding-dong.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond slowly tucked the Beretta into his trousers and stood
looking after the coffin of Mr Spang, and the trail of smoke
drifted over his head and for a moment put out the moon.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiffany Case came running to him and they stood side by side
and watched the flaming banner from the tall smoke-stack and
listened to the mountains throw back the echo of the charging
locomotive. The girl clutched his arm as the engine gave a sudden
swerve and vanished behind a spur of rock. And now there
was only a faraway drumming in the mountains and a red glow
that flickered off the crags as The Cannonball tore on down the
cutting into the belly of the rock.</p>

<p class="pindent">And suddenly there was a great tongue of fire and a terrible
iron crash as if a battleship had run on a reef. And then a
muffled clanging that seemed to come from under their feet.
And, finally, a deep distant boom from the bowels of the earth
and a barrage of miscellaneous echoes.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then, with the noise gone, a steady, singing silence.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond heaved a deep sigh as if he was just waking up. So that
was the end of one of the Spangs, of one of the brutal, theatrical,
overblown dead-end adults who made up the Spangled Mob.
He had been a stage-gangster, surrounded with stage properties,
but that didn’t alter the fact that he had intended to kill Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Let’s get away from here,” Tiffany Case said urgently. “I’ve
had enough of this.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond felt the pain creeping back into his body as his tension
relaxed. “Yes,” he said shortly. He was glad to turn his back
on the memory of the upturned white face in the beautiful
black, charging engine. He felt light-headed. He wondered if
he would make it. “We’ll have to get to the road. It’ll be hard
going. Come on.”</p>

<p class="pindent">It took them an hour and a half to cover the two miles and, by
the time he collapsed in the dirt beside the cement highway,
Bond was delirious. It was the girl who had got him there. But
for her he would never have kept a straight course. He would
have stumbled about amongst the cactus and rock and mica until
his strength was exhausted and the broiling sun came to finish
the job.</p>

<p class="pindent">And now she was cradling his head against her and talking
softly to him and wiping the sweat off his face with the corner
of her shirt.</p>

<p class="pindent">And every now and then she paused to look up and down the
dead-straight concrete road whose horizons were already shimmering
in the heat waves of early morning.</p>

<p class="pindent">An hour later she jumped to her feet and tucked in her shirt
and went and stood in the middle of the road. A low black car
was coming out of the dancing haze which hid the distant valley
of Las Vegas.</p>

<p class="pindent">It rolled to a stop just in front of her and a hawk-like face
under an untidy mop of straw-coloured hair stuck itself out of
the window. Keen grey eyes briefly looked her over. They
glanced at the prostrate figure of the man in the dust beside the
road and came back to her.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then, in a friendly Texan drawl, the driver said, “Felix
Leiter, Mam. At your service. And what may I do for you on
this beautiful morning?”</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_21">21<br class="lgl"/> <span class="gesp">“NOTHING PROPINKS LIKE PROPINQUITY”</span></h1></div>

<p class="noindent">“. . . . and when I get into town I call my friend Ernie Cureo.
James knows him. And his wife is having hysterics and Ernie’s
in the hospital. So I go right along and he tells me the score and
I figure that James may need some reinforcements. So I jump
on my coal-black mare and gallop through the night and when
I get near to Spectreville I see the light in the sky. Mr Spang’s
having himself a barbecue, I figure. And the gate in the fence is
open so I decide to join the feast. Well, believe me or believe me
not, there’s not a soul in the place except a guy with a busted leg
and multiple contusions, who’s crawling down the road trying
to get away. And he looks to me mighty like a young hood called
Frasso from Detroit Ernie Cureo tells me was one of the guys
that took James. The fellow’s in no state to deny this and I more
or less get the picture and I figure that Rhyolite’s my next stop.
So I tell the kid he’ll soon be having plenty of company from
the Fire Department and I take him to the gate and leave him
there and then after a while there’s a girl standing in the middle
of the desert looking as if she’s been fired out of a cannon and
here we all are. And now you tell.”</p>

<p class="pindent">So it’s <span class="it">not</span> all part of a dream and I <span class="it">am</span> lying in the back of
the Studillac and this <span class="it">is</span> Tiffany’s lap under my head and that <span class="it">is</span>
Felix and we <span class="it">are</span> going hell for leather down the road to safety,
a doctor, a bath, some food and drink and an endless amount of
sleep. Bond moved and he felt Tiffany’s hand in his hair to tell
it was all real and just like he hoped, and he lay still again and
said nothing and held each moment to him and listened to their
voices and the zip of the tyres on the road.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the end of Tiffany’s story, Felix Leiter gave a reverent
whistle. “Jeese, Mam,” he said. “The two of you sure seem to
have busted a hole in the Spangled Mob. What in hell’s going
to happen now? There are plenty of other hornets in the nest
and just sittin’ around buzzin’ isn’t goin’ to be their way. They’ll
want some action.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Check,” said Tiffany. “Spang was a member of the Syndicate
at Vegas and these guys stick pretty much together. Then there’s
Shady Tree and those two torpedoes, Wint and Kidd, whoever
they may be. The sooner we cross the State-line the better. Then
what?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“We’re doin’ all right so far,” said Felix Leiter. “Be at Beatty
in ten minutes, then we’ll get on to 58 and be over the line in
half an hour. Then there’s a long ride through Death Valley
and over the mountains down to Olancha where we hit No6.
We could stop there and get James to a doc and do some eating
and cleaning up. Then just stay on 6 until we get to LA. It’ll be
a hell of a drive, but we should make LA by lunchtime. Then
we can relax a bit and think again. My guess is that we oughta
get you and James out of the country pretty quick. The boys’ll
try and fix all kinds of phoney raps on you both, and once you’re
located I wouldn’t give a nickel for either of you. Best chance
would be to get you both on a plane to New York tonight and
off to England tomorrow. James can take it from there.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I guess that makes sense,” said the girl. “But who is this
Bond guy, anyway? What’s his racket? Is he an eye?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You better ask him yourself, Mam,” Bond heard Leiter say
carefully. “But I wouldn’t let that worry you over much. He’ll
take care of you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled to himself and in the long silence that followed
he dropped off into an uneasy sleep which lasted until they were
half way across California and had pulled up outside a white
wicket gate that said ‘Otis Fairplay, <span class="calibre3">MD</span>’.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then, a mass of surgical tape and streaked with mercurochrome,
washed and shaved and with a huge breakfast inside
him, he was back in the car and back in the world and Tiffany
Case had withdrawn into her old ironical and uncompromising
manner and Bond was making himself useful by watching for
speed cops as Leiter kept the car in the eighties down the endless
dazzling road towards the distant cloudline that hid the High
Sierras.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then they were rolling easily along Sunset Boulevard between
the palm trees and the emerald lawns, the dust-streaked Studillac
looking incongruous among the glistening Corvettes and
Jaguars, and finally, towards evening, they were sitting in the
dark, cool bar of the Beverly Hills Hotel, and there were new
suitcases in the lobby and brand new Hollywood clothes and
even Bond’s battle-scarred face didn’t mean they hadn’t all just
finished work at the studios.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a telephone on the table beside their Martinis. Felix
Leiter finished talking to New York for the fourth time since
their arrival.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well that’s fixed,” he said, putting back the receiver. “My
pals at the office have got you on the <span class="it">Elizabeth</span>. Been delayed
by a strike at the docks. Sails tomorrow night at eight. They’ll
meet you in the morning at La Guardia with the tickets and
you’ll go on board any time in the afternoon. They picked up
the rest of your things at the Astor, James. One small case and
your famous golf clubs. And Washington’s obliged with a passport
for Tiffany. There’ll be a man from the State Department
at the airport. You’ll both have some forms to sign. Got one of
my old pals at the CIA to work it. The middays have made a
big splash with the story—‘Ghost Town goes West’ and so on—but
they don’t seem to have found our friend Spang yet and
your names don’t figure. My boys say there’s no call out for you
with the cops, but one of our undercover men says the gangs are
looking for you and your description’s been circulated. Ten
Grand attached. So it’s as well you’re skipping quick. Better go
aboard separately. Cover up as much as you can and go down to
your cabins and stay there. All hell’s going to bust loose when
they get to the bottom of that old mine. That’ll make leastwise
three corpses to nothing and they don’t like that kind of score.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Pinkertons seem to have quite a machine,” said Bond with
admiration. “But I’ll be glad when we’re both out of here. I
used to think your gangsters were just a bunch of Italian greaseballs
who filled themselves up with pizza pie and beer all the
week and on Saturdays knocked off a garage or a drug store so
as to pay their way at the races. But they’ve certainly got plenty
of violence on the payroll.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiffany Case laughed derisively. “You ought to get your head
examined,” she said flatly. “If we make the <span class="it">Lizzie</span> all in one
piece, it’ll be a miracle. That’s how good they are. Thanks to
Captain Hook here we’ve got a chance, but it’s not more than
that. Greaseballs!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Felix Leiter chuckled. “Come on, lovebirds,” he said, looking
at his watch. “We ought to get going. I’ve got to get back to
Vegas tonight and start looking for the skeleton of our old dumb
friend Shy Smile. And you’ve got your plane to catch. You can
go on fighting at twenty thousand feet. Get a better perspective
from there. May even decide to make up and be friends. You
know how they say.” He beckoned to the waiter. “Nothing propinks
like propinquity.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter drove them out to the airport and dropped them there.
Bond felt a lump in his throat when the lanky figure limped off
to his car after being warmly embraced by Tiffany Case.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You got yourself a good pal there,” said the girl as they
watched Leiter slam the door and heard the deep boom of the
exhaust as he accelerated away on his long drive back into the
desert.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes,” said Bond. “Felix is all right.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was the glint of moonlight on the steel hook as Leiter
waved a last goodbye and then there was the dust settling on
the road and the iron voice of the loudspeakers saying “Trans-World
Airlines, Flight 93, now loading at Gate No5 for Chicago
and New York. All aboard, please,” and they pushed their way
through the glass doors and took the first steps of their long
journey half way across the world to London.</p>

<p class="pindent">The new Super-G Constellation roared over the darkened
continent and Bond lay in his comfortable bunk waiting for
sleep to carry away his aching body and thinking of Tiffany,
asleep in the bunk below, and of where he stood with his assignment.</p>

<p class="pindent">He thought of the lovely face cradled on the open hand below
him, innocent and defenceless in sleep, the scorn gone from the
level grey eyes and the ironical droop from the corners of the
passionate mouth, and Bond knew that he was very near to being
in love with her. And what about her? How strong was this
masculine protest that had been born on that night in San Francisco
when the men had broken into her room and taken her?
Would the child and the woman ever come out from behind the
barricade she had started to build that night against all the men
in the world? Would she ever come out of the shell that had
hardened with each year of solitude and withdrawal?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond remembered moments in the last twenty-four hours
when he had known the answer, moments when a warm passionate
girl had looked out happily from behind the mask of the
toughie from the gangs, the smuggler, the shill, the blackjack
dealer, and had said: ‘Take me by the hand. Open the door and
we will walk away together into the sunshine. Don’t worry. I
will keep step with you. I have always been in step with the
thought of you, but you didn’t come, and I have spent my life
listening to a different drummer.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Yes, he thought. It will be all right. That side of it. But was
he prepared for the consequences? Once he had taken her by
the hand it would be for ever. He would be in the role of the
healer, the analyst, to whom the patient had transferred her
love and trust on her way out of the illness. There would be no
cruelty equal to dropping her hand once he had taken it in his.
Was he ready for all that that meant in his life and his career?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stirred in his bunk and put the problem away. It was
too early for that. He was going too fast. Wait and see. One
thing at a time. And he obstinately shelved the issue and shifted
his thoughts to M and to the job which still had to be finished
before he could spend time worrying about his private life.</p>

<p class="pindent">Well, part of the snake had been smashed. Was it the head or
the tail? Difficult to say, but Bond was inclined to think that
Jack Spang and the mysterious ABC were the real operators of
the smuggling racket and that Seraffimo had only handled the
receiving end. Seraffimo could be replaced. Tiffany could be
discarded. Shady Tree, whom she could implicate in the diamond
smuggling, would have to be got under cover until the storm, if
Bond was indeed a storm signal, had blown over. But there was
nothing to implicate Jack Spang or the House of Diamonds and
the only clue to ABC was the London telephone number which
Bond reminded himself to extract from the girl as soon as possible.
That, and the machinery of contacts connected with it,
would be changed directly the full facts of Tiffany’s defection
and Bond’s escape had been communicated to London, presumably
by Shady Tree. So all this, reflected Bond, made Jack
Spang his next target and through him, ABC. Then there only
remained the beginning of the pipeline in Africa, and that could
only be reached through ABC. Bond’s immediate concern, he
concluded before letting sleep take him, was to report the whole
situation to M as soon as possible after boarding the <span class="it">Queen
Elizabeth</span>, and let London take over. Vallance’s men would get
working. There wouldn’t be much for Bond to do even when
he got back. A lot of reports to write. The same old routine at
the office. And in the evenings there would be Tiffany in the
spare room of his flat off the Kings Road. He would have to send
a cable to May to get things fixed. Let’s see—flowers, bath
essence from Floris, air the sheets. . . .</p>

<p class="pindent">Just ten hours after leaving Los Angeles they roared over La
Guardia and turned out at sea for the long run in.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was eight o’clock on Sunday morning and there were few
people about at the airport, but an official stopped them as they
were walking in off the tarmac and led them to a side entrance
where there were two young men waiting, one from Pinkertons
and one from the State Department. While they chatted about
the flights, their luggage was brought round and they were taken
to a side door and out to where a smart maroon Pontiac was
waiting, its engine purring and the blinds in the rear pulled
down.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then there were some empty hours in the apartment belonging
to the Pinkerton man until, at around four in the afternoon,
but with a quarter of an hour between them, they were
climbing up the covered gangway into the great safe, black
British belly of the <span class="it">Queen Elizabeth</span> and were at last in their
cabins on M deck with their doors locked against the world.</p>

<p class="pindent">But, as first Tiffany Case and then James Bond went into the
mouth of the gangway, a deckhand from Anastasia’s Longshoreman’s
Union had walked swiftly to a phone booth in the customs
shed.</p>

<p class="pindent">And three hours later two American businessmen were
dropped at the dockside by a black sedan and were just in time
to get through Immigration and Customs and up the gangway
before the loudspeakers began calling for all visitors to leave the
ship please.</p>

<p class="pindent">And one of the businessmen was youngish, with a pretty face
and a glimpse of prematurely white hair under the Stetson with
the waterproof cover, and the name on the brief-case he was
carrying was B. Kitteridge.</p>

<p class="pindent">And the other was a big, fattish man with a nervous glare in
the small eyes behind the bi-focals, and he was sweating profusely
and constantly wiping his face round with a big handkerchief.</p>

<p class="pindent">And the name on the label of his grip was W. Winter, and
below the name, in red ink, was written: <span class="calibre3">MY BLOOD GROUP IS F</span>.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_22">22<br class="lgl"/> <span class="gesp">LOVE AND SAUCE BÉARNAISE</span></h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">P</span>UNCTUALLY at eight, the great reverberating efflatus of the
<span class="it">Queen Elizabeth</span>’s siren made the glass tremble in the skyscrapers
and the tugs fussed the big ship out into midstream and
nosed her round and, at a cautious five knots, she moved slowly
down-river on the slack tide.</p>

<p class="pindent">There would be a pause to drop the pilot at the Ambrose
Light and then the quadruple screws would whip the sea into
cream and the <span class="it">Elizabeth</span> would give a shudder of release and
lance off on the long flat arc up from the 45th to the 50th parallel
and the dot on it that was Southampton.</p>

<p class="pindent">Sitting in his cabin, listening to the quiet creak of the woodwork
and watching his pencil on the dressing-table roll slowly
between his hair brush and the edge of his passport, Bond remembered
the days when her course had been different, when
she had zig-zagged deep into the South Atlantic as she played
her game of hide-and-seek with the U-boat wolfpacks, <span class="it">en route</span>
for the flames of Europe. It was still an adventure, but now the
<span class="it">Queen</span>, in her cocoon of protective radio impulses—her radar,
her Loran, her echo-sounder—moved with the precautions of an
oriental potentate among his bodyguards and outriders, and, so
far as Bond was concerned, boredom and indigestion would be
the only hazards of the voyage.</p>

<p class="pindent">He picked up the telephone and asked for Miss Case. When
she heard his voice she gave a theatrical groan. “The sailor hates
the sea,” she said. “I’m feeling sick already and we’re still in
the river.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Just as well,” said Bond. “Stay in your cabin and live on
dramamine and champagne. I’ll be no good for two or three
days. I’m going to get the doctor and the masseur from the
Turkish bath and try and stick the bits together again. And
anyway it won’t do any harm to stay out of sight for most of the
voyage. It’s just conceivable they picked us up in New York.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, if you promise to call me up every day,” said Tiffany,
“and promise to take me to this Veranda Grill place as soon as I
feel I can swallow a little caviar. Okay?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. “If you absolutely insist,” he said. “And now
listen, in exchange, I want you to try and remember anything
you can about ABC and the London end of this business. That
telephone number. And anything else. I’ll tell you what it’s all
about and why I’m interested as soon as I can, but in the meantime
you’ve just got to trust me. Is it a deal?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, sure,” said the girl indifferently, as if all that side of
her life had lost its importance; and for ten minutes Bond questioned
her minutely, but except for small details, fruitlessly,
about the ABC routine.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he put down the receiver and rang for the steward and
ordered some dinner and sat down to write the long report
which he would have to transpose into code and send off that
night.</p>

<p class="pindent">The ‘Metal Mike’ took the ship quietly on into the darkness
and the small township of three thousand five hundred souls
settled down to the five days of its life in which there would be
all the happenings natural to any other sizeable community—burglaries,
fights, seductions, drunkenness, cheating; perhaps a
birth or two, the chance of a suicide and, in a hundred crossings,
perhaps even a murder.</p>

<p class="pindent">As the iron town loped easily along the broad Atlantic swell
and the soft night wind thrummed and moaned in the masthead,
the radio aerials were already transmitting the morse of
the duty operator to the listening ear of Portishead.</p>

<p class="pindent">And what the duty operator was sending at exactly ten pm
Eastern Standard Time, was a cable addressed: <span class="calibre3">ABC, CARE HOUSE
OF DIAMONDS, HATTON GARDEN, LONDON</span>, which said: <span class="calibre3">PARTIES
LOCATED STOP IF MATTER REQUIRES DRASTIC SOLUTION ESSENTIAL YOU
STATE PRICE PAYABLE IN DOLLARS</span>. The signature was <span class="calibre3">WINTER</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">An hour later, while the <span class="it">Queen Elizabeth</span>’s operator was sighing
at the thought of having to transmit five hundred five-letter
groups addressed: <span class="calibre3">THE MANAGING DIRECTOR, UNIVERSAL EXPORT,
REGENTS PARK, LONDON</span>, Portishead radio was sending a short
cable addressed: <span class="calibre3">WINTER FIRST CLASS PASSENGER QUEEN ELIZABETH</span>,
which said: <span class="calibre3">DESIRE TIDY SPEEDY CONCLUSION OF CASE REPEAT CASE
STOP WILL PAY TWENTY GRAND STOP WILL PERSONALLY HANDLE OTHER
SUBJECT ON ARRIVAL LONDON CONFIRM ABC</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">And the operator looked up Winter in the passenger list and
put the message in an envelope and sent it down to a cabin on
A deck, the deck below Bond and the girl, where two men were
playing gin-rummy in their shirt-sleeves, and as the steward left
the cabin he heard the fat man say cryptically to the man with
white hair, “Whaddya know, Booful! It’s twenty Grand for a
rub these days, Boy-oh-boy!”</p>

<p class="pindent">It was not until the third day out that Bond and Tiffany made
a date to meet for cocktails in the Observation Lounge and later
to have dinner in the Veranda Grill. At midday the weather was
dead calm, and after lunch in his cabin Bond had got a peremptory
message in a round girlish hand on a sheet of the ship’s
writing paper. It said, ‘Fix a rendez-me today. Fail not,’ and
Bond’s hand had gone at once to the telephone.</p>

<p class="pindent">They were thirsty for each other’s company after the three
days’ separation, but Tiffany’s defences were up when she joined
him at the obscure corner table he had chosen in the gleaming
semi-circular cocktail bar in the bows.</p>

<p class="pindent">“What kind of a table’s this?” she inquired sarcastically. “You
ashamed of me or something? Here I put on the best those Hollywood
pansies can dream up and you hide me away like I was
Miss Rheingold 1914. I want to have myself some fun on this old
paddleboat and you put me in a corner as if I was catching.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s about it,” said Bond. “All you want to do is put the
other men’s temperatures up.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What d’you expect a girl to do on the <span class="it">Queen Elizabeth</span>?
Fish?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. He signalled to the waiter and ordered Vodka
dry Martinis with lemon peel. “I could give you one alternative.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Dear Diary,” said the girl, “having wonderful time with
handsome Englishman. Trouble is, he’s after my family jewels.
What do I do? Yours truly, puzzled.” Then suddenly she leant
over and put her hand on his. “Listen, you Bond person,” she
said. “I’m as happy as a cricket. I love being here. I love being
with you. And I love this nice dark table where no one can see
me holding your hand. Don’t mind my talk. I just can’t get
over being so happy. Don’t mind my silly jokes, will you?”</p>

<p class="pindent">She was wearing a heavy cream Shantung silk shirt and a
charcoal skirt in a cotton-and-wool mixture. The neutral colours
showed off her <span class="it">café-au-lait</span> sunburn. The small square Cartier
watch with the black strap was her only jewellery and the short
fingernails on the small brown hand that lay over his were unpainted.
The reflected sunlight from outside shone on the pale
gold heavy falling swerve of her hair, in the depths of the chatoyant
grey eyes, and on the glint of white teeth between the
luxurious lips that were half open with her question.</p>

<p class="pindent">“No,” said Bond. “No, I won’t mind, Tiffany. Everything
about you’s fine.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked into his eyes and was satisfied. The drinks came
and she withdrew her hand and observed him quizzically over
the rim of her glass.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Now tell me a few things,” she said. “First of all, what do
you do and who are you working for? At the beginning, in the
hotel, I thought you were a crook. But somehow as soon as you
had gone out the door I knew you weren’t. Guess I should have
warned ABC and we’d have avoided a lot of fuss. But I just
didn’t. Come on, James. Start giving.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I work for the Government,” said Bond. “They want to stop
this diamond smuggling.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sort of secret agent?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Just a Civil Servant.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Okay. So what are you going to do with me when we get to
London? Lock me up?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes. In the spare room of my flat.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s better. Shall I become a subject of the Queen like
you? I’d rather like to be a subject person.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I expect we could fix that.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Are you married?” She paused. “Or anything?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No. I occasionally have affairs.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“So you’re one of those old-fashioned men who like sleeping
with women. Why haven’t you ever married?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I expect because I think I can handle life better on my own.
Most marriages don’t add two people together. They subtract
one from the other.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiffany Case thought this over. “Maybe there’s something in
that,” she said finally. “But it depends what you want to add
up to. Something human or something inhuman. You can’t be
complete by yourself.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What about you?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl hadn’t wanted the question. “Maybe I just settled
for the inhuman,” she said shortly. “And who in hell do you
think I should have married? Shady Tree?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“There must have been lots of others.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, there weren’t,” she said angrily. “Maybe you think I
shouldn’t have mixed with these people. Well, I guess I just
got off on the wrong step.” The flare of anger died and she
looked at him defensively. “It does happen to people, James. It
really does. And sometimes it’s really not their fault.”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond put out his hand and held hers tightly. “I know,
Tiffany,” he said. “Felix told me a bit about things. That’s why
I haven’t asked any questions. Just don’t think about it. It’s here
and today now. Not yesterday.” He changed the subject. “Now
you give me some facts. For instance, why are you called Tiffany
and what’s it like being a dealer at the Tiara? How the hell did
you come to be so good? It was brilliant the way you handled
those cards. If you can do that you can do anything.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thanks, pal,” said the girl ironically. “Like what? Playing
the boats? And the reason I got called Tiffany is because when
I was born, dear father Case was so sore I wasn’t a boy he gave
my mother a thousand bucks and a powder case from Tiffany’s
and walked out. Joined the Marines. In the end he got killed at
Iwo Jima. So my mother just called me Tiffany Case and set
about earning a living for us both. Started with a string of callgirls
and then got more ambitious. Maybe that doesn’t sound so
good to you?” She looked at him half defensively and half
pleadingly.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Doesn’t worry me,” said Bond dryly. “You weren’t one of
the girls.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She shrugged her shoulders. “Then the place got busted by
the gangs.” She paused and drank the rest of her Martini. “And
I lit out on my own. The usual jobs a girl takes. Then I found
my way to Reno. They’ve got a School of Dealing there and I
signed on and worked like hell at it. Took the full course.
Majored in craps, roulette and blackjack. You can earn good
money dealing. Two hundred a week. The men like to have girls
dealing, and it gives the women confidence. They think you’ll be
kind to them. Sisters under the skin kind of. The men dealers
frighten them. But don’t get the idea it’s fun. It reads better than
it lives.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She paused and smiled up at him. “Now it’s your turn again,”
she said. “Buy me another drink and then tell me what sort
of a woman you think would add to you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gave his order to the steward. He lit a cigarette and
turned back to her. “Somebody who can make Sauce Béarnaise
as well as love,” he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Holy mackerel! Just any old dumb hag who can cook and lie
on her back?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, no. She’s got to have all the usual things that all women
have.” Bond examined her. “Gold hair. Grey eyes. A sinful
mouth. Perfect figure. And of course she’s got to make lots of
funny jokes and know how to dress and play cards and so forth.
The usual things.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“And you’d marry this person if you found her?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Not necessarily,” said Bond. “Matter of fact I’m almost
married already. To a man. Name begins with M. I’d have to
divorce him before I tried marrying a woman. And I’m not sure
I’d want that. She’d get me handing round canapés in an L-shaped
drawing-room. And there’d be all those ghastly ‘Yes,
you did—no I didn’t’ rows that seem to go with marriage. It
wouldn’t last. I’d get claustrophobia and run out on her. Get
myself sent to Japan or somewhere.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What about children?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Like to have some,” said Bond shortly. “But only when I
retire. Not fair on the children otherwise. My job’s not all that
secure.” He looked into his drink and swallowed it down. “And
what about you, Tiffany?” he said to change the subject.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I guess every girl would like to come home and find a hat
on the hall table,” said Tiffany moodily. “Trouble is I’ve never
found the right sort of thing growing under the hat. Maybe I
haven’t looked hard enough or in the right places. You know
how it is when you get in a groove. You get so that you’re quite
glad not to look over the edges. In that way I’ve had it good
with the Spangs. Always knew where the next meal was coming
from. Put some money by. But a girl can’t have friends in that
company. You either put up a notice saying ‘No Entry’ or you’re
apt to pick up a bad case of round heels. But I guess I’m fed up
with being on my own. You know what the chorines say on
Broadway? ‘It’s a lonesome wash without a man’s shirt in it’.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. “Well, you’re out of the groove now,” he said.
He looked at her quizzically. “But what about Mister Seraffimo?
Those two bedrooms on the Pullman and the champagne supper
laid for two. . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">Before he could finish, her eyes blazed briefly and she stood
up from the table and walked straight out of the bar.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond cursed himself. He put some money down on the bill
and hurried after her. He caught up with her half way down
the Promenade Deck. “Now listen, Tiffany,” he began.</p>

<p class="pindent">She turned brusquely round and faced him. “How mean can
you be?” she said and angry tears glistened on her eyelashes.
“Why do you have to spoil everything with an abrasive remark
like that? Oh, James,” forlornly she turned to the windows,
searching for a handkerchief in her bag. She dabbed her eyes.
“You just don’t understand.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond put an arm round her and held her to him. “My
darling.” He knew that nothing but the great step of physical
love would cure these misunderstandings, but that words and
time still had to be wasted. “I didn’t mean to hurt you. I just
wanted to know for certain. That was a bad night on the train
and that supper-table hurt me much more than what happened
later. I had to ask you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked up at him doubtfully. “You mean that?” she said
searching his face. “You mean you liked me already?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’t be a goose,” said Bond impatiently. “Don’t you know
anything about anything?”</p>

<p class="pindent">She turned away from him and looked out of the window
at the endless blue sea and at the handful of dipping gulls that
were keeping company with their wonderfully prodigal ship.
After a while she said: “You ever read <span class="it">Alice in Wonderland</span>?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Years ago,” said Bond, surprised. “Why?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“There’s a line there I often think of,” she said. “It says, ‘Oh,
Mouse, do you know the way out of this pool of tears? I am
very tired of swimming about here, oh Mouse.’ Remember?
Well, I thought you were going to tell me the way out. Instead
of that you ducked me in the pool. That’s why I got upset.” She
glanced up at him. “But I guess you didn’t mean to hurt.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked quietly at her mouth and then kissed her hard
on the lips.</p>

<p class="pindent">She didn’t respond, but broke away, and her eyes were laughing
again. She linked her arm high up in his and turned towards
the open doors that led to the lift. “Take me down,” she said. “I
must go and rewrite my face, and anyway I want to spend a long
time dressing the business for sale.” She paused and then put her
mouth close up to his ear. “In case it interests you, James Bond,”
she said softly. “I’ve never what you’d call ‘slept with a man’ in
my life.” She tugged at his arm. “And now come on,” she said
brusquely. “And anyway it’s time you went and had a Hot
Domestic. I suppose that’s part of the subject-language you’ll be
wanting me to pick up. You subject-people surely do write up
the craziest things in your bathrooms.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took her to her cabin and then went on to his and had
a ‘Hot Salt’ bath followed by a ‘Cold Domestic’ shower. Then
he lay on his bed and smiled to himself over some of the things
she had said, and thought of her lying in her bath looking at the
forest of bath-taps and thinking how crazy the English were.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a knock on the door and his steward came in with
a small tray which he placed on the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">“What the hell’s that?” said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Just come up from the chef, Sir,” said the Steward and went
out and closed the cabin door.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond slipped off the bed and went over and examined the
contents of the tray. He smiled to himself. There was a quarter
bottle of Bollinger, a chafing dish containing four small slivers of
steak on toast canapés, and a small bowl of sauce. Beside this was
a pencilled note which said ‘This Sauce Béarnaise has been
created by Miss T. Case without my assistance,’ Signed ‘The
Chef’.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond filled a glass with champagne and spread a lot of the
Béarnaise on a piece of the steak and munched it carefully.
Then he went to the telephone.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Tiffany?”</p>

<p class="pindent">He heard the low delighted laugh at the other end.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, you can certainly make wonderful Sauce Béarnaise. . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">He put the receiver back on its cradle.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_23">23<br class="lgl"/> <span class="gesp">THE JOB COMES SECOND</span></h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span>T is an intoxicating moment in a love-affair when, for the first
time, in a public place, in a restaurant or a theatre, the man
puts his hand down and lays it on the thigh of the girl and
when she slips her hand over his and presses the man’s hand
against her. The two gestures say everything that can be said.
All is agreed. All the pacts are signed. And there is a long minute
of silence during which the blood sings.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was eleven o’clock and there was only a scattering of people
left in the corners of the Veranda Grill. There was a soft sighing
from the moonlit sea outside as the great liner scythed the black
meadow of the Atlantic and, in the stern, only the slightest lope
in her stride indicated a long soft swell, the slow, twelve-a-minute
heart-beat of a sleeping ocean, to the two people sitting
close together behind the pink-shaded light.</p>

<p class="pindent">The waiter came with the bill and their hands separated. But
now there was all the time in the world and no need for reassurance
from words or contact, and the girl laughed happily
up into Bond’s face as the waiter drew out the table and they
walked towards the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">They got into the lift for the Promenade Deck. “And now
what, James?” said Tiffany. “I’d like some more coffee, and a
Stinger made with white <span class="it">crème de menthe</span>, while we listen to
the Auction Pool. I’ve heard so much about it and we might
make a fortune.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“All right,” said Bond. “Anything you say.” He held her
arm close to him as they sauntered through the big lounge where
Bingo was still being played and through the waiting ballroom
where the musicians were trying out a few chords. “But don’t
make me buy a number. It’s a pure gamble and five per cent goes
to charity. Nearly as bad as Las Vegas odds. But it’s fun if there’s
a good auctioneer, and they tell me there’s plenty of money on
board this trip.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The Smoking Room was almost empty and they chose a small
table away from the platform where the Chief Steward was
laying out the auctioneer’s paraphernalia, the box for the numbered
slips, the hammer, the carafe of water.</p>

<p class="pindent">“In the theatre this is what’s known as ‘dressing a thin
house’,” said Tiffany as they sat down amidst the forest of
empty chairs and tables. But, as Bond gave his order to the
steward, the doors leading to the cinema opened and soon there
were nearly a hundred people in the Smoking Room.</p>

<p class="pindent">The auctioneer, a paunchy, jovial Midlands businessman with
a red carnation in the buttonhole of his dinner jacket, rapped on
his table for silence and announced that the Captain’s estimate
of the next day’s run lay between 720 and 739 miles, that any
distance shorter than 720 was the Low Field and anything longer
than 739 the High Field. “And now, ladies and gentlemen, let’s
see if we can’t break the record for this trip which stands at the
impressive figure of £2400 in the Pool” (Applause).</p>

<p class="pindent">A steward offered the box of folded numbers to the richest-looking
woman in the room and then handed up the piece of
paper she had drawn to the auctioneer.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, ladies and gentlemen, here we have an exceptionally
good number to start with. 738. Right in the top range and since
I see a lot of new faces here tonight (laughter) I think we can
all agree that the sea is exceptionally calm. Ladies and gentlemen.
What am I bid for 738? May I say £50? Will anybody bid
me £50 for this lucky number? 20 was it you said, Sir? Well,
we’ve got to start somewhere. Any increase . . . 25. Thank you,
madam. And 30. 40 over there, steward. And 45 from my friend
Mr Rothblatt. Thank you, Charlie. Any increase on £45 for
No738? 50. Thank you, madam, and now we’re all back where
we started. (Laughter.) Any increase on £50? Nobody tempted?
High number. Calm sea. £50. Will anybody say 55? Going at
£50. Going once. Going twice.” And the raised hammer fell
with a bang.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, thank heavens he’s a good auctioneer,” said Bond.
“That was a good number and cheap if this weather goes on and
nobody falls overboard. The High Field’ll cost a packet this
evening. Everyone will expect us to do more than 739 miles in
this weather.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What do you mean by a packet?” asked Tiffany.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Two hundred pounds. Perhaps more. I expect the ordinary
numbers will sell for around a hundred. The first number’s
always cheaper than the others. People haven’t warmed up. The
only smart thing you can do at this game is buy the first number.
Any of them can win, but the first costs less.”</p>

<p class="pindent">As Bond finished speaking, the next number was knocked
down for £90 to a pretty, excited girl who was obviously being
staked by her companion, a grey-haired, fresh-complexioned man
who looked a caricature of an <span class="it">Esquire</span> sugar-daddy.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Go on. Buy me a number, James,” said Tiffany. “You really
don’t treat a girl right. Look at the way that nice man treats his
girl.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“He’s past the age of consent,” said Bond. “He must be sixty.
Up to forty, girls cost nothing. After that you have to pay money,
or tell a story. Of the two it’s the story that hurts most.” He
smiled into her eyes. “Anyway I’m not forty yet.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’t be conceited,” said the girl. She looked at his mouth.
“They say that older men make much the best lovers. And yet
you’re not naturally a tightwad. I bet it’s because gambling’s
illegal in subject-ships or something.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It’s all right outside the 3-mile limit,” said Bond. “But even
so the Cunard have been dam careful not to involve the Company
in it. Listen to this.” He picked up an orange card that lay
on their table. “Auction Sweepstake on Ship’s Daily Run,” he
read. “In view of inquiries it is considered desirable to re-state
the Company’s position in connection with the above. It is not
the Company’s wish that the Smoke Room Steward or other
members of the ship’s personnel should play an active part in
organizing sweepstakes on the daily run.” Bond looked up. “You
see,” he said. “Playing it pretty close to the chest. And then they
go on: ‘The Company suggests that the passengers should elect
a Committee from amongst themselves to formulate and control
the details . . . the Smoke Room Steward may, if requested and
if his duties permit, render such assistance as the Committee
require for auctioning of numbers.’ ”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Pretty cagey,” commented Bond. “It’s the committee that
holds the baby if there’s any trouble. And listen to this. This is
where the trouble comes in.” He read on: “The Company draws
special attention to the provisions of the United Kingdom
Finance Regulations as affecting the negotiability of sterling
cheques and the limitation on the importation of sterling banknotes
into the United Kingdom.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond put down the card. “And so forth,” he said. He smiled
at Tiffany Case. “So I buy you the number that’s just being
auctioned and you win two thousand pounds. That’ll be a pile
of dollars and pound notes and cheques. The only way of spending
all that sterling, even suppose that those cheques are all
good, which is doubtful, would be by smuggling it through
under your suspender belt. And there we’d be, back in the same
old racket, but now with me on the side of the devil.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl was not impressed. “There used to be a guy in the
gangs called Abadaba,” she said. “He was a crooked egg-head
who knew all the answers. Worked out the track odds, fixed the
percentage on the numbers racket, did all the brain work. They
called him ‘The Wizard of Odds’. Got rubbed out quite by mistake
in the Dutch Schultz killing,” she added parenthetically. “I
guess you’re just another Abadaba the way you talk yourself out
of having to spend some money on a girl. Oh, well,” she
shrugged her shoulders resignedly, “will you stake your girl to
another Stinger?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond beckoned to the steward. When he had gone she leant
over so that her hair brushed his ear and said softly. “I don’t
really want it. You have it. I want to stay sober as Sunday tonight.”
She sat up straight. “And now what’s going on around
here?” she said impatiently. “I want to see some action.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Here it comes,” said Bond. The auctioneer raised his voice
and there was a hush in the room. “And now, ladies and gentlemen,”
he said impressively. “We come to the 64,000-dollar question.
Who is going to bid me £100 for the choice of High or Low
Field? We all know what that means—the option to choose the
High Field, which I seem to feel may be the popular choice this
evening (laughter) in view of the wonderful weather outside. So
who will open the bidding with £100 for the choice of High or
Low Field?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thank you, Sir! And 110, 120 and 130. Thank you, madam.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Hundred and fifty,” said a man’s voice not far from their
table.</p>

<p class="pindent">“A hundred and sixty.” This time it was a woman.</p>

<p class="pindent">Monotonously the man’s voice called the 170.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Eighty,” said someone.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Two hundred pounds.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Something made Bond turn round and look at the man who
had spoken.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a biggish man. His face had the glistening, pasty appearance
of a spat-out bullseye. Small, cold dark eyes were looking
towards the auctioneer’s platform through motionless bi-focals.
All the man’s neck seemed to be at the back of his head.
Sweat matted the curly black algae of his hair and now he took
off his glasses and picked up a napkin and wiped the sweat off
with a circular motion that started with the left side of the face
and swirled round to the back of his head where his right hand
took over and completed the circuit as far as the dripping nose.
“Two hundred and ten,” said someone. The big man’s chin
wobbled and he opened his tight-buttoned mouth and said,
“Two hundred and twenty” in a level American voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">What was there about this man that struck a chord in Bond’s
memory? He watched the big face, running his mind’s eye over
the filing system of his brain, pulling out drawer after drawer,
hunting for the clue. The face? The voice? England? America?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gave up and turned his attention to the other man at the
table. Again, the same urgent sense of recognition. The curiously
delicate young features under the slicked-back white hair. The
soft brown eyes under the long lashes. The general effect of
prettiness, spoiled by the fleshy nose over the wide thin mouth,
now open in a square empty smile like the grin of a letter-box.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Two hundred and fifty,” said the big man mechanically.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned to Tiffany. “Ever see those two before?” he said
and she noticed the line of worry between his eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Nope,” she said definitely. “Never did. Look like something
from Brooklyn to me. Or a couple of cloak-and-suiters from the
Garment District. Why? Do they mean anything to you?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gave them another glance. “No,” he said doubtfully.
“No, I don’t think so.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a burst of clapping in the room and the auctioneer
beamed and rapped on the table. “Ladies and gentlemen,” he
said triumphantly. “This is really splendid. Three hundred
pounds I am bid by the charming lady in the beautiful pink
evening dress. (Heads turned and craned and Bond could see
the mouths saying ‘who is she?’) And now, Sir,” he turned towards
the fat man’s table, “May I say £325?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Three hundred and fifty,” said the fat man.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Four hundred,” squealed the pink woman.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Five hundred.” The voice was toneless, indifferent.</p>

<p class="pindent">The pink girl chattered angrily at her escort. The man suddenly
looked bored. He caught the auctioneer’s eye and shook
his head.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Any increase on £500?” said the auctioneer. He now knew
that he had squeezed all he would get out of the room. “Going
once. Going twice.” Bang! “Sold to the gentleman over there,
and I really think he deserves a clap.” He clapped his hands and
the crowd dutifully followed suit although they would have preferred
the pink girl to win.</p>

<p class="pindent">The fat man lifted himself a few inches off his chair and then
sat down again. There was no acknowledgment of the applause
in his glistening face and he kept his eyes fixed on the auctioneer.</p>

<p class="pindent">“And now we must go through the formality of asking this
gentleman which Field he prefers. (Laughter.) Sir, do you choose
the High Field or the Low Field?” The auctioneer’s voice was
ironical. The question was a waste of time.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Low Field.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a moment of dead silence in the crowded Smoking
Room. It was quickly followed by a buzz of comment. There
had been no question. It was obvious that the man would take
the High Field. The weather was perfect. The <span class="it">Queen</span> must be
doing at least thirty knots. Did he know something? Had he
bribed someone on the bridge? Was a storm coming up? Was a
bearing running hot?</p>

<p class="pindent">The auctioneer rapped for silence. “I beg your pardon, Sir,”
he said, “but did you say the Low Field?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The auctioneer rapped again. “In that case, ladies and gentlemen,
we will now proceed to auction the High Field. Madam,”
he turned with a bow towards the girl in pink. “Would you
care to open the bidding?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned to Tiffany. “That was a queer business,” he said.
“Extraordinary thing to do. Sea’s as calm as glass.” He shrugged
his shoulders. “The only answer is that they know something.”
The matter was of no interest, anyway. “Someone’s told them
something.” He turned and looked carelessly at the two men
and then let his eyes swing past and away from them. “They
seem to be quite interested in us.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiffany glanced past his shoulder. “They’re not looking at us
now,” she said. “I figure they’re just a couple of dopes. The
white-haired guy’s looking stupid and the fat man’s sucking his
thumb. They’re screwy. Doubt if they know what they’ve
bought. They just got their signals crossed.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sucking his thumb?” said Bond. He ran his hand distractedly
through his hair, a vague memory nagging at him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Perhaps if she had left him to follow the train of thought he
would have remembered. Instead she put her hand over his and
leant towards him so that her hair brushed against his face.
“Forget it, James,” she said. “And don’t think so hard about
those stupid men.” Her eyes were suddenly ardent and demanding.
“I’ve had enough of this place. Take me somewhere else.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Without saying anything more, they got up and left the table
and walked out of the noisy room to the staircase. As they went
down the stairs to the deck below, Bond’s arm went round the
girl’s waist and her head fell against his shoulder.</p>

<p class="pindent">They came to the door of Tiffany’s cabin, but she pulled him
away and on down the long, softly creaking corridor.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I want it to be in your house, James,” she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said nothing until he had kicked the door of his cabin
shut behind them and they had twisted round and stood locked
together in the middle of the wonderfully private, wonderfully
anonymous little room. And then he just said, softly, “My
darling,” and put one hand in her hair so that he could hold
her mouth where he wanted it.</p>

<p class="pindent">And after a while his other hand went to the zip fastener at
the back of her dress and without moving away from him she
stepped out of her dress and panted between their kisses. “I want
it all, James. Everything you’ve ever done to a girl. Now.
Quickly.”</p>

<p class="pindent">And Bond bent down and put an arm round her thighs and
picked her up and laid her gently on the floor.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_24">24<br class="lgl"/> <span class="gesp">DEATH IS SO PERMANENT</span></h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE last thing Bond remembered before the telephone rang
was Tiffany bending over him in bed and kissing him and
saying, “You shouldn’t sleep on the heart-side, my treasure. It’s
bad for the heart. It might stop beating. Turn over.” And
obediently he had turned and as the door clicked he was at once
asleep again with her voice and the sigh of the Atlantic and the
soft roll of the ship holding him in their arms.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then the angry bell rang in the dark cabin and went on
ringing and Bond cursed and reached for it and a voice said,
“Sorry to disturb you, Sir. This is the wireless operator. There’s
a cipher signal just come in for you and it’s got an <span class="it">en clair</span> prefix
of ‘Most Immediate’. Shall I call it out to you or send it
down?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Send it down, would you?” said Bond. “And thanks.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Now what the hell? All the beauty and heat and excitement
of passionate love were pushed roughly away as he turned on the
lights, slipped out of bed and, shaking his head to clear it, took
the two steps into the shower.</p>

<p class="pindent">For a full minute he let the water hit him, and then he rubbed
himself down and picked up his trousers and shirt from the
floor and climbed into them.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a knock on the door and he took the cable and
sat down at the desk and lit a cigarette and set grimly to work.
And, as the groups gradually dissolved into words, his eyes grew
narrower and the skin slowly crawled on his body.</p>

<p class="pindent">The cable was from the Chief of Staff. It said:</p>

</div>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat for a moment frozen to his chair. Suddenly, there
flashed unwanted into his mind that most sinister line in all
poetry: ‘They reckon ill who leave me out. When me they fly,
I am the wings.’</p>

<p class="pindent">So somebody from the Spangled Mob was on board and
travelling with them. Who? Where?</p>

<p class="pindent">His hand snatched at the telephone.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Miss Case, please.”</p>

<p class="pindent">He could hear the telephone beside her bed click and then
give its first ring. The second. The third. Just one more. He
crashed the receiver back on to its cradle and ran out of his room
and up the corridor to her cabin. Nothing. Empty. The bed
unslept in. The lights burning. But her evening bag lay on the
carpet by the door and its contents were scattered around it. She
had come in. The man had been behind the door. Perhaps a
cosh had fallen. And then what?</p>

<p class="pindent">The portholes were closed. He looked into the bathroom.
Nothing.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stood in the middle of the cabin and his mind was as
cold as ice. What would he, Bond, have done? Before he killed
her he would have questioned her. Found out what she knew,
what she had told, who this man Bond was. Got her to his cabin
where he could work on her undisturbed. If somebody met him
carrying her there, it would only have needed a wink and a
shake of the head. “Bit too much champagne tonight. No
thanks, I can manage.” But which cabin? How long had he got?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked at his watch as he ran back down the silent corridor.
Three o’clock. She must have left him some time after
two. Should he call the bridge? Give the alarm? A ghastly vista
of explanation, suspicions, delays. “My dear Sir. That hardly
seems possible.” Attempts to calm him. “Of course, Sir, we’ll do
our best.” The polite eyes of the Sergeant-at-Arms who would
be thinking in terms of drunkenness and crossing in love—even
of someone trying to delay the ship so as to win the Low Field
in the Ship’s Auction.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Low Field! Man overboard! The ship delayed!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond slammed the door of his cabin and dived for the Passenger
List. Of course. Winter. Here he was. A49. The deck
below. And then suddenly Bond’s mind clicked like a comptometer.
Winter. Wint and Kidd. The two torpedoes. The men
in the hoods. Back to the passenger list. Kitteridge. In A49 too.
The white-haired man and the fat man in the BOAC plane from
London. ‘My blood group is F’. The secret escort for Tiffany.
And Leiter’s description. “He’s called ‘Windy’ because he hates
travelling.” “One day that wart on his thumb will catch him
out.” The red wart on the first joint holding back the hammer
of the gun over Tingaling Bell. And Tiffany saying, “They’re
screwy. The fat man’s sucking his thumb!” And the two men
in the Smoking Room cashing in on the death that had been
arranged. The woman overboard. The alarm given anonymously
in case the stern watch missed her. The ship stopped, turning,
searching. And three thousand pounds extra to the killers.</p>

<p class="pindent">Wint and Kidd. The torpedoes from Detroit.</p>

<p class="pindent">The whole reel of jumbled pictures whirred through Bond’s
mind in a flash of revelation and even while he was scanning
them he was opening his small attaché case and extracting the
squat silencer from its hidden pocket. Automatically, as he took
the Beretta from amongst his shirts at the back of a drawer,
checked the magazine and screwed the silencer into the muzzle,
he was weighing the odds and planning his moves.</p>

<p class="pindent">He hunted for the ship’s plan that had come with his ticket.
Spread it out while he pulled on his socks. A49. Directly below
him. Was there any chance of shooting the lock off the door and
getting both of them before they got him? Practically none. And
they would have bolted the door as well as locked it. Or take
some of the staff with him, if he could persuade them of the
danger to Tiffany? During the palaver and ‘Excuse me, Sirs’
they would get her out of the porthole and be innocently reading
books or playing cards and ‘What’s all the fuss about?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shoved the gun into his waistband and wrenched one of
his two portholes wide open. He thrust his shoulders through,
relieved to find that there was at least an inch to spare. He
craned down. Two dimly lit circles directly below him. How
far? About eight feet. The night was still dead calm. No wind,
and he was on the dark side of the ship. Would he be spotted
from the flying bridge? Would one of their portholes be open?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond dropped back into his cabin and tore the sheets off his
bed. The Blood Knot. That would be safest. But he would have
to rip the sheets in half to get enough length. If he won, he
would have to get some sheets from A49 and leave their steward
to puzzle out the loss. If he lost, nothing would matter.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond put all his strength on the rope. Should hold. As he tied
one end round the hinge of the porthole he glanced at his watch.
Only twelve minutes had been wasted since he had read the
cable. Had it been too long? He set his teeth and threw the rope
out down the side of the ship and climbed out head foremost.</p>

<p class="pindent">Don’t think. Don’t look down. Don’t look up. Never mind
the knots. Slowly, firmly, hand over hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">The night wind tugged softly at him and swayed him against
the black iron rivets, and from far down below sounded the deep
boom and woosh of the sea. From somewhere above came the
ropey twang of the wind of their speed in the rigging and, far
above that, the stars would be swinging slowly round the twin
masts.</p>

<p class="pindent">Would the blasted, the beloved, sheets hold? Would vertigo
get him? Could his arms stand the weight? Don’t think about
it. Don’t think of the huge ship, the hungry sea, the great quadruple
screws waiting to slice into his body. You are a boy climbing
down an apple tree. It’s so easy and so safe there in the
orchard with the grass to fall on.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shut his mind and watched his hands and felt the roughness
of the paint against his knuckles, and his feet were as sensitive
as antennæ as they groped below him for the first contact
with the porthole.</p>

<p class="pindent">There. The toes of his right foot had touched the protruding
rim. He must stop. He MUST be patient and let his foot explore
further—the wide-open porthole, held by its big brass latch; the
feel of cloth against his sock: the curtains closed. Now he could
go on. It was nearly over.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then two more handholds and his face was level and he
could get a hand to the metal rim of the frame and take some
of the weight off the taut white rope and give one arm a blessed
rest, and then the other, shifting the burden from the cracking
muscles and gathering himself for the slow heave up and through
and then the final dive with one hand clutching for his gun.</p>

<p class="pindent">He listened, gazing at the circle of slowly swaying curtain,
trying to forget that he was clinging like a fly half way down
the side of the <span class="it">Queen Elizabeth</span>, trying not to listen to the sea
far below him, trying to still his own heavy breath and the
hammering of his heart.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a mumble inside the little room. A few words in
a masculine voice. And then a girl’s voice crying “No!”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a moment’s silence, and then a slap. It was as loud
as a pistol shot and it jerked Bond’s body up and through the
porthole as if he had been wrenched inwards by a rope.</p>

<p class="pindent">Even as he somehow dived cleanly through the three-foot circle
he was wondering what he would hit, and his left arm protected
his head as his right went to his gun.</p>

<p class="pindent">Crash on to a suitcase under the porthole, a ragged somersault
that took him half across the room, and he was on his feet and
backing, crouched low, towards the portholes, and the knuckles
were white with tension on his gun hand and there was a thin
white line round his clenched lips.</p>

<p class="pindent">Through the slitted lids the ice-grey eyes flickered from side
to side. The blunt, black gun stood at dead centre between the
two men.</p>

<p class="pindent">“All right,” said Bond, coming slowly to his full height.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a statement of fact. He had the control and the mouth
of his gun had said he should have it.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Who sent for you?” said the fat man. “You’re not in the act.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There were hidden reserves in the voice. No panic. Not even
enough surprise.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Come to make a fourth at gin?”</p>

<p class="pindent">He was sitting, in buttoned shirt-sleeves, sideways on to the
dressing-table, and the small eyes glittered in the moist face. In
front of him, with her back to Bond, Tiffany Case sat on an
upholstered stool. She was naked except for brief flesh-coloured
pants and her knees were gripped between the big man’s thighs.
Her face, with red marks across its paleness, was turned towards
Bond. Her eyes were wild, like a trapped animal’s, and her
mouth was open with disbelief.</p>

<p class="pindent">The white-haired man had been lying relaxed on one of the
beds. Now he was up on one elbow and his other hand was at
his shirt, half-way up to the gun in the black holster at his armpit.
He looked incuriously at Bond and his mouth was square
with the empty letter-box smile. From the middle of his smile
a wooden toothpick protruded from between closed teeth like
the tongue of a snake.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s gun held the neutral space between the two men.
When he spoke his voice was low and taut.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Tiffany,” he said slowly and distinctly. “Get down on your
knees. Edge away from that man. Keep your head down. Get
into the middle of the room.”</p>

<p class="pindent">He didn’t watch her, and his eyes continued to flicker between
the man on the chair and the man on the bed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now she was clear of the two targets.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m there, James.” The voice thrilled with hope and excitement.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Get up and walk straight into the bathroom. Shut the door.
Get into the bath and lie down.”</p>

<p class="pindent">His eyes slid towards her to see that he was being obeyed.
She had stood up and was facing him. His eyes registered the
red splay of a whole hand on the white skin of her body. Then
she had obeyed him and there was the click of the bathroom
door shutting.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now she was safe from the bullets. And she would not witness
what had to be done.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was five yards between the two men and Bond reflected
that if they could draw fast enough they had him bracketed.
With men like these, even in the split second of his killing one
of them, the other would have drawn and fired. While his own
gun was silent, its threat was infinite. But with his first bullet,
for a flash, the threat would be lifted from the other man.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Forty-eight sixty-five eighty-six.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The variation on the American football signal, one of fifty
other combinations which they must have practised together a
thousand times, spat out of the fat man’s mouth. Simultaneously
he hurled himself on the floor and his hand flashed to his waistband.</p>

<p class="pindent">In a swirl of motion the man on the bed swung his legs sideways
and away from Bond so that his body was now only a
narrow head-on target. The hand at his chest flickered up.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thud’.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s gun gave a single muffled grunt. A blue keyhole
opened just beneath the peak of the white hair.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Boom’ answered the dead man’s pistol, fired by the last twitch
of his finger, and the bullet buried itself into the bed beneath
his corpse.</p>

<p class="pindent">The fat man on the floor let out a scream. He was looking up
into the single empty black eye that didn’t care about him one
way or the other, but was only interested in which square centimetre
of his envelope it would open first.</p>

<p class="pindent">And the fat man’s gun had only achieved the elevation of
Bond’s knees and was pointing futilely between Bond’s braced
legs at the white-painted ironwork behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Drop it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a small noise as the gun fell to the carpet.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Get up.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The fat man scrambled to his feet and stood looking into
Bond’s eyes, as a tubercular looks into his handkerchief, with
fearful expectancy.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sit down.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Was there a flash of relief in the surrendered eyes? Bond
stayed tense as a stalking cat.</p>

<p class="pindent">The fat man turned slowly. He stretched his hands above his
head, although Bond had not told him to do so. He took the two
steps back to his chair and slowly turned round as if to sit down.</p>

<p class="pindent">He stood facing Bond and quite naturally he let his hands fall
down to his sides. And the two hands, relaxed, swung naturally
back, the right hand more than the left. And then suddenly, at
the top of the back-swing, the right arm tautened and flashed
forward and the throwing-knife bloomed from the tips of the
fingers like a white flame.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thud’.</p>

<p class="pindent">The quiet bullet and the quiet knife crossed in mid-air, and
the eyes of the two men flinched simultaneously as the weapons
struck.</p>

<p class="pindent">But the flinch in the eyes of the fat man turned into an upward
roll of the eyeballs as he fell backwards, clawing at his heart,
while Bond’s eyes only looked incuriously down at the spreading
stain on his shirt and at the flat handle of the knife hanging
loosely from its folds.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a crash as the chair splintered under the fat man,
and a rasping noise, and then a drumming on the floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked once and then turned away towards the open
porthole.</p>

<p class="pindent">For a while he stood with his back to the room, staring at the
softly swaying curtains. He gulped down the air and listened to
the beautiful sea-sounds from the world outside that still belonged
to him and to Tiffany, but not to the two others. Very
slowly his body and his strung nerves relaxed.</p>

<p class="pindent">After a time he pulled the knife out of his shirt. He didn’t
look at it, but reached up and drew the curtain aside and threw
the knife far out into the blackness. Then, still looking out into
the quiet night, he put up the safe of the Beretta and, with a
hand that suddenly seemed as heavy as lead, slowly thrust the
gun back into the waistband of his trousers.</p>

<p class="pindent">Almost reluctantly he turned back and faced the shambles of
the cabin. He looked it over thoughtfully and with an unconscious
gesture he wiped his hands down his flanks. Then he
carefully picked his way across the floor to the bathroom and
said, “It’s me, Tiffany,” in a tired, flat voice and opened the
door.</p>

<p class="pindent">She hadn’t heard his voice. She was lying face downwards in
the empty bath with her hands over her ears, and when he had
half-lifted her out and had taken her into his arms, she still
couldn’t believe it but clung to him and then slowly explored his
face and his chest with her hands to make sure it was true.</p>

<p class="pindent">He flinched as her hand touched his cut rib and she broke
away from him and looked at his face and then at the blood on
her fingers and then at his scarlet shirt.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, God. You’re hurt,” she said flatly, and her nightmares
were forgotten as she took off his shirt and washed the gashed
rib with soap and water and bound it with strips of towel cut
with one of the dead men’s razor blades.</p>

<p class="pindent">She still asked no questions when Bond collected her clothes
from the floor of the cabin and gave them to her and told her
not to come out until he was ready and to clean up everything
and wipe every object she had touched to kill the fingerprints.</p>

<p class="pindent">She just stood and looked at him with her eyes shining. And
when Bond kissed her on the lips she still said nothing.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gave her a reassuring smile and walked out and shut
the door of the bathroom behind him and went about his business,
doing everything with great deliberation and pausing
before each move so as to examine its effect on the eyes and
minds of the detectives who would come on board at Southampton.</p>

<p class="pindent">First he tied an ash-tray in his bloodstained shirt to weight it
and went to the porthole and threw the shirt as far out as he
could. The men’s tuxedos were hanging behind the door. He
took the handkerchiefs out of the breast pockets and wrapped
them round his hands and searched through the cupboards and
the chest of drawers until he found the white-haired man’s
evening shirts. He put one on and stood for a moment in the
centre of the cabin thinking. Then he gritted his teeth and
heaved the fat man into a sitting position, took off the fat man’s
shirt and went to the porthole and took out his Beretta, held it
against the small hole over the heart of the shirt and fired
another bullet through the hole. Now there was a smoke smudge
round the hole to look like suicide. He dressed the corpse again
in its shirt, wiped his Beretta thoroughly, pressed the fingers of
the dead man’s right hand all over it, and finally fitted the gun
into his hand with the index finger on the trigger.</p>

<p class="pindent">After another pause in the middle of the room, he took Kidd’s
tuxedo down from its hook and dressed the corpse of Kidd in it.
Then he dragged the man across the floor to the porthole and,
sweating with the effort, heaved him up into the porthole and
pushed him through.</p>

<p class="pindent">He wiped the porthole for prints and paused again, getting
his breath and surveying the small stage, and then he went over
to the card table that stood, with the litter of an unfinished
game, against the wall, and upset it on the floor so that the cards
scattered on the carpet. As an afterthought he went again to the
fat man’s body, extracted the wad of notes from his hip-pocket
and strewed them amongst the cards.</p>

<p class="pindent">Surely the picture would stand up. There would be the
mystery of the bullet fired into the bed by the dying Kidd, but
that would have been part of the struggle. There were three
shots gone from the Beretta and three cartridges on the floor.
Two of the bullets could have been in the body of Kidd which
was now in the Atlantic. There were the two sheets he would
have to steal off the second bed. Their loss would be unexplained.
Perhaps Wint had wrapped Kidd’s body in them as a
shroud before he pushed Kidd out of the porthole. That would
fit in with Wint’s remorse and suicide following the gunfight
over the cards.</p>

<p class="pindent">At all events, reflected Bond, it would stand up until the
police arrived at the dock, and by that time he and Tiffany
would be off the ship and away and the only trace of them in
the cabin would be Bond’s Beretta, and that, like all other guns
belonging to the Secret Service, had no numbers.</p>

<p class="pindent">He sighed and shrugged his shoulders. And now to take the
sheets and get Tiffany back to his cabin without being seen, cut
down the rope dangling from his porthole, throw it out into the
sea with the spare magazines for the Beretta and the empty
holster and then, at last, an age of sleep with her dear body
dovetailed against his and his arms round her forever.</p>

<p class="pindent">Forever?</p>

<p class="pindent">As he walked slowly across the cabin to the bathroom, Bond
met the blank eyes of the body on the floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">And the eyes of the man whose Blood Group had been F spoke
to him and said, ‘Mister. Nothing is forever. Only death is
permanent. Nothing is forever except what you did to me.’</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_25">25<br class="lgl"/> <span class="gesp">THE PIPELINE CLOSES</span></h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HERE was now no scorpion living in the roots of the great
thorn bush which stood at the junction of the three African
states. The smuggler from the mines had nothing to occupy his
mind except an endless column of Driver ants flowing along
between the low walls which the Soldiers had built on both sides
of the three-inch highway.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was hot and sticky and the man hiding in the thorn bush
was impatient and ill at ease. This was the last time he would
make the rendezvous. That was definite. They would have to
find someone else. Of course he would be fair with them. He
would warn them he was quitting and tell them the reason—the
new dental assistant who had joined the staff, and who didn’t
seem to know quite enough about dentistry. The man was certainly
a spy—the careful eyes, the little ginger moustache, the
pipe, the clean fingernails. Had one of the boys been caught?
Had one of them turned Queen’s evidence?</p>

<p class="pindent">The smuggler shifted his position. Where the hell was the
plane? He picked up a handful of dirt and threw it into the
middle of the flowing column of ants. They hesitated and spilled
over the walls of their road as the hurrying rear ranks crowded
into them. Then the Soldiers started frantically digging and
carrying and in a few minutes the highway was clear.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man took off his shoe and slapped it down hard across
the moving column. There was another brief moment of confusion.
Then the ants set upon the dead bodies and devoured
them and the road was open again and the black river flowed on.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man swore briefly in Afrikaans and pulled on his shoe.
Black bastards. He would show them. Crouching, and holding
up an arm against the thorns, he stamped along the column of
ants and out into the moonlight. That would give them something
to think about.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he forgot the hatred he had for all black things and
cocked his head towards the north. Thank heavens! He moved
round the bush to get the torches and the packet of diamonds
out of the tool boxes.</p>

<p class="pindent">A mile away in the low bush the big iron ear of the sound-detector
had already stopped searching, and the operator, who
had been softly calling the range to the group of three men
beside the army truck, now said: “Thirty miles. Speed one-twenty.
Height nine hundred.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond glanced at his watch. “Looks as if midnight at full moon
is the rendezvous,” he said. “And he’ll be about ten minutes
late.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Looks like it, Sir,” said the officer from the Freetown Garrison
Force who was standing next to him. He turned to the
third man. “Corporal. Make sure there’s no metal showing
through the camouflage net. This moon’ll pick up anything.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The truck was standing under cover of the low bush on a dirt
track that ran across the plain in the direction of the village of
Telebadou in French Guinea. That night, they had started off
from the hills as soon as the locator had picked up the sound of
the dentist’s motor-cycle on the parallel track. They had driven
without lights, and they had stopped as soon as the motor-cycle
had stopped and there was no longer protection from the noise
of its engine. They had put a camouflage net over the truck
and over the locator and over the bulge of the Bofors mounted
beside it. Then they had waited, not knowing what to expect at
the dentist’s rendezvous—another motor-cycle, a rider on a
horse, a jeep, an aeroplane?</p>

<p class="pindent">Now they could hear the distant clatter in the sky. Bond gave
a short laugh. “Helicopter,” he said. “Nothing else makes that
racket. Get ready to take the net down when he lands. We may
have to give him a warning shot. Is the loud-hailer switched
on?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, Sir,” said the Corporal at the locator. “And he’s coming
in quick. You should be able to see him in a minute. See those
lights just come on, Sir? Must be the landing ground.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond glanced at the four thin shafts of light, and then he
looked up again into the great African sky.</p>

<p class="pindent">So here came the last of them, the last of the gang, and yet
the first. The man he’d taken a look at in Hatton Garden. The
first of the Spangled Mob, the gang that had rated so high in
Washington. The only one, except the harmless, rather likeable,
Shady Tree, Bond had not yet had to kill—or, he thought of the
Pink Garter Saloon and the two men from Detroit, almost kill.
Not that he had wanted to kill these people. The job M had
given him had only been to find out about them. But, one by
one, they had tried to kill him and his friends. Violence had
been their first resort, not their last. Violence and cruelty
were their only weapons. The two men in the Chevrolet
in Las Vegas who had shot at him and hit Ernie Cureo. The
two men in the Jaguar who had bludgeoned Ernie and had been
the first to draw guns when it came to the fight. Seraffimo
Spang, who had started to torture him to death and had then
tried to shoot them or smash them down on the railway track.
Wint and Kidd, who had given Tingaling Bell the treatment,
and then Bond, and then Tiffany Case. And, of the seven, he
had killed five—not because he liked it, but because somebody
had had to. And he had had luck and three good friends, Felix
and Ernie and Tiffany. And the bad men had died.</p>

<p class="pindent">And now here came the last of the bad men, the man who had
ordered his death, and Tiffany’s, the man who, according to M,
had built up the traffic in diamonds, organized the pipeline and
run it ruthlessly and efficiently through the years.</p>

<p class="pindent">On the telephone to Boscombe Down, M had been brief and
his voice had had an edge to it. He had reached Bond on the Air
Ministry line a few minutes before the Canberra was due to take
off for Freetown. Bond had taken the call in the Station Commander’s
office, with the scream of the Canberra testing her jets
in the background.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Glad you got back all right.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thank you, Sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What’s this in the evening papers about a double killing in
the <span class="it">Queen Elizabeth</span>?” There was more than suspicion in M’s
voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">“They were the two killers from the gang, Sir. Travelling as
Winter and Kitteridge. My steward told me they were supposed
to have had a row over cards.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Do you think your steward was right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It sounds possible, Sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a pause. “Do the police think so?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I haven’t seen any of them, Sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’ll talk to Vallance.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, Sir,” said Bond. He knew that this was M’s way of
saying that, if Bond had killed the men, M would make sure
that neither Bond nor the Service was mentioned at the inquest.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Anyway,” said M, “they were small people. This man Jack
Spang, or Rufus Saye, or ABC, or whatever he calls himself.
I want you to get him. As far as I can make out he’s going back
down the pipeline. Sealing it off. Probably killing as he goes.
The end of the line is this dentist. Try and get them both. I’ve
had 2804 working alongside the dentist for the last week or so,
and Freetown think they’ve got the local picture clear enough.
But I want to close this case and get you back on your proper
job. This has been a messy business. Never liked it from the
first. More luck than good management that we’ve got as far
as we have.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, Sir,” said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">“What about this Case girl?” said M. “I’ve talked to Vallance.
He doesn’t want to prosecute unless you feel strongly about it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Was M’s voice a shade too indifferent?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond tried to prevent his answer being too breezy. “She’s been
a great help, Sir,” he said, easily he hoped. “Perhaps we could
decide when I’ve put in my final report.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Where is she now?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The black receiver was getting slippery in Bond’s hand. “She’s
on her way to London in a Daimler Hire, Sir. I’m putting her
up in my flat. In the spare room, that is. Very good housekeeper.
She’ll look after her until I get back. I’m sure she’ll be all right,
Sir.” Bond took out a handkerchief and wiped the sweat off his
face.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m sure,” said M. There was no irony in his voice. “All
right, then. Well, best of luck.” There was a pause. “Look after
yourself. And,” the voice at the other end was suddenly gruff,
“don’t think I’m not pleased with the way things have gone so
far. Exceeded your brief, of course, but you seem to have stood
up to these people very well. Goodbye, James.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Goodbye, Sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked up into the spangled sky and thought of M, and
of Tiffany, and hoped that this would really be the end, and that
it would be quick and easy, and that he would soon be home.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">The smuggler from the mines stood and waited, holding the
fourth torch in his hand. There it was. Coming right across the
moon. Hell of a noise as usual. That was another risk he’d be
glad to get away from.</p>

<p class="pindent">Down it came, and now it was hovering twenty feet above his
head. The hand came out and flashed A, and the man on the
ground winked back the B and the C. Then the rotor blades
flattened and softly the great iron insect sank to the ground.</p>

<p class="pindent">The dust settled. The diamond smuggler took his hand away
from his eyes and watched the pilot climb down his small ladder
to the ground. He was wearing a flying helmet and goggles.
Unusual. And he looked taller than the German. The man’s
spine tingled. Who was this? He walked slowly to meet him.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Got the stuff?” Two cold eyes under straight black brows
looked sharply out from behind the goggles. They were hidden
as the man’s head moved and the moon caught the glass. Now
there were just two round blazing white circles in the middle
of the shiny black leather helmet.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes,” said the man from the mines nervously. “But where’s
the German?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“He won’t be coming again.” The two white circles stared
blindly at the smuggler. “I am ABC. I am closing down the
pipeline.”</p>

<p class="pindent">It was an American voice, hard and flat and final.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Automatically the smuggler’s hand went inside his shirt. He
took out the moist packet and held it out as if it was some kind
of a peace offering. Like the scorpion, a month earlier, he sensed
the raised stone above him.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Give me a hand with the gas.”</p>

<p class="pindent">It was the voice of an overseer giving an order to a coolie, but
the smuggler stepped quickly forward to obey.</p>

<p class="pindent">They worked in silence. Then it was finished and they were
on the ground again. The smuggler had been thinking desperately.
He summoned up the voice of an equal partner, the voice
of someone who knew the score and had an equal control.</p>

<p class="pindent">He peered into the patch of indigo blackness where the pilot
stood with his hand on the ladder.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’ve been thinking things over and I’m afraid . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">And then the voice stopped and the lips drew back from the
teeth in the open mouth, and the mouth began to make a noise
between a snarl and a scream.</p>

<p class="pindent">The gun in the pilot’s hand stammered three times. The
smuggler said “Oh” in an obsequious voice. He pitched backwards
into the dust and gave one heave and lay still.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’t move.” The clanging voice came over the plain with
the screeching echo of the amplifier. “You’re covered.” There
was the sound of an engine starting up.</p>

<p class="pindent">The pilot didn’t wait to wonder about the voice. He leapt for
the ladder. The door of the cockpit slammed and there was the
whirr of the self-starter. The engine roared and the rotor blades
swung and slowly gathered speed until they were two whirlpools
of silver. Then there was a jerk and the helicopter was in
the air and climbing vertically straight up into the sky.</p>

<p class="pindent">Down among the low bush the truck stopped with a jerk and
Bond leapt for the iron saddle of the Bofors.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Up, Corporal,” he snapped to the man at the elevation lever.
He bent his eyes to the grid-sight as the muzzle rose towards the
moon. He reached to pull the firing selector lever off ‘Safe’ and
put it on ‘Single Fire’. “And left ten.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’ll keep feeding you tracer.” The officer beside Bond had
two racks of five yellow-painted shells in his hands.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s feet settled into the trigger-pedals and now he had the
helicopter in the centre of the grid. “Steady,” he said quietly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Boompa’.</p>

<p class="pindent">The spangled tracer swung lazily up into the sky just below
the speed of sound.</p>

<p class="pindent">Low and left.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Corporal delicately twisted the two levers.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Boompa’.</p>

<p class="pindent">The tracer curved away high over the rising machine. Bond
reached forward and pulled the selector lever to ‘Auto Fire’.
The movement of his hand was reluctant. Now it would be
certain death. He was going to have to do it again.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Boompa—boompa—boompa—boompa—boompa.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The red fire sprayed across the sky. Still the helicopter went
on rising towards the moon, and now it was turning away to
the north.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Boompa—boompa’.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a flash of yellow light near the tail rotor and the
distant bang of an explosion.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Got him,” said the officer. He picked up a pair of night-glasses.
“Tail rotor’s gone,” he said. And then, excitedly, “Gosh.
It looks as if the whole cabin’s going round with the main
rotor. Pilot must be getting hell.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Any more?” said Bond, holding the whirring machine in his
sights.</p>

<p class="pindent">“No, Sir,” said the officer. “Like to get him alive if we can.
But it looks as if . . . yes, he’s out of control now. Coming down
in great swoops. Must be something wrong with the main rotor
blades. There he goes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond raised his head from the grid-sight and shaded his eyes
against the blazing moon.</p>

<p class="pindent">Yes. There he was. Only about a thousand feet up now, the
engine roaring and the great blades whirring uselessly as the
tangle of metal pitched and yawed down the sky in long drunken
staggers.</p>

<p class="pindent">Jack Spang. The man who had ordered Bond’s death. Who
had ordered Tiffany’s death. The man Bond had only once seen
for a few minutes in an overheated room in Covent Garden.
Mr Rufus B. Saye. Of The House of Diamonds. Vice-President
for Europe. The man who played golf at Sunningdale and
visited Paris once a month. ‘Model citizen,’ M had called him.
Mr Spang of the Spangled Mob, who had just killed a man—the
final one of how many others?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond could imagine the scene in the narrow cockpit, the big
man holding on with one hand and wrenching at the controls
with the other as he watched the needle of the altimeter dip
down through the hundreds. And there would be the red glare
of terror in the eyes, and the hundred thousand pound pocketful
of diamonds would be just so much deadweight, and the gun
which had been a strong right arm since boyhood would be no
comfort.</p>

<p class="pindent">“He’s coming right back to the bush,” shouted the Corporal
above the clatter in the sky.</p>

<p class="pindent">“He’s a goner now,” said the Captain, half to himself.</p>

<p class="pindent">They watched the last bucketing lurches and then they held
their breath as the aircraft, see-sawing wildly, gave a final tip to
its nose and, as if the bush had been its enemy, made an angry
dive through a twenty-yard curve and hurled itself and the
threshing rotors into the stack of thorns.</p>

<p class="pindent">Before the echoes of the crash had died, there came a hollow
boom out of the heart of the bush followed by a jagged ball of
flame that grew and billowed up into the air so that the moon
was dimmed and the whole plain was bathed in an orange glare.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Captain was the first to speak.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Ouch!” he said with feeling. He slowly lowered his night-glasses
and turned to Bond. “Well, Sir,” he said resignedly.
“That’s just about that. ’Fraid it’s going to be morning before
we can get anywhere near that lot. And then it’s going to be
hours more before we can start raking about in it. And this is
going to bring the French frontier guards along at the gallop.
Luckily we’re on pretty good terms with them, but the Governor’s
going to have a fine time arguing the loss with Dakar.”
The officer saw a vista of paperwork stretching ahead. The
prospect made him tireder than he already was. He was matter-of-fact.
He had had enough for one day. “Mind if we get a bit
of shut-eye, Sir?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Go ahead,” said Bond. He looked at his watch. “Better get
under the truck. Sun’ll be coming up in about four hours. Not
feeling tired myself. I’ll keep an eye out in case the fire looks
like spreading.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The officer gave a curious glance at this quiet, enigmatic man
who had suddenly arrived in the Protectorate amidst a flurry of
‘Absolute Priority’ signals. If ever a man needed sleep. . . . But all
this was nothing to do with Freetown. London stuff. “Thanks,
Sir,” he said and jumped down from the truck.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond slowly took his feet off the trigger-pedals and sat back
in the iron saddle. Automatically, with his eyes still on the leaping
flames, his hands felt in the pockets of the faded khaki
bush-shirt, borrowed from the Garrison CO, for his lighter and
cigarettes, and he took out a cigarette and lit it and put the
things back in his pockets.</p>

<p class="pindent">So this was the end of the diamond pipeline. And the last page
on the file. He took a deep lungful of smoke and let it out
between his teeth in a long, quiet sigh. Six corpses to love. Game
and set.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond put up a hand and wiped it across his dripping forehead.
He pushed back the damp lock of hair above the right eyebrow
and the red blaze lit up the hard lean face and flickered in the
tired eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">So this great red full stop marked the end of the Spangled
Mob and the end of their fabulous traffic in diamonds. But not
the end of the diamonds that were baking at the heart of the
fire. They would survive and move off again across the world,
discoloured, perhaps, but indestructible, as permanent as death.</p>

<p class="pindent">And Bond suddenly remembered the eyes of the corpse which
had once had a Blood Group F. They had been wrong. Death
is forever. But so are diamonds.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond dropped down off the truck and started walking slowly
towards the leaping fire. He smiled grimly to himself. All this
business about death and diamonds was too solemn. For Bond
it was just the end of another adventure. Another adventure for
which a wry phrase of Tiffany Case might be the epitaph. He
could see the passionate, ironical mouth saying the words:</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It reads better than it lives.’</p>
