<p class="pindent">I was running away. I was running away from England,
from my childhood, from the winter, from a sequence
of untidy, unattractive love-affairs, from the few sticks
of furniture and jumble of overworn clothes that my
London life had collected around me; and I was
running away from drabness, fustiness, snobbery, the
claustrophobia of close horizons and from my inability,
although I am quite an attractive rat, to make headway
in the rat-race. In fact, I was running away from almost
everything except the law.</p>

<p class="pindent">And I had run a very long way indeed—almost,
exaggerating a bit, halfway round the world. In fact, I
had come all the way from London to The Dreamy
Pines Motor Court which is ten miles west of Lake
George, the famous American tourist resort in the
Adirondacks—that vast expanse of mountains, lakes
and pine forests which forms most of the northern
territory of New York State. I had started on September
1st, and it was now Friday October 13th. When I had
left, the grimy little row of domesticated maples in my
square had been green, or as green as any tree can be
in London in August. Now, in the billion-strong army
of pine trees that marched away northwards towards
the Canadian border, the real, wild maples flamed here
and there like shrapnel-bursts. And I felt that I, or at
any rate my skin, had changed just as much—from
the grimy sallowness that had been the badge of my
London life to the snap and colour and sparkle of
living out of doors and going to bed early and all those
other dear dull things that had been part of my life in
Quebec before it was decided that I must go to England
and learn to be a ‘lady’. Very unfashionable, of course,
this cherry-ripe, strength-through-joy complexion, and
I had even stopped using lipstick and nail varnish, but
to me it had been like sloughing off a borrowed skin
and getting back into my own, and I was childishly
happy and pleased with myself whenever I looked in
the mirror (that’s another thing—I’ll never say ‘looking-glass’
again; I just don’t have to any more) and found
myself not wanting to paint a different face over my
own. I’m not being smug about this. I was just running
away from the person I’d been for the past five years.
I wasn’t particularly pleased with the person I was now,
but I had hated and despised the other one, and I was
glad to be rid of her face.</p>

<p class="pindent">Station WOKO (they might have dreamed up a
grander callsign!) in Albany, the capital of New York
State and about fifty miles due south of where I was,
announced that it was six o’clock. The weather report
that followed included a storm warning with gale-force
winds. The storm was moving down from the north
and would hit Albany around 8 pm. That meant that
I would be having a noisy night. I didn’t mind. Storms
don’t frighten me, and although the nearest living soul,
as far as I knew, was ten miles away up the not very
good secondary road to Lake George, the thought of
the pines that would soon be thrashing outside, the
thunder and lightning and rain, made me already feel
snug and warm and protected in anticipation. And
alone! But above all alone! ‘Loneliness becomes a lover,
solitude a darling sin.’ Where had I read that? Who
had written it? It was so exactly the way I felt, the way
that, as a child, I had always felt until I had forced
myself to ‘get into the swim’, ‘be one of the crowd’—a
good sort, on the ball, hep. And what a hash I had
made of ‘togetherness’! I shrugged the memory of
failure away. Everyone doesn’t have to live in a heap.
Painters, writers, musicians are lonely people. So are
statesmen and admirals and generals. But then, I added
to be fair, so are criminals and lunatics. Let’s just say,
not to be too flattering, that true individuals are lonely.
It’s not a virtue, the reverse if anything. One ought to
share and communicate if one is to be a useful member
of the tribe. The fact that I was so much happier when
I was alone was surely the sign of a faulty, a neurotic
character. I had said this so often to myself in the past
five years that now, that evening, I just shrugged my
shoulders and, hugging my solitude to me, walked
across the big lobby to the door and went out to have
a last look at the evening.</p>

<p class="pindent">I hate pine trees. They are dark and stand very still
and you can’t shelter under them or climb them. They
are very dirty, with a most un-treelike black dirt, and
if you get this dirt mixed with their resin they make
you really filthy. I find their jagged shapes vaguely
inimical, and the way they mass so closely together
gives me the impression of an army of spears barring
my passage. The only good thing about them is their
smell, and, when I can get hold of it, I use pine-needle
essence in my bath. Here, in the Adirondacks, the
endless vista of pine trees was positively sickening.
They clothe every square yard of earth in the valleys
and climb up to the top of every mountain so that
the impression is of a spiky carpet spread to the
horizon—an endless vista of rather stupid-looking
green pyramids waiting to be cut down for matches
and coat-hangers and copies of the <span class="it">New York Times</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">Five acres or so of these stupid trees had been
cleared to build the motel, which is all that this place
really was. ‘Motel’ isn’t a good word any longer. It has
become smart to use ‘Motor Court’ or ‘Ranch Cabins’
ever since motels became associated with prostitution,
gangsters and murders, for all of which their anonymity
and lack of supervision is a convenience. The site,
tourist-wise, in the lingo of the trade, was a good one.
There was this wandering secondary road through the
forest, which was a pleasant alternative route between
Lake George and Glens Falls to the south, and halfway
along it was a small lake, cutely called Dreamy Waters,
that is a traditional favourite with picnickers. It was on
the southern shore of this lake that the motel had
been built, its reception lobby facing the road with,
behind this main building, the rooms fanning out in
a semicircle. There were forty rooms with kitchen,
shower and lavatory, and they all had some kind of a
view of the lake behind them. The whole construction
and design was the latest thing—glazed pitch-pine
frontages and pretty timber roofs all over knobbles,
air-conditioning, television in every cabin, children’s
playground, swimming pool, golf range out over the
lake with floating balls (fifty balls, one dollar)—all the
gimmicks. Food? Cafeteria in the lobby, and grocery
and liquor deliveries twice a day from Lake George.
All this for ten dollars single and sixteen double. No
wonder that, with around two hundred thousand
dollars’ capital outlay and a season lasting only from
July 1st to the beginning of October, or, so far as the
<span class="calibre10">NO VACANCY</span> sign was concerned, from July 14th to
Labor Day, the owners were finding the going hard.
Or so those dreadful Phanceys had told me when
they’d taken me on as receptionist for only thirty dollars
a week plus keep. Thank heavens they were out of my
hair! Song in my heart? There had been the whole
heavenly choir at six o’clock that morning when their
shiny station-wagon had disappeared down the road
on their way to Glens Falls and then to Troy where
the monsters came from. Mr Phancey had made a last
grab at me and I hadn’t been quick enough. His free
hand had run like a fast lizard over my body before I
had crunched my heel into his instep. He had let go
then. When his contorted face had cleared, he said
softly, ‘All right, sex-box. Just see that you mind camp
good until the boss comes to take over the keys
tomorrow midday. Happy dreams tonight.’ Then he
had grinned a grin I hadn’t understood, and had gone
over to the station-wagon where his wife had been
watching from the driver’s seat. ‘Come on, Jed,’ she
had said sharply. ‘You can work off those urges on
West Street tonight.’ She put the car in gear and called
over to me sweetly, ‘ ’Bye now, cutie-pie. Write us every
day.’ Then she had wiped the crooked smile off her
face and I caught a last glimpse of her withered, hatchet
profile as the car turned out on to the road. Phew!
What a couple! Right out of a book—and what a
book! Dear Diary! Well, people couldn’t come much
worse, and now they’d gone. From now on, on my
travels, the human race <span class="it">must</span> improve!</p>

<p class="pindent">I had been standing there, looking down the way
the Phanceys had gone, remembering them. Now I
turned and looked to the north to see after the weather.
It had been a beautiful day, Swiss clear and hot for the
middle of October, but now high fretful clouds, black
with jagged pink hair from the setting sun, were piling
down the sky. Fast little winds were zigzagging among
the forest tops and every now and then they hit the
single yellow light above the deserted gas station down
the road at the tail of the lake and set it swaying. When
a longer gust reached me, cold and buffeting, it brought
with it the whisper of a metallic squeak from the
dancing light, and the first time this happened I shivered
deliciously at the little ghostly noise. On the lake
shore, beyond the last of the cabins, small waves were
lapping fast against the stones and the gun-metal
surface of the lake was fretted with sudden catspaws
that sometimes showed a fleck of white. But, in
between the angry gusts, the air was still, and the
sentinel trees across the road and behind the motel
seemed to be pressing silently closer to huddle round
the camp-fire of the brightly lit building at my back.</p>

<p class="pindent">I suddenly wanted to go to the loo, and I smiled to
myself. It was the piercing tickle that comes to children
during hide-and-seek-in-the-dark and ‘Sardines’, when,
in your cupboard under the stairs, you heard the soft
creak of a floor-board, the approaching whisper of
the searchers. Then you clutched yourself in thrilling
anguish and squeezed your legs together and waited
for the ecstasy of discovery, the crack of light from
the opening door and then—the supreme moment—your
urgent ‘Ssh! Come in with me!’, the softly closing
door and the giggling warm body pressed tight against
your own.</p>

<p class="pindent">Standing there, a ‘big girl’ now, I remembered it all
and recognized the sensual itch brought on by a fleeting
apprehension—the shiver down the spine, the intuitive
goose-flesh that come from the primitive fear-signals
of animal ancestors. I was amused and I hugged the
moment to me. Soon the thunderheads would burst
and I would step back from the howl and chaos of
the storm into my well-lighted, comfortable cave, make
myself a drink, listen to the radio and feel safe and
cosseted.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was getting dark. Tonight there would be no evening
chorus from the birds. They had long ago read the signs
and disappeared into their own shelters in the forest, as
had the animals—the squirrels and the chipmunks and
the deer. In all this huge, wild area there was now only
me out in the open. I took a last few deep breaths of
the soft, moist air. The humidity had strengthened the
scent of pine and moss, and now there was also a strong
underlying armpit smell of earth. It was almost as if
the forest was sweating with the same pleasurable excitement
I was feeling. Somewhere, from quite close, a
nervous owl asked loudly ‘Who?’ and then was silent.
I took a few steps away from the lighted doorway and
stood in the middle of the dusty road, looking north.
A strong gust of wind hit me and blew back my hair.
Lightning threw a quick blue-white hand across the
horizon. Seconds later, thunder growled softly like a
wakening guard dog, and then the big wind came and
the tops of the trees began to dance and thrash and
the yellow light over the gas station jigged and blinked
down the road as if to warn me. It <span class="it">was</span> warning me.
Suddenly the dancing light was blurred with rain, its
luminosity fogged by an advancing grey sheet of water.
The first heavy drops hit me, and I turned and ran.</p>

<p class="pindent">I banged the door behind me, locked it and put up
the chain. I was only just in time. Then the avalanche
crashed down and settled into a steady roar of water
whose patterns of sound varied from a heavy drumming
on the slanting timbers of the roof to a higher,
more precise slashing at the windows. In a moment
these sounds were joined by the busy violence of the
overflow drainpipes. And the noisy background pattern
of the storm was set.</p>

<p class="pindent">I was still standing there, cosily listening, when the
thunder, that had been creeping quietly up behind my
back, sprang its ambush. Suddenly lightning blazed in
the room, and at the same instant there came a blockbusting
crash that shook the building and made the
air twang like piano wire. It was just one, single, colossal
explosion that might have been a huge bomb falling
only yards away. There was a sharp tinkle as a piece
of glass fell out of one of the windows on to the
floor, and then the noise of water pattering in on to
the linoleum.</p>

<p class="pindent">I didn’t move. I couldn’t. I stood and cringed, my
hands over my ears. I hadn’t meant it to be like this!
The silence, that had been deafening, resolved itself
back into the roar of the rain, the roar that had been
so comforting but that now said, ‘You hadn’t thought
it could be so bad. You had never seen a storm in
these mountains. Pretty flimsy this little shelter of
yours, really. How’d you like to have the lights put out
as a start? Then the crash of a thunderbolt through
that matchwood ceiling of yours? Then, just to finish
you off, lightning to set fire to the place—perhaps
electrocute you? Or shall we just frighten you so much
that you dash out in the rain and try and make those
ten miles to Lake George. Like to be alone do you?
Well, just try this for size!’ Again the room turned
blue-white, again, just overhead, there came the ear-splitting
crack of the explosion, but this time the crack
widened and racketed to and fro in a furious cannonade
that set the cups and glasses rattling behind the bar
and made the woodwork creak with the pressure of
the sound-waves.</p>

<p class="pindent">My legs felt weak and I faltered to the nearest chair
and sat down, my head in my hands. How could I have
been so foolish, so, so impudent? If only someone
would come, someone to stay with me, someone to
tell me that this was only a storm! But it wasn’t! It was
catastrophe, the end of the world! And all aimed at
<span class="it">me</span>! Now! It would be coming again! Any minute now!
I must do something, get help! But the Phanceys had
paid off the telephone company and the service had
been disconnected. There was only one hope! I got
up and ran to the door, reaching up for the big switch
that controlled the ‘Vacancy/No Vacancy’ sign in red
neon above the threshold. If I put it to ‘Vacancy’,
there might be someone driving down the road.
Someone who would be glad of shelter. But, as I pulled
the switch, the lightning, that had been watching me,
crackled viciously in the room, and, as the thunder
crashed, I was seized by a giant hand and hurled to
the floor.</p>
