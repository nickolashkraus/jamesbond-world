<p class="pindent">It takes a long time to write these things, but only
minutes to remember them, and when I came out of
my daydream in the motel armchair WOKO was still
playing ‘Music To Kiss By’ and it was someone who
may have been Don Shirley improvising through ‘Ain’t
She Sweet’. The ice in my drink had dissolved. I got
up and put in some more from the icebox and I went
back and curled up in my chair and drank a careful
mouthful of the bourbon to make it last and lit another
cigarette, and at once I was back again in that endless
summer.</p>

<p class="pindent">Derek’s last term came to an end and we had
exchanged four letters each. His first one had begun
‘Dearest’ and ended with love and kisses, and I had
compromised with ‘Dear’ and ‘love’. His were mostly
about how many runs he had made, and mine were
about the dances I had been to and the films and plays
I had seen. He was going to spend the summer at his
home, and he was very excited about a second-hand
MG his parents were going to give him and would I
come out with him in it? Susan was surprised when I
said that I wouldn’t be coming up to Scotland and that
I wanted to stay on in the flat at any rate for the time
being. I hadn’t told her the truth about Derek, and
because I always got up earlier than her, she didn’t
know about his letters. It wasn’t like me to be secretive,
but I treasured my ‘love-affair’ as I described it to
myself, and it seemed to be so fragile and probably
full of disappointments that I thought even to talk
about it might bring it bad luck. For all I knew I might
be just one in a whole row of Derek’s girls. He was
so attractive and grand, at any rate at school, that I
imagined a long queue of ‘Mayfair’ sisters, all in
organdie and all with titles, at his beck and call. So I
simply said that I wanted to look around for a job and
perhaps I would come up later, and in due course
Susan went north and a fifth letter came from Derek
saying would I come down next Saturday on the twelve
o’clock from Paddington and he would meet me with
the car at Windsor station?</p>

<p class="pindent">And so began our regular and delicious routine. The
first day he met me on the platform. We were rather
shy, but he was so excited about his car that he quickly
hurried me out to see it. It was wonderful—black with
red leather upholstery and red wire wheels and all sorts
of racing gimmicks like a strap round the bonnet and
an outsize filler cap on the gas tank and the badge of
the BRDC. We climbed in and I tied Derek’s coloured
silk handkerchief round my hair and the exhaust made
a wonderful sexy noise as we accelerated across the
High Street lights and turned up along the river. That
day he took me as far as Bray, to show off the car, and
we tore through the lanes with Derek doing quite
unnecessary racing changes on the flattest curves.
Sitting so near the ground, even at fifty-one felt as if
one was doing at least a hundred, and to begin with I
clutched on to the safety grip on the dashboard and
hoped for the best. But Derek was a good driver and
I soon got confidence in him and controlled my trembles.
He took me to a fearfully smart place, the Hotel
de Paris, and we had smoked salmon, which cost extra,
and roast chicken and ice cream and then he hired an
electric canoe from the boat-house next door and we
chugged sedately up-river and under Maidenhead
Bridge and found a little backwater, just this side of
Cookham Lock, where Derek rammed the canoe far
in under the branches. He had brought a portable
gramophone with him and I scrambled down to his
end of the canoe and we sat and later lay side by side
and listened to the records and watched a small bird
hopping about in the network of branches over our
heads. It was a beautiful, drowsy afternoon and we
kissed but didn’t go any further and I felt reassured
that Derek didn’t after all think I was ‘easy’. Later the
midges came and we nearly upset the canoe trying to
get it out of the creek backwards, but then we were
going fast down-river with the current and there were
a lot of other boats with couples and families in them,
but I was quite certain we looked the gayest and handsomest
of everyone. We drove back and went down
to Eton and had scrambled eggs and coffee in a place
called The Thatched House that Derek knew about
and then he suggested we should go to the cinema.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Royalty Kinema was on Farquhar Street, one
of the small streets leading down from the Castle
towards the Ascot road. It was a meagre-looking place,
showing two Westerns, a cartoon and so-called ‘News’
that consisted of what the Queen had been doing a
month ago. I realized why Derek had chosen it when
he paid twelve shillings for a box. There was one on
each side of the projection room, about six feet square,
dark and with two chairs, and as soon as we went in
Derek pulled his chair close to me and began kissing
and feeling me. At first I thought, Oh, God! Is this
where he brings them? But after a bit I sort of melted
and then his hands were slowly exploring me and they
were gentle and seemed to know, and then they were
there and I hid my face against his shoulder and bit
my lip with the exquisite tingle and then it was all over
and I was flooded with warmth and tears came by
themselves out of my eyes and wet the collar of his
shirt.</p>

<p class="pindent">He kissed me gently and whispered that he loved
me and that I was the most wonderful girl in the world.
But I sat up and away from him and dabbed at my
eyes and tried to watch the film and reflected that I
had lost my virginity, or some kind of virginity, and
that now he would never respect me again. But then
the interval came and he bought me an ice and put
his arm round the back of my chair and whispered
that it was being the most wonderful day of his life
and that we must have the same day over and over
again. And I told myself not to be silly. That this was
just petting. Everybody did it, and anyway it had been
rather marvellous and it wasn’t as if I would get a baby
or anything. Besides, boys wanted to pet and if I didn’t
do it with him he would find some other girl who
would. So when the lights went out again and his hands
came back it seemed natural that they should go to
my breasts and that excited me. Then his breath came
panting against my neck and he said, ‘Oh, Baby!’ in a
long-drawn-out kind of sigh and I felt a sort of pang
of excitement as if some kind of barrier had
disappeared from between us and I felt motherly
towards him and kissed him and from that moment
on we were somehow different kinds of friends.</p>

<p class="pindent">He drove me back to catch the last train for London
and we arranged to meet at the same time on the next
Saturday and he stood and waved for as long as I could
see him under the yellow lights of that darling little
station and so our real love-affair began. It was always
the same, with perhaps different places for luncheon
and high tea, the river, the gramophone, the little box
in the cinema, but now there was added the extra thrill
of the physical side and always, in the boat, the car,
the cinema, our hands were on each other’s bodies,
more lingering, more expert as the endless summer
drew on into September.</p>

<p class="pindent">In my memory of those days the sun is always
shining and the willows dip into water as limpid clear
as the sky. Swans ride in the shadows of the poplars
and swallows dip and skim as the Thames slips down
from Queens Eyot, past Boveney Lock and Coocoo
Weir, where we used to bathe, and on down the long
stretch through Brocas meadows towards Windsor
Bridge. It surely must have rained, there must have
been noisy holiday-makers crowding our river, there
must have been clouds in our private skies, but if there
were I can’t remember them. The weeks slipped by
like the river, sparkling, luminous, full of enchantment.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then came the last Saturday of September and,
though till then we had ignored the fact, a new chapter
had to be opened. Susan was coming back to the flat
on Monday, I had the chance of a job, and Derek was
going up to Oxford. We pretended it would all be the
same. I would explain to Susan and there would be
weekends when I could go to Oxford or Derek come
up to London. We didn’t discuss our affair. It was
obvious that it would go on. Derek had talked vaguely
of my meeting his parents, but he had never pressed
it and on our Saturdays together there were always so
many better things to do. Perhaps I thought it rather
odd that Derek seemed to have no time for me during
the week, but he played a lot of cricket and tennis and
had hosts of friends all of whom he said were a bore.
I didn’t want to get mixed up in this side of his life,
at any rate not for the present. I was happy to have
him absolutely to myself for our one day a week. I
didn’t want to share him with a crowd of other people
who would anyway make me shy. So things were left
very much in the air, and I just didn’t look beyond the
next Saturday.</p>

<p class="pindent">That day Derek was particularly affectionate and in
the evening he took me to the Bridge Hotel and we
had three rounds of gins and tonics, though usually
we hardly drank at all. And then he insisted on champagne
for dinner and by the time we got to our little
cinema we were both rather tight. I was glad, because
it would make me forget that tomorrow would mean
the turning of a new page and the breaking up of all
our darling routines. But when we got into our little
box, Derek was morose. He didn’t take me in his arms
as usual but sat a little away from me and smoked and
watched the film. I came close to him and took his
hand, but he just sat and looked straight in front of
him. I asked him what was the matter. After a moment
he said obstinately, ‘I want to sleep with you. Properly,
I mean.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I was shocked. It was his rough tone of voice. We
had talked about it of course, but it was always agreed,
more or less, that this would come ‘later’. Now I used
the same old arguments, but I was nervous and upset.
Why did he have to spoil our last evening? He argued
back, fiercely. I was being a hard-boiled virgin. It was
bad for him. Anyway, we were lovers, so why not
behave like lovers? I said I was frightened of getting
a baby. He said that was easy. There were things he
could wear. But why now? I argued. We couldn’t do
it here. Oh yes we could. There was plenty of room.
And he wanted to do it before he went up to Oxford.
It would sort of, sort of marry us.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tremulously I considered this. Perhaps there was
something in it. It would be a kind of seal on our love.
But I was frightened. Hesitantly I said had he got one
of these ‘things’? He said no, but there was an all-night
chemist and he would go and buy one. And he kissed
me and got up eagerly and walked out of the box.</p>

<p class="pindent">I sat and stared dully at the screen. Now I couldn’t
refuse him! He would come back and it would be
messy and horrible in this filthy little box in this filthy
little back-street cinema and it was going to hurt and
he would despise me afterwards for giving in. I had
an instinct to get up and run out and down to the
station and take the next train back to London. But
that would make him furious. It would hurt his vanity.
I wouldn’t be being ‘a sport’, and the rhythm of our
friendship, so much based on us both ‘having fun’,
would be wrecked. And, after all, was it fair on him
to hold this back from him? Perhaps it really was bad
for him not to be able to do it properly. And, after all,
it had to happen sometime. One couldn’t choose the
perfect moment for that particular thing. No girl ever
seemed to enjoy the first time. Perhaps it would be
better to get it over with. Anything not to make him
angry! Anything better than the danger of wrecking
our love!</p>

<p class="pindent">The door opened and there was a brief shaft of
light from the lobby. Then he was beside me, breathless
and excited. ‘I’ve got it,’ he whispered. ‘It was
terribly embarrassing. There was a girl behind the
counter. I didn’t know what to call it. I finally said,
“One of those things for not having babies. You
know.” She was cool as a cucumber. She asked me
what quality. I said the best of course. I almost thought
she was going to ask “What size?” ’ He laughed and
held me tight. I giggled feebly back. Better to ‘be a
sport’! Better not to make a drama out of it! Nowadays
nobody did. It would make it all so embarrassing,
particularly for him.</p>

<p class="pindent">His preliminary love-making was so perfunctory it
almost made me cry. Then he pushed his chair to the
back of the box and took off his coat and laid it down
on the wooden floor. When he told me to, I lay down
on it and he knelt beside me. He said to put my feet
up against the front of the box and I did, and I was
so cramped and uncomfortable that I said, ‘No, Derek!
Please! Not here!’ But then he was somehow on top
of me in a dreadful clumsy embrace and all my instinct
was somehow to help him so that at least he would
have pleasure from it and not be angry with me afterwards.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then the world fell in!</p>

<p class="pindent">There was suddenly a great gush of yellow light and
a furious voice said from above and behind me, ‘What
the hell do you think you’re doing in my cinema? Get
up, you filthy little swine.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I don’t know why I didn’t faint. Derek was standing,
his face white as a sheet. I scrambled to my feet,
banging against the wall of the box. I stood there,
waiting to be killed, waiting to be shot dead.</p>

<p class="pindent">The black silhouette in the doorway pointed at my
bag on the floor with the white scrap of my pants
beside it. ‘Pick those up.’ I bent down quickly as if I
had been hit and clutched the pants into a ball in my
hand to try and hide them. ‘Now get out!’ He stood
there half blocking the entrance, while we shambled
past him, broken people.</p>

<p class="pindent">The manager banged the door of the box shut and
got in front of us, thinking, I suppose, that we might
make a run for it. Two or three people had peeped out
of the back seats into the foyer. (The whole audience
must have heard the manager’s voice. Had the seats
below us heard the whole thing, the argument, the
pause, then Derek’s instructions what to do? I shuddered.)
The ticket woman had come out of her box
and one or two passersby, who had been examining
the programme, gazed in from under the cheap
coloured lights over the entrance.</p>

<p class="pindent">The manager was a plump, dark man with a tight
suit and a flower in his buttonhole. His face was red
with rage as he looked us up and down. ‘Filthy little
brats!’ He turned on me. ‘And I’ve seen you here before.
You’re nothing better than a common prostitute. I’ve
a damned good mind to call the police. Indecent
exposure. Disturbing the peace.’ He ran the heavy
words easily off his tongue. He must have used them
often before in his sleazy little house of private darkness.
‘Names, please.’ He took a notebook out of his
pocket and licked a stub of pencil. He was looking at
Derek. Derek stammered, ‘Er, James Grant’ (the film
had starred Cary Grant). ‘Er, 24 Acacia Road, Nettlebed.’
The manager looked up, ‘There aren’t any roads in
Nettlebed. Only the Henley-Oxford road.’ Derek said
obstinately, ‘Yes, there are. At the back,’ he added
weakly. ‘Sort of lanes.’ ‘And you?’ he turned towards
me, suspiciously. My mouth was dry. I swallowed. ‘Miss
Thompson, Audrey Thompson. 24’ (I realized it was
the same number that Derek had chosen, but I couldn’t
think of another) ‘Thomas’ (I almost said Thompson
again!) ‘Road. London.’ ‘District?’ I didn’t know what
he meant. I gaped hopelessly at him. ‘Postal district,’
he said impatiently. I remembered Chelsea. ‘SW6,’ I
said weakly. The manager snapped his book shut. ‘All
right. Get out of here, both of you.’ He pointed out
into the street. We edged nervously past him and he
followed us, still pointing. ‘And don’t ever come back
to my establishment again! I know you both! You ever
show up again, I’ll have the police on you!’</p>

<p class="pindent">The small host of sneering, accusing eyes followed
us. I took Derek’s arm (why didn’t he take mine?) and
we went out under the hideous bright lights and turned
by instinct to the right and down the hill so that we
could walk faster. We didn’t stop until we got to a side
street and we went in there and slowly started to work
our way back to where the MG was parked up the hill
from the cinema.</p>

<p class="pindent">Derek didn’t say a word until we were getting close
to the car. Then he said, matter-of-factly, ‘Mustn’t let
them get the number. I’ll go and get her, and pick you
up opposite Fullers on Windsor Hill. ‘Bout ten minutes.’
Then he freed himself from my arm and went off up
the street.</p>

<p class="pindent">I stood and watched him go, the tall, elegant figure
that was once more proud and upright, and then I
turned and went back to where a lane led up parallel
with Farquhar Street towards the Castle.</p>

<p class="pindent">I found that I still had my pants crushed in my hand.
I put them in my bag. The open bag made me think
of my appearance. I stopped under a street-light and
took out my mirror. I looked dreadful. My face was
so white it was almost green, and my eyes belonged
to a hunted animal. My hair stuck up at the back where
it had been rumpled by the floor and my mouth was
smeared by Derek’s kisses. I shuddered. ‘Filthy little
swine!’ How right! All of me felt unclean, degraded,
sinful. What would happen to us? Would the man
check on the addresses and put the police on us?
Someone would certainly remember us from today or
from other Saturdays. Someone would remember the
number of Derek’s car, some little boy who collected
car numbers. There was always some Nosey Parker at
the scene of a crime. Crime? Yes, of course it was,
one of the worst in puritan England—sex, nakedness,
indecent exposure. I imagined what the manager must
have seen when Derek got up from me. Ugh! I shivered
with disgust. But now Derek would be waiting for me.
My hands had automatically been tidying my face. I
gave it a last look. It was the best I could do. I hurried
on up the street and turned down Windsor Hill,
hugging the wall, expecting people to turn and point.
‘There she goes!’ ‘That’s her!’ ‘Filthy little swine!’</p>
