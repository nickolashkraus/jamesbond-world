<h2 id="calibre_toc_14" class="calibre8"><a id="Page_100" class="calibre9"></a>9. Then I Began to Scream</h2>

<p class="pindent">I heard a single bullet crash into the metal frame of
the door, and then, with my hand cushioning the ice-pick
so it didn’t stick into me, I was running hell for
leather across the wet grass. Mercifully the rain had let
up, but the grass was soaking and slippery under my
hopeless flat soles and I knew I wasn’t making enough
speed. I heard a door crash open behind me and
Sluggsy’s voice shouted, ‘Hold it, or you’re cold turkey!’
I began to weave, but then the shots came, carefully,
evenly spaced, and bees whipped past me and slapped
into the grass. Another ten yards and I would be at
the corner of the cabins and out of the light. I dodged
and zigzagged, my skin quivering as it waited for the
bullet. A window in the last cabin tinkled with broken
glass and I was round the corner. As I dived into the
soaking wood I heard a car start up. What was that
for?</p>

<p class="pindent">It was terrible going. The dripping pines were thick
together, their branches overlapping, and they tore at
the arms crossed over my face. It was black as pitch
and I couldn’t see a yard ahead. And then suddenly I
could, and I sobbed as I realized what the car was for,
for now its blazing headlights were holding me from
the edge of the trees. As I tried to dodge the searching
eyes, I heard the engine rev to aim the car and immediately
they had me again. There was no room for
manoeuvre and I just had to make headway in whatever
direction the trees allowed me. When would the
shooting start up again? I was a bare thirty yards inside
the forest. It would be any minute now! My breath
was sobbing out of my throat. My clothes had begun
to tear and I could feel bruises coming on my feet. I
knew I couldn’t hold out much longer. I would just
have to find the thickest tree and try and lose the lights
for a minute and crawl in under the tree and hide. But
why no bullets? I stumbled away to the right, found
brief darkness, and dived to my knees among the
soaking pine needles. There was a tree like any other,
its branches sweeping the ground, and I crawled in
under them and up against the trunk and waited for
the rasping of my breath to quieten down.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then I heard one of them coming in after me,
not softly because that was impossible, but steadily,
and stopping every now and then to listen. By now
the man, whichever it was, must realize from the silence
that I had gone to ground. If he knew anything about
tracking, he would soon find where the broken
branches and scuffed earth stopped. Then it would
only be a question of time. I softly squirmed round
to the back of the tree, away from him, and watched
the lights from the car hold steady in the glistening
wet branches above my head.</p>

<p class="pindent">The feet and the snapping twigs were coming nearer.
Now I could hear the heavy breathing. Sluggsy’s voice,
very near, said softly, ‘Come on out, baby. Or poppa
spank real hard. Da game of tag is over. Time to come
home to poppa.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The small eye of a flashlight began searching under
the trees, carefully, tree by tree. He knew I was only a
few yards away. Then the light stopped and held steady
under my tree. Sluggsy said softly, delightedly, ‘Coo-ee,
baby! Poppa find!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Had he? I lay still, hardly breathing.</p>

<p class="pindent">There came the roar and flame of a single shot, and
the bullet smacked into the tree-trunk behind my head.
‘That’s just a hastener, baby. Next time it takes your
little footsie off.’</p>

<p class="pindent">So that was what showed! I said, weary with fright,
‘All right. I’ll come. But don’t shoot!’ And I scrambled
out on all-fours, thinking hysterically, ‘This is a fine
way to go to your execution, Viv!’</p>

<p class="pindent">The man stood there, his pale head fretted with
yellow light and black shadows. His gun was pointed
at my stomach. He waved it sideways. ‘Okay. Get ahead
of me. An’ if you don’t keep moving, you’ll get a root
in that sweet little keister of yours.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I stumbled ignominiously through the trees towards
the distant, glaring eyes of the car. Hopelessness had
me by the throat, and an ache of self-pity. What had
I done to deserve this? Why had God picked on me
as a victim for these two unknown men? Now they
would be really angry. They would hurt me and later
almost certainly kill me. But the police would dig the
bullets out of me! What evil crime were they engaged
on that made them indifferent to the evidence of my
dead body? Whatever the crime was, they must be
quite confident that there would be no evidence.
Because there would be no me! They would bury me,
drop me in the lake with a stone round my neck!</p>

<p class="pindent">I came out through the fringe of the trees. The thin
man leaned out of the car and called to Sluggsy. ‘Okay.
Take her back. Don’t treat her rough. That’s for me.’
He put the car into reverse.</p>

<p class="pindent">Sluggsy came up beside me and his free hand fondled
me lasciviously. I just said, ‘Don’t.’ I had no will left
to resist.</p>

<p class="pindent">He said softly, ‘You’re in trouble, bimbo. Horror’s a
mean guy. He’ll hurt you bad. Now you say “Yes” to
me for tonight, and promise to act sweet, and mebbe
I can get the heat taken off. Howsabout it, baby?’</p>

<p class="pindent">I summoned a last ounce of fight. ‘I’d rather die
than have you touch me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Okay, sweetheart. So you won’t give, so I take for
myself. I reckon you’ve earned yourself a rough night.
Get me?’ He pinched me viciously so that I cried out.
Sluggsy laughed delightedly. ‘That’s right. Sing, baby!
Might as well get into practice.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He pushed me in through the open back door of
the lobby block and shut and locked it behind him.
The room looked just the same—the lights blazing,
the radio hammering out some gay dance tune, everything
winking and glittering and polished under the
light. I thought of how happy I had been in that room
only a few hours before, of the memories I had had
in that armchair, some of them sweet, some of them
sad. How small now my childish troubles seemed! How
ridiculous to talk of broken hearts and lost youth when,
just around the corner of my life, these men were
coming at me out of the darkness. The cinema in
Windsor? It was a small act in a play, almost a farce.
Zürich? It was paradise. The true jungle of the world,
with its real monsters, only rarely shows itself in the
life of a man, a girl, in the street. But it is always there.
You take a wrong step, play the wrong card in Fate’s
game, and you are in it and lost—lost in a world you
had never imagined, against which you have no knowledge
and no weapons. No compass.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man called Horror stood in the middle of the
room, idle, relaxed, his hands at his sides. He watched
me with those incurious eyes. Then he lifted his right
hand and crooked a finger. My cold, bruised feet walked
towards him. When I was only a few steps away from
him I came out of the trance. I suddenly remembered,
and my hand came up to the soaking waistband of
my pants and I felt the head of the ice-pick under the
apron. It was going to be difficult to get it out, to get
at the handle. I stopped in front of him. Still holding
my eyes, his right hand came up like a snake striking
and slapped me, biff-baff, right and left across my face.
The tears started from my eyes, but I remembered,
and ducked down as if to escape another blow. At the
same time, concealed in the movement, I got my right
hand down inside the band of my pants, and when I
came up I threw myself at him, hitting wildly towards
his head. The pick connected, but it was only a glancing
blow, and suddenly my arms were gripped from behind
and I was pulled back.</p>

<p class="pindent">Blood was oozing from a cut above the temple of
the grey face. As I watched, it trickled down towards
the chin. But the face was unmoved. It showed no
pain, only a terrifying intensity of purpose, and there
was a fleck of red deep inside the black eyes. The thin
man stepped up to me. My hand opened and the pick
fell to the floor with a clang. It was a reflex action—the
child dropping the weapon. I give up! I surrender!</p>

<p class="pindent">Pax!</p>

<p class="pindent">And then slowly, almost caressingly, he began to hit
me, now with his open hand, now with the fist,
choosing his targets with refined, erotic cruelty. At first
I twisted and bent and kicked, and then I began to
scream, while the grey face with the blood-streak and
the black holes for eyes watched, and the hands sprang
and sprang.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">I came to in the shower of my cabin. I was lying naked
on the tiles, the tattered, filthy remains of my pretty
clothes beside me. Sluggsy, chewing at a wooden toothpick,
leaned up against the wall with his hand on the
cold tap. His eyes were glistening slits. He turned off
the water and I somehow got to my knees. I knew I
was going to be sick. I didn’t care. I was a tamed,
whimpering animal ready to die. I retched.</p>

<p class="pindent">Sluggsy laughed. He leaned over and patted my
behind. ‘Go ahead, baby. First thing after a beat-up,
everyone vomits. Then clean yourself up nice and put
on a nice new outfit and come on over. Those eggs
got spoiled with you running off like that. No tricks!
Though I guess you ain’t got stomach for any more.
I’ll be watching the cabin from the back door. Now
don’t take on, baby. No blood. Hardly a bruise. Horror’s
got a nice touch with the dames. You’re sure lucky.
He’s a hippy guy. If he’d of been real mad, we’d be
digging a hole for you right now. Count your blessings,
baby. Be seein’ ya.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I heard the door of the cabin bang shut and then
my body took over.</p>

<p class="pindent">It took me half an hour to get myself into some
kind of shape, and again and again I just wanted to
throw myself on my bed and let the tears go on coming
until the men arrived with their guns to finish me off.
But the will to live came back into me with the familiar
movements of doing my hair and of getting my body,
sore and aching and weak with the memory of much
greater pain, to do what I wanted, and slowly into the
back of my mind there crept the possibility that I
might have been through the worst. If not, why was
I still alive? For some reason these men wanted me
there and not out of the way. Sluggsy was so good
with his gun that he could surely have killed me when
I made a run for it. His bullets had come close, but
hadn’t they been just to frighten, to make me stop?</p>

<p class="pindent">I put on my white overalls. Heaven knew they were
impersonal enough, and I put my money into one of
the pockets—just in case. Just in case of what? There
would be no more escapes. And then, feeling sore and
weak as a kitten, I dragged myself over to the lobby.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was eleven o’clock. The rain was still holding off
and a three-quarter moon sailed through fast, scudding
clouds, making the forest blink intermittently with
white light. Sluggsy was framed in the yellow entrance,
leaning against the door, chewing at his toothpick. As
I came up, he made way for me. ‘That’s my baby. Fresh
as paint. A little sore here and there, mebbe. Have to
sleep on your back later, huh? But that’s just what’ll
suit us, won’t it, honey?’</p>

<p class="pindent">When I didn’t answer, he reached out and caught
my arm. ‘Hey, hey! Where your manners, bimbo? You
like some treatment on the other side, mebbe? That
also can be arranged.’ He made a threatening gesture
with his free hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m sorry. I didn’t mean anything.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Okay, okay,’ he let me go. ‘Now just get on back
there and make with the pots and pans. An’ don’t go
getting my gauge up. Or my friend Horror’s. Look
what you done to that handsome kisser of his.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The thin man was sitting at his old table. The first-aid
box from the reception desk was open in front of
him and he had a big square of adhesive across his
right temple. I gave him a quick, frightened glance and
went behind the serving counter. Sluggsy went over
to him and sat down and they began talking together
in low voices, occasionally glancing across at me.</p>

<p class="pindent">Making the eggs and coffee made me feel hungry. I
couldn’t understand it. Ever since the two men had
got in through that door, I had been so tense and
frightened I couldn’t have swallowed even a cup of
coffee. Of course, I was empty from being sick, but
in a curious and, I felt, rather shameful way the beating
I had been given had in some mysterious fashion
relaxed me. The pain, being so much greater than the
tension of waiting for it, had unravelled my nerves
and there was a curious centre of warmth and peace
in my body. I was frightened still, of course—terrified,
but in a docile, fatalistic way. At the same time my
body said it was hungry, it wanted to get back its
strength, it wanted to live.</p>

<p class="pindent">So I made scrambled eggs and coffee and hot
buttered toast for myself as well, and, after I had taken
theirs over, I sat down out of sight of them behind
the counter and ate mine and then, almost calmly, lit
a cigarette. I knew the moment I lit it that it was a
foolish thing to do. It called attention to me. Worse,
it showed I had recovered, that I was worth baiting
again. But the food and the simple business of eating
it—of putting salt and pepper on the eggs, sugar into
the coffee—had been almost intoxicating. It was part
of the old life, a thousand years ago, before the men
came. Each mouthful—the forkful of egg, the bit of
bacon, the munch of buttery toast—was an exquisite
thing that occupied all my senses. Now I knew what
it must be like to get some food smuggled into jail, to
be a prisoner of war and get a parcel from home, to
find water in the desert, to be given a hot drink after
being rescued from drowning. The simple act of living,
how precious it was! If I got out of this, I would know
it for ever. I would be grateful for every breath I
breathed, every meal I ate, every night I felt the cool
kiss of sheets, the peace of a bed behind a closed, a
locked, door. Why had I never known this before?
Why had my parents, my lost religion, never taught it
to me? Anyway, I knew now. I had found it out for
myself. Love of life is born of the awareness of death,
of the dread of it. Nothing makes one really grateful
for life except the black wings of danger.</p>

<p class="pindent">These feverish thoughts were born of the intoxication
of the food and of eating it alone behind the
barricade of the counter. For a few moments I was
back in the old life. So, light-heartedly, and to hug the
moment to me, I lit the cigarette.</p>

<p class="pindent">Perhaps a minute later, the mumble of the voices
died. Behind ‘Tales of the Vienna Woods’ coming
softly from the radio, I heard a chair being drawn back.
Now I felt panic. I put out the cigarette in the dregs
of my coffee and got up and began briskly turning
taps and clattering the dishes in the metal sink. I didn’t
look, but I could see Sluggsy coming across the room.
He came up to the counter and leaned on it. I looked
up as if surprised. He was still chewing away at a
toothpick, flicking it from side to side of his thick-lipped,
oval mouth. He had a box of Kleenex that he
put on the counter. He wrenched out a handful of
tissues and blew his nose and dropped the tissues on
the floor. He said in an amiable voice, ‘Ya gone an’
given me a catarrh, bimbo. All that chasing aroun’ in
the woods. This trouble of mine, this alopecia thing
that kills the hair. You know what that does? That kills
the hairs inside the nose too. Together with all the rest.
An’ you know what that does? That makes your
schnozzle dribble bad when you got a cold. You given
me a cold, bimbo. That means a box of wipes every
twenty-four hours. More, mebbe. Ya ever think of
that? Ya ever think of people have no hairs in their
snouts? Aargh!’ The hairless eyes were suddenly hard
with anger. ‘You gashes are all the same. Just think of
yerselves. To hell with the guys that got troubles! You
just go for the good-timers.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I said quietly, under the noise of the radio, ‘I’m sorry
for your troubles. Why aren’t you sorry for mine?’ I
spoke quickly, forcefully. ‘Why do you two come here
and knock me about? What have I done to you? Why
don’t you let me go? If you do I promise I won’t say
a word to anyone. I’ve got a little money. I could give
you some of it. Say two hundred dollars. I can’t afford
any more. I’ve got to get all the way down to Florida
on the rest. Please, won’t you let me go?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Sluggsy let out a hoot of laughter. He turned and
called across to the thin man, ‘Hey, get out the crying
towel, Horror. The slot says she’ll hand over two Cs
if we let her scram.’ The thin man gave a slight shrug
of the shoulders, but made no comment. Sluggsy
turned back to me. His eyes were hard and without
mercy. He said, ‘Wise up, bimbo. You’re in the act, and
you’ve been given a star part to play. You ought to be
tickled to be of so much interest to busy, important
guys like Horror and me, and to a big wheel like Mr
Sanguinetti.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What is the act? What do you want me for?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Sluggsy said indifferently, ‘You’ll be wised up come
morning. Meanwhiles, howsabout shuttin’ that dumb
little hashtrap of yours? All this yak is bending my ear.
I want some action. That’s sweet stuff they’re playing.
Howsabout you an’ me stepping it together? Put on a
little show for Horror. Then we’ll be off to the hay
and make with the bodies. C’mon, chick.’ He held out
his arms, clicking his fingers to the music and doing
some fast steps.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m sorry. I’m tired.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Sluggsy came back to the counter. He said angrily,
‘You’ve got a big keister giving me that crap. Cheap
little hustler! I’ll give you something to make you
tired.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly there was an obscene little black leather
cosh in his hand. He brought it down with a dull whack
on the counter. It left a deep dent in the formica. He
began to move stealthily round the edge of the counter,
humming to himself, his eyes holding mine. I backed
up into the far corner. This was going to be my last
gesture. Somehow I must hurt him back before I went
under. My hand felt for the open cutlery drawer and
suddenly I dipped in and flung, all in one motion. His
duck wasn’t quick enough, and the silver spray of
knives and forks burst round his head. He put a hand
up to his face and backed away, cursing. I hurled some
more and then some more, but they only clattered
inoffensively round his hunched head. Now the thin
man was moving fast across the room. I grabbed the
carving knife and made a dash for Sluggsy, but he saw
me coming and dodged behind a table. Unhurriedly,
Horror took off his coat and wrapped it round his left
arm, then they both picked up chairs and, holding the
legs out like bulls’ horns, they charged me from both
sides. I made one ineffectual slash at an arm, and then
the knife was knocked out of my hand and all I could
do was to get back behind the counter.</p>

<p class="pindent">Still holding the chair, Sluggsy came in after me and,
while I stood facing him, with a plate in each hand,
the thin man leant swiftly across the counter and got
hold of my hair. I hurled the plates sideways, but they
only clattered away across the floor. And then my head
was being bent down on to the counter top and Sluggsy
was on me.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Okay, Horror. Let her go. This is for me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I felt his powerful arms round me, crushing me, and
his face was against mine, kissing me brutally, while
his hand went up to the zip at my neck and tore it
right down to my waist.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then came the sharp sound of the buzzer at
the front door, and everyone froze.</p>
