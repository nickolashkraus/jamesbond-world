<p class="pindent">‘Kerist, whassat?’ Sluggsy had backed away and his
hand was inside his leather jacket.</p>

<p class="pindent">Horror recovered himself first. There was a cold
snarl on his face. ‘Git over behind the door, Sluggsy.
Hold your fire until I tell you. You,’ he spat the words
at me, ‘get yourself into shape. You’ve got to front
for us. If you don’t do it good you’re dead. Understand?
You’ll be shot. Now get over to that door and find
out who it is. Tell ’em the same story you told us. Get
me? And take that silly expression off your face. No
one’s going to hurt you if you do what I say. Pull that
zip up, dammit!’ I was struggling with the thing. It was
stuck. ‘Well, hold the damn thing together across your
chest and get moving. I’ll be right behind you. And
don’t forget, one wrong word and you get blasted
through the back. And the guy, too. Now scram over
there.’</p>

<p class="pindent">My heart was beating wildly. Somehow, whatever
happened, I was going to save myself!</p>

<p class="pindent">There was now a loud knocking at the door. I went
slowly over, holding the top half of my overalls
together. I knew the first thing I had to do!</p>

<p class="pindent">When I got to the door, Sluggsy leaned sideways
and unlocked it. Now everything depended on the
speed of my hands. I took hold of the door handle
with my left hand and, as I turned it, my right hand
let go of the overalls and dived down to the chain and
unhooked it. Somebody cursed softly behind me and
I felt the prod of a gun in my back, but then I had
swung the door wide open, crashing Sluggsy against
the wall behind it. I had gambled that, without knowing
if it was perhaps the police or a road patrol, they
wouldn’t shoot. They hadn’t. Now all depended on the
solitary man who stood on the threshold.</p>

<p class="pindent">At first glance I inwardly groaned—God, it’s another
of them! He stood there so quiet and controlled and
somehow with the same quality of deadliness as the
others. And he wore that uniform that the films make
one associate with gangsters—a dark-blue, belted raincoat
and a soft black hat pulled rather far down. He
was good-looking in a dark, rather cruel way and a
scar showed whitely down his left cheek. I quickly put
my hand up to hide my nakedness. Then he smiled
and suddenly I thought I might be all right.</p>

<p class="pindent">When he spoke, my heart leaped. He was English!
‘I’m sorry. I’ve got a puncture.’ (An American would
have said ‘a flat’.) ‘And I saw the Vacancy sign. Can I
have a room for the night?’ Now he looked at me with
curiosity, seeing that something was wrong.</p>

<p class="pindent">This was going to be tricky! I might easily get us
both killed. I said, ‘I’m sorry, but the motel’s closed.
The Vacancy sign was on by mistake.’ While I said this,
I crooked the index finger of the hand at my chest,
inviting him in. He looked puzzled. I had to give him
a lead. ‘Is the puncture so bad that you can’t get as far
as Lake George?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Couldn’t possibly. I’ve already come a mile on the
rim. The cover’ll be gone by now.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I imperceptibly jerked my head backwards, bidding
him to come in. ‘Well, the insurance men are here from
the owner. I’ll have to ask them. You wait there.’ Again
I beckoned with my finger. Then I turned and took
two steps inside, keeping close to the door so that
neither of them could bang it shut. But they were
standing back, hands in their pockets, looking different
kinds of hell at me. The man in the raincoat had taken
my hint and he was now well inside. When he saw the
two men, his face somehow sharpened, but he said
casually, ‘I expect you heard all that. Any objection to
my spending the night here?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Sluggsy said contemptuously, ‘Kerist! A limey! What
is this, the United Nations?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The thin man said curtly, ‘No dice, friend. You heard
the lady. The motel’s closed. We’ll give you a hand
changing the wheel and you can be on your way.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Englishman said easily, ‘It’s a bit late at night for
that. I’m heading south and I doubt if there’s anything
on this road this side of Glens Falls. I think I’d prefer
to stay here. After all, the Vacancy sign’s on.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You heard me, mister.’ Horror’s voice was now
tough. He turned to Sluggsy. ‘C’mon. We’ll give the
guy a hand with his flat.’ They both took a step towards
the door. But the Englishman, bless him, stood his
ground.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It happens that I have friends at Albany, quite
important friends. You wouldn’t want to lose your
motel operator’s licence, would you? The sign said
“Vacancy”, and the place is lit up. I’m tired and I claim
a room.’ He turned to me. ‘Would that give you any
trouble?’</p>

<p class="pindent">I gushed, ‘Oh, no! None at all. It won’t take me a
minute to get a room ready. I’m sure Mr Sanguinetti
wouldn’t want to do anything to lose his licence?’ I
turned wide-eyed and innocent towards the two
gangsters. They looked as if they were just about to
pull their guns, but the thin man moved away and
Sluggsy followed him and they talked for a moment
in whispers. I took the opportunity to nod urgently
and appealingly at the Englishman and he gave me
another of those reassuring smiles.</p>

<p class="pindent">The thin man turned round. ‘Okay, limey. You can
have the room. But just don’t try and lean on us with
that Albany guff. Mr Sanguinetti has friends at the
capital, too. Mebbe you got a point with that Vacancy
sign. But don’t push your luck. We’re in charge here
and what we says goes. Right?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s all right with me. And thanks. I’ll get my
bag.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He moved to go out. I said quickly, ‘I’ll give you a
hand.’ I hurried ahead of him, tugging furiously at my
zip, feeling ashamed of how I must have looked. Blessedly,
it suddenly yielded and I pulled it up to my
throat.</p>

<p class="pindent">He came up with me. I said urgently, out of the
corner of my mouth—I was sure one of them had
come to the door and was watching us—‘Thank you!
And thank God you came! They were going to murder
me. But for God’s sake look out. They’re gangsters. I
don’t know what they want. It must be something bad.
They shot at me when I tried to escape.’</p>

<p class="pindent">We came to the car. It was a dark grey two-seater
Thunderbird with a soft top in cream, a beautiful thing.
I said so. He said shortly that it was hired. He said,
‘Come round the other side. Just seem to be admiring
the car.’ He leaned down and opened the low door
and rummaged inside. He said, ‘Are they both
armed?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How many guns each?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t know. The small one’s a crack shot. At twenty
feet or so. Don’t know about the other.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He pulled out a small black suitcase, rested it on the
ground and snapped it open. He took something from
under the clothes and slipped it into an inside pocket.
He fiddled with one side of the case, took some thin
black objects out that I took to be cartridge magazines,
and stowed them away. Then he snapped the case shut,
said, ‘Better have plenty of artillery,’ banged the door
ostentatiously, and stood up. We then both went to
the back of the car and knelt down to examine the
flat tyre. He said, ‘How about the telephone?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s cut off.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Give me the cabin next to yours.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right. Let’s go. And keep close to me whatever
they do or say.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, and thank you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He got up and smiled. ‘Wait till we’re out of this.’</p>

<p class="pindent">We walked back together. Sluggsy, who had been
standing in the doorway, shut the door after us and
locked it. As an afterthought, he reached up and
switched off the Vacancy sign. He said, ‘Here’s your
key, limey,’ and threw it on a table.</p>

<p class="pindent">I picked it up and looked at the number. Forty, the
last one along to the left. I said firmly, ‘The gentleman’s
going to have Number 10, next to mine,’ and walked
over to the desk, forgetting that Sluggsy had all the
other keys.</p>

<p class="pindent">Sluggsy had followed me. He grinned. ‘No dice,
baby. We don’t know nuthen about this guy. So Horror
and me’s sleepin’ either side of you. Just to see you’re
not disturbed. Rest of the keys is put away ready for
the move. There’s just this Number 40 and nuthen
else.’ He turned to the Englishman. ‘Hey, limey. What’s
your name?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Bond. James Bond.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s a pretty chump name. From England,
huh?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s right. Where’s the registry? I’ll spell it out for
you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Wise guy, huh? What’s your line of business?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Police.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Sluggsy’s mouth opened. He ran his tongue over his
lips. He turned and called over to Horror, who was
sitting at his old table, ‘Hey, Horror. Guess what! This
shamus is a limey dick! Whadya know about that? A
gum-shoe!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Horror nodded. ‘Thought I smelled it. Who cares?
We ain’t done nuthin’ wrong.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yeh,’ said Sluggsy eagerly, ‘that’s right too.’ He
turned to this Mr Bond. ‘Now don’t you go listening
to any crap from this little hustler. We’re from the
insurance, see. Assessors, sort of. Work for Mr
Sanguinetti. He’s a big wheel in Troy. Owns this outfit.
Well, there’d been complaints from the managers of
some cash missing. Other things too. So we come up
to make an investigation, sort of, and when we put
the question to this little tramp she slams my friend
with an ice-pick bang on the think-pot. See for yourself.’
He waved in the direction of Horror. ‘Now how
d’ya like that? So we was just restraining her, sort of,
when you comes along.’ He turned. ‘Ain’t that right,
Horror?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s on the level. That’s how it was.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I said angrily, ‘You know that’s a pack of lies.’ I
walked over to the back door and pointed at the bent
frame and the splash of lead. ‘How did that bullet hole
get there?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Sluggsy laughed heartily. ‘Search me, sister.’ He
turned to Horror. ‘You seen any bullets flyin’
around?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No, I ain’t.’ Horror’s voice was bored. He waved a
languid hand towards the floor round the eating
counter. ‘But I seen plenty hardware being slung at my
pal by the lady.’ His eyes swivelled slowly to me. ‘That
right, lady? An’ there’s a big carving knife down there
somewhere. Good mind to book you for assault, come
the morning.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You do that!’ I said hotly. ‘Just see where it’ll get
you! You know perfectly well I was trying to defend
myself. And as for that story about the money, that’s
the first I’ve heard of it. And you know it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Englishman broke in quietly. ‘Well, it seems I
came along at the right time to keep the peace. Now,
where’s that registry so that I can sign it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Sluggsy said curtly, ‘Register’s with de boss. No
purpose in signin’ nuthen. You ain’t payin’. The place
is closed. You can have your bed on the house.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, thanks. That’s very kind of you.’ James Bond
turned to me. ‘Any chance of some eggs and bacon
and coffee? All this talking’s made me hungry. I can
cook it myself if the stuff’s there.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, no.’ I almost ran behind the counter. ‘I’d love
to do it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thank you very much.’ He turned his back on
Sluggsy and sauntered over to the counter and hoisted
himself on to a stool, putting his case on the next
one.</p>

<p class="pindent">Out of the corner of my eye I watched Sluggsy turn
on his heel and walk quickly over to the thin man and
sit down and begin talking urgently.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond glanced over his shoulder at them and
then got down off his stool and took off his raincoat
and hat and put them on top of his case and climbed
back. He silently watched the men in the long mirror
at the back of the counter while I busied myself with
the cooking things and took him in with quick
glances.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was about six feet tall, slim and fit-looking. The
eyes in the lean, slightly tanned face were a very clear
grey-blue and as they observed the men they were cold
and watchful. The narrowed, watchful eyes gave his
good looks the dangerous, almost cruel quality that
had frightened me when I had first set eyes on him,
but now that I knew how he could smile, I thought
his face only exciting, in a way that no man’s face had
ever excited me before. He wore a soft-looking white
silk shirt with a thin black knitted tie that hung down
loosely without a pin, and his single-breasted suit was
made of some dark blue lightweight material that may
have been alpaca. The strong, rather good hands lay
quietly on his crossed arms on the counter, and now
he reached down to his hip pocket and took out a
wide, thin gun-metal cigarette case and opened it.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Have one? Senior Service. I suppose it’ll have to be
Chesterfields from now on.’ His mouth turned slightly
down as he smiled.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No, thanks. Not now. After I’ve done the
cooking.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘By the way, what’s your name? You’re Canadian
aren’t you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, from Quebec. But I’ve been in England the
last five years or so. I’m Vivienne Michel. My friends
call me Viv.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How in God’s name did you manage to get into
this fix? Those are a couple of the toughest hoodlums
I’ve seen in years. And Troy’s a bad town—sort of a
gangster suburb to Albany. The thin one’s just finished
a long stretch in jail, or I’ll eat my hat. The other looks
like the worst kind of psycho. How did it happen?’</p>

<p class="pindent">I told him, in short bursts between the cooking, and
cutting out all but the essentials. He listened quietly
and without comment. Music was still coming from
the radio, but the two gangsters were sitting silently
watching us so I kept my voice low. When I had
finished, I said, ‘But is it true that you’re a
policeman?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not quite. But I’m in that sort of business.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You mean a detective?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, sort of.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I knew it!’</p>

<p class="pindent">He laughed. ‘How?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, I don’t know. But you look, kind of, kind of
dangerous. And that was a gun you took out of your
bag, and ammunition. Are you’—I was embarrassed,
but I needed to know—‘are you official? I mean from
the Government?’</p>

<p class="pindent">He smiled reassuringly. ‘Oh, yes. Don’t worry about
that. And they know me in Washington. If we get out
of this all right, I’m going to go after those two.’ His
eyes were cold again. ‘I’m going to see they get roasted
for what they did to you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You believe me?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course. Every word. But what I can’t make out
is what they’re up to. They seem to have acted as if
they knew they were safe to do anything they liked
with you. And now they seem quite calm about me
having got into the act. I don’t like it. Have they had
any drinks? Do they smoke?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No. Neither of them.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I don’t like that either. It’s only pros that don’t.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I had finished cooking his supper and I put it up
on the counter. He ate as if he was really hungry. I
asked him if it was all right. He said it was wonderful
and I felt warm inside. What a fantastic bit of luck
this man, and just this man, coming so magically out
of the blue! I felt humble about it. It was so much a
miracle. I swore to myself to say my prayers that night,
the first time for years. I hovered about him slavishly,
offering him more coffee, some jam to finish his toast
with. Finally he laughed tenderly at me, ‘You’re spoiling
me. Here, I’m sorry. I forgot all about it. It’s time for
your cigarette. You’ve earned the whole caseful.’ He
lit it with a Ronson, gun-metalled like his case. My
hand touched his and I felt a small shock pass down
my body. I suddenly found I was trembling. I quickly
took the dishes and began washing them. I said, ‘I
haven’t earned anything. It’s so wonderful you’re here.
It’s an absolute miracle.’ My voice choked and I felt
stupid tears coming. I brushed the back of my hand
across my eyes. He must have seen, but he pretended
not to have.</p>

<p class="pindent">Instead he said cheerfully, ‘Yes. It was a stroke of
luck. At least I hope so. Can’t count the chickens yet.
Tell you what. We’ve got to sit these two hoodlums
out. Wait until they make a move, go to bed or something.
Would you like to hear just how I came to turn
up tonight? It’ll all be in the papers in a day or two.
The story. Only I won’t be mentioned. So you must
promise to forget my side of the thing. It’s all nonsense,
really. These regulations. But I have to work under
them. All right? It might take your mind off your
troubles. They seem to have been pretty powerful
ones.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I said gratefully, ‘Yes, please tell me. And I promise.
Cross my heart.’</p>
