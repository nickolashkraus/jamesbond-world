<p class="pindent">My heart went to my mouth. Who could it possibly
be? And then I remembered. The Vacancy sign! I had
pulled the switch when the lightning struck and I had
forgotten to turn the damned thing off. What an idiot!
The banging started up again. Well, I would just have
to face it, apologize, and send the people on to Lake
George. I went nervously across to the door, unlocked
it, and held it on the chain.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was no porch. The neon Vacancy sign made
a red halo in the sheet of rain and glittered redly on
the shiny black oilskins and hoods of the two men.
Behind them was a black sedan. The leading man said
politely, ‘Miss Michel?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, that’s me. But I’m afraid the Vacancy sign’s on
by mistake. The motel’s closed down.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sure, sure. We’re from Mr Sanguinetti. From his
insurance company. Come to make a quick inventory
before things get taken away tomorrow. Can we come
in out of the rain, miss? Show you our credentials
inside. Sure is a terrible night.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I looked doubtfully from one to the other, but I
could see little of the faces under the oilskin hoods.
It sounded all right, but I didn’t like it. I said nervously,
‘But the Phanceys, the managers, they didn’t say
anything about you coming.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well they should of, miss. I’ll havta report that back
to Mr Sanguinetti.’ He turned to the man behind him.
‘That right, Mister Jones?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The other man stifled a giggle. Why did he giggle?
‘Sure, that’s right, Mister Thomson.’ He giggled
again.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Okay then, miss. Can we come inside, please? It
sure is wetter’n hell out here.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, I don’t know. I was told not to let anyone in.
But as it’s from Mr Sanguinetti . . .’ I nervously undid
the chain and opened the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">They pushed in, shouldering roughly past me, and
stood side by side looking the big room over. The
man who had been addressed as ‘Mr Thomson’ sniffed.
Black eyes looked at me out of a cold, grey face. ‘You
smoke?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, a little. Why?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Reckoned you could have company.’ He took the
door handle from me, slammed the door, locked it,
and put up the chain. The two men stripped off their
dripping oilskins and threw them messily down on
the floor and, now that I could see them both, I felt
in extreme danger.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mr Thomson’, obviously the leader, was tall and
thin, almost skeletal, and his skin had this grey,
drowned look as if he always lived indoors. The black
eyes were slow-moving, incurious, and the lips thin
and purplish like an unstitched wound. When he spoke
there was a glint of grey silvery metal from his front
teeth and I supposed they had been cheaply capped
with steel, as I had heard was done in Russia and
Japan. The ears lay very flat and close to the bony,
rather box-shaped head and the stiff, greyish-black
hair was cut so close to the skull that the skin showed
whitely through it. He was wearing a black, sharp-looking
single-breasted coat with shoulders padded
square, stovepipe trousers so narrow that the bones
of his knees bulged through the material, and a grey
shirt buttoned up to the throat with no tie. His shoes
were pointed in the Italian style and of grey suede.
They and the clothes looked new. He was a frightening
lizard of a man, and my skin crawled with fear of
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Where this man was deadly, the other was merely
unpleasant—a short, moon-faced youth with wet, very
pale blue eyes and fat wet lips. His skin was very white
and he had that hideous disease of no hair—no
eyebrows and no eyelashes, and none on a head that
was as polished as a billiard ball. I would have felt
sorry for him if I hadn’t been so frightened, particularly
as he seemed to have a bad cold and began
blowing his nose as soon as he got his oilskins off.
Under them he wore a black leather windcheater,
grubby trousers and those Mexican saddle-leather
boots with straps that they wear in Texas. He looked
a young monster, the sort that pulls wings off flies,
and I desperately wished that I had dressed in clothes
that didn’t make me seem so terribly naked.</p>

<p class="pindent">Sure enough, he now finished blowing his nose and
seemed to take me in for the first time. He looked
me over, grinning delightedly. Then he walked all
round me and came back and gave a long, low whistle.
‘Say, Horror,’ he winked at the other man. ‘This is
some bimbo! Git an eyeful of those knockers! And a
rear-end to match! Geez, what a dish!’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not now, Sluggsy. Later. Git goin’ and look those
cabins over. Meantime, the lady’s goin’ to fix us some
chow. How you want your eggs?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The man called Sluggsy grinned at me. ‘Scramble
’em, baby. And nice and wet. Like mother makes.
Otherwise poppa spank. Right across that sweet little
biscuit of yours. Oh boy, oh boy!’ He did some little
dancing, boxing steps towards me and I backed away
to the door. I pretended to be even more frightened
than I was, and when he got within range I slapped
him as hard as I could across the face and, before he
could recover from his surprise, I had darted sideways
behind a table and picked up one of the little metal
chairs and held it with the feet pointing at him.</p>

<p class="pindent">The thin man gave a short, barking laugh. ‘Ixnay,
Sluggsy. I said later. Leave the stupid slot be. There’s
all night for that. Git goin’ like I said.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The eyes in the pale moon-face were now red with
excitement. The man rubbed his cheek. The wet lips
parted in a slow smile. ‘You know what, baby? You
just earned yourself one whale of a night. An’ it’s
goin’ to be long and slow an’ again and again. Get
me?’</p>

<p class="pindent">I looked at them both from behind the raised chair.
Inside I was whimpering. These men were dynamite
from Nightmare-land. Somehow I kept my voice
steady. ‘Who are you? What’s this all about? Let’s see
those credentials. The next car that comes by, I’ll break
a window and get help. I’m from Canada. You do
anything to me and you’ll be in bad trouble
tomorrow.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Sluggsy laughed. ‘Tomorrow’s tomorrow. What you
got to worry about’s tonight, baby.’ He turned to the
thin man. ‘Mebbe you better wise her up, Horror.
Then mebbe we’ll get some co-operation.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Horror looked across at me. His expression was
cold, uninterested. ‘Ya shouldn’t of hit Sluggsy, lady.
The boy’s tough. He don’t like the dames not to go
for him. Thinks it may be on account of his kisser.
Been like that since he done a spell in solitary at San
Q. Nervous sickness. What’s that the docs call it,
Sluggsy?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Sluggsy looked proud. He brought the Latin words
out carefully. ‘<span class="it">Alopecia totalis.</span> That means no hair, see?
Not a one.’ He gestured at his body. ‘Not here, or
here, or here. What d’ya know about that, eh,
bimbo?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Horror continued. ‘So Sluggsy gets mad easy. Thinks
he ain’t had a fair deal from society. You had that puss
of his, mebbe you’d be the same. So he’s what we call
in Troy an enforcer. Guys hire him to make other
guys do what they want, if you get me. He’s on Mr
Sanguinetti’s roll, and Mr Sanguinetti thought he and
I better come along and keep an eye on this joint till
the truckers come. Mr Sanguinetti didn’t care for a
young lady like you bein’ all alone here at night.
So he sent us along for company. Ain’t that so,
Sluggsy?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s the spiel. Sure is,’ he giggled. ‘Just to keep
you company, bimbo. Keep the wolves away. With
them statistics of yours, there must be times when
you need protection real bad. Right?’</p>

<p class="pindent">I lowered the chair on to the table top. ‘Well, what
are your names? What about these credentials?’</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a single tin of Maxwell House coffee on
the shelf above the bar counter, all by itself. Sluggsy
suddenly swivelled and his right hand—I hadn’t even
seen him draw a gun—shot flame. There was the
crash of gunfire. The tin jumped sideways and then
fell. In mid-air Sluggsy hit it again and there was a
brown explosion of coffee. Then a deafening silence
in which the last empty shell tinkled away on the floor.
Sluggsy turned back to me. His hands were empty.
The gun had gone. His eyes were dreamy with pleasure
at his marksmanship. He said softly, ‘How’s them for
credentials, baby?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The small cloud of blue smoke had reached me,
and I smelled the cordite. My legs were trembling. I
said, scornfully I hope, ‘That’s a lot of wasted coffee.
Now, what about your names?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The thin man said, ‘The lady’s right. You didn’t
ought to of spilled that java, Sluggsy. But ya see, lady,
that’s why they call him Sluggsy, on account he’s smart
with the hardware. Sluggsy Morant. Me, I’m Sol
Horowitz. They call me “Horror”. Can’t say why. Kin
you, Sluggsy?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Sluggsy giggled. ‘Mebbe one time you gave some
guy a scare, Horror. Mebbe a whole bunch of guys.
Leastwise that’s what they tell me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Horror made no comment. He said quietly, ‘Okay.
Let’s go! Sluggsy, see to the cabins like I said. Lady,
you make us some chow. Keep ya nose clean and cooperate
and ya won’t get hurt. Okay?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Sluggsy looked me over greedily. He said, ‘Not
much, that is. Eh, bimbo?’ and walked over to the key
rack behind the desk and took down all the keys and
let himself out through the back entrance. I put down
the chair, and, as coolly as I knew how, but painfully
aware of my toreador pants, walked across the room
and went behind the counter.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man called Horror sauntered slowly over to
the cafeteria table farthest from me. He pulled a chair
away from the table, twisted it in his hand and pushed
it between his legs. He sat down and leaned his folded
arms along the back and rested his chin on them and
watched me with unwavering, indifferent eyes. He said
softly, so softly that I could only just hear him, ‘I’ll
take mine scrambled too, lady. Plenty crisp bacon.
Buttered toast. Howsabout coffee?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ll see what’s left.’ I got down on my hands and
knees behind the bar. The tin had four holes right
through it. There was about an inch of coffee left and
a whole lot scattered over the floor. I put the tin aside
and scraped what I could from the floor on to a plate,
not caring how much dust went with it. The unspoiled
remains of the tin I would keep for myself.</p>

<p class="pindent">I spent about five minutes down there, taking my
time, desperately trying to think, to plan. These men
were gangsters. They worked for this Mr Sanguinetti.
That seemed certain because they had got my name
from him or from the Phanceys. The rest of their
story was lies. They had been sent up here, through
the storm, for a purpose. What was it? They knew I
was a Canadian, a foreigner, and that I could easily
go to the police the next day and get them into
trouble. The man called Sluggsy had been in San
Quentin. And the other? Of course! That was why
he looked grey and sort of dead! He had probably
just come out of prison, too. He smelled of it,
somehow. So I could get them into real trouble, tell
the police that I was a journalist, that I was going to
write up what happened to girls alone in the States.
But would I be believed? That Vacancy sign! I was
alone in the place, yet I had left it on. Wasn’t that
because I wanted company? Why had I dressed up
like that, to kill, if I had expected to be alone? I
dodged away from that line of thought. But, to get
back. What did these two men want here? They had
an ordinary car. If they had wanted to clean the place
out, they would have brought a truck. Perhaps they
really had been sent up to guard the place, and they
just treated me as they did because that was the way
gangsters behaved. But how much worse were they
going to get? What was going to happen to me
tonight?</p>

<p class="pindent">I got to my feet and began to busy myself with the
cooking. Better give them what they wanted. There
must be no excuse for them to set on me.</p>

<p class="pindent">Jed’s apron was rolled up and thrown into a corner.
I picked it up and put it round my waist. A weapon?
There was an ice-pick in the cutlery drawer and a long,
very sharp carving knife. I took the pick and stuck it
handle first down the front of my pants under the
apron. The knife I hid under a dishcloth beside the
sink. I left the cutlery drawer open and lined up beside
it a row of glasses and cups for throwing. Childish?
It was all I had.</p>

<p class="pindent">Every now and then I glanced across the room.
Always the thin man’s eyes were on me, old in crime
and its countermoves, knowing what was in my mind,
what defences I was preparing. I sensed this, but I
went on with my little preparations, thinking, as I had
at the English school, ‘When they hurt me, and I
know they’re meaning to hurt me, I must somehow
hurt them back. When they get me, rape me, kill me,
they mustn’t find it easy.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Rape? Kill? What did I think was really going to
happen to me? I didn’t know. I only knew that I was
in desperate trouble. The men’s faces said so—the
indifferent face and the greedy face. They both had
it in for me. Why? I didn’t know. But I was absolutely
certain of it.</p>

<p class="pindent">I had broken eight eggs into a bowl and had
whipped them gently with a fork. The huge chunk of
butter had melted in the saucepan. Beside it, in the
frying pan, the bacon was beginning to sizzle. I poured
the eggs into the saucepan and began to stir. While
my hands concentrated, my mind was busy on ways
to escape. Everything depended on whether the man
called Sluggsy, when he came back from his inspection,
remembered to lock the back door. If he didn’t,
I could make a dash for it. There would be no question
of using the Vespa. I hadn’t run it for a week.
Priming the carburettor, and the three kicks that might
be necessary to start it from cold, would be too long.
I would have to leave my belongings, all my precious
money, and just go like a hare to right or left, get
round the end of the cabins and in among the trees.
I reflected that of course I wouldn’t run to the right.
The lake behind the cabins would narrow my escape
route. I would run to the left. There, there was nothing
but miles of trees. I would be soaked to the skin
within a few yards of the door, and freezing cold for
the rest of the night. My feet, in their stupid little
sandals, would be cut to ribbons. I might easily get
lost into the bargain. But those were problems I would
have to cope with. The main thing was to get away
from these men. Nothing else mattered.</p>

<p class="pindent">The eggs were ready and I heaped them out, still
very soft, on to a flat dish and added the bacon round
the sides. I put the pile of toast from the Toastmaster
on another plate, together with a slab of butter still
in its paper, and put the whole lot on a tray. I was
glad to see that plenty of dust rose to the top when
I poured boiling water over the coffee, and I hoped
it would choke them. Then I carried the tray out from
behind the bar and, feeling more respectable in my
apron, took it over to where the thin man was
sitting.</p>

<p class="pindent">As I put it down, I heard the back door open and
then slam shut. There had been no click of a lock. I
looked quickly round. Sluggsy’s hands were empty.
My heart began to beat wildly. Sluggsy came over to
the table. I was taking things off the tray. He looked
the meal over and came swiftly behind me and seized
me round the waist, nuzzling his ghastly face into my
neck. ‘Just like mother made ’em, baby. Howsabout
you and me shacking up together? If you can —— like
you can cook, you’re the gal of my dreams. What say,
bimbo? Is it a deal?’</p>

<p class="pindent">I had my hand on the coffee pot and he was just
going to get the boiling contents slung over my
shoulder. Horror saw my intention. He said sharply,
‘Leave her be, Sluggsy. I said later.’ The words came
out like a whiplash, and at once Sluggsy let me go.
The thin man said, ‘Ya nearly got ya eyeballs fried. Ya
want to watch this dame. Quit foolin’ around and sit
down. We’re on a job.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Sluggsy’s face showed bravado, but also obedience.
‘Have a heart, pal! I want a piece of this baby. But
now!’ But he pulled out a chair and sat down, and I
moved quickly away.</p>

<p class="pindent">The big radio and TV was on a pedestal near the
back door. It had been playing softly all this time,
although I had been quite unconscious of it. I went
to the machine and fiddled with the dials, putting the
volume up. The two men were talking to each other
quietly and there was the clatter of cutlery. Now or
never! I measured my distance to the door handle and
dived to the left.</p>
