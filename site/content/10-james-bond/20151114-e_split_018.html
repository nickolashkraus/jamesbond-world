<h2 id="calibre_toc_18" class="calibre8"><a id="Page_153" class="calibre9"></a>13. The Crash of Guns</h2>

<p class="pindent">‘I <span class="it">was</span>.’ ‘Say who I <span class="it">was</span> . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">Why did he have to say such a thing, put the idea
into the mind of God, of Fate, of whoever was
controlling tonight? One should never send out black
thoughts. They live on, like sound-waves, and get into
the stream of consciousness in which we all swim.
If God, Fate, happened to be listening in, at that
moment, on that particular wave-length, it might be
made to happen. The hint of a death-thought might
be misunderstood. It might be read as a request!</p>

<p class="pindent">So I mustn’t think these thoughts either, or I would
be adding my weight to the dark waves of destiny!
What nonsense! I had learned this sort of stuff from
Kurt. He had always been full of ‘cosmic chain
reactions’, ‘cryptograms of the lifeforce’ and other
Germanic magical double-talk that I had avidly lapped
up as if, as he had sometimes hinted, he himself had
been the ‘Central Dynamic’, or at least part of it, who
controlled all these things.</p>

<p class="pindent">Of course James Bond had said that flippantly, in a
cross-my-fingers way, like the skiers I had known in
Europe who said ‘<span class="it">Hals und Beinbruch!</span>’ to their friends
before they took off on the slalom or the downhill
race. To wish them ‘Break your neck and your leg’
before the off was to avert accidents, to invoke the
opposite of the evil eye. James Bond was just being
‘British’—using a throwaway phrase to buck me up.
Well, I wished he hadn’t. The crash of guns, gangsters,
attempted murders, were part of his job, his life. They
weren’t part of mine, and I blamed him for not being
more sensitive, more human.</p>

<p class="pindent">Where was he now? Working his way through the
shadows, using the light of the flames as cover,
pricking up his senses for danger? And what were
the enemy doing? Those two pro gangsters he was
too quick to despise? Were they waiting for him in
ambush? Would there suddenly be a roar of gunfire?
Then screams?</p>

<p class="pindent">I got to the car-port of Number 3 cabin and,
brushing along the rough-cast stone wall, felt my way
through the darkness. I cautiously inched the last few
feet and looked round the corner towards the dancing
flames and shadows of the other cabins and of the
lobby block.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was no one to be seen, no movement except
the flames at which the wind tugged intermittently
to keep the blaze alive. Now some of the bordering
trees behind the cabins were almost catching and
sparks were blowing from their drying branches away
into the darkness. If it hadn’t been for the storm,
surely a forest fire would have been started and then
the coshed girl with her broken lamp would indeed
have left her mark on the United States of America!
How far would it have gone with the wind to help
it? Ten miles? Twenty? How many trees and birds
and animals would the little dead girl from Quebec
have destroyed?</p>

<p class="pindent">Another cabin roof fell in and there was the same
great shower of orange sparks. And now the gimcrack
timbered roof of the lobby block was going. It caved
slowly inwards and then collapsed like a badly cooked
soufflé, and more showers of sparks went up gaily and
burned themselves out as they briefly drifted away on
the wind. The extra burst of flame showed up the two
cars beside the road, the grey Thunderbird and the
shining black sedan. But there was still no sign of the
gangsters and none of James Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">I suddenly realized that I had forgotten all about
time. I looked at my watch. It was two o’clock. So it
was only five hours since all this had begun! It could
have been weeks. My former life seemed almost years
away. Even last evening, when I had sat and thought
about that life, was difficult to remember. Everything
had suddenly been erased. Fear and pain and danger
had taken over. It was like being in a shipwreck, an
aeroplane- or a train-crash, an earthquake or a hurricane.
When these things happen to you, it must be
just the same. The black wings of emergency blot out
the sky and there is no past and no future. You live
through each minute, survive each second, as though
it is your last. There is no other time, no other place,
but now and here.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then I saw the men! They were coming up
towards me on the grass, and each was carrying a big
box in his hands. They were television sets. They must
have salvaged them to sell and make themselves a little
extra cash. They walked side by side, the thin man and
the squat, and the light from the flaming cabins shone
on their sweating faces. When they came to the charred
arches of the covered way to the lobby block, they
trotted quickly through, after glancing up at the still-burning
roof to make sure it wouldn’t fall on them.
Where was James Bond? This was the perfect time to
get them, with their hands full!</p>

<p class="pindent">Now they were only twenty yards away from me,
veering right towards their car. I cringed back into the
dark cave of the car-port. But where was James? Should
I run out after them and take them on alone? Don’t
be idiotic! If I missed, and I certainly would, that would
be the end of me. Now, if they turned round, would
they see me? Would my white overalls show up in the
darkness? I got farther back. Now they were framed
in the square opening of my car-port as they walked
across the grass a few yards from the still-standing
north wall of the lobby building from which the wind
had so far kept most of the flames. They would soon
vanish round the corner and a wonderful chance would
have gone!</p>

<p class="pindent">And then they stopped, stockstill, and there was
James facing them, his gun aiming dead steady between
the two bodies! His voice cracked like a whip across
the lawn. ‘All right! This is it! Turn round! The first
man drops his television gets shot.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They turned slowly round so that they faced towards
my hideout. And now James called to me, ‘Come over,
Viv! I need extra hands.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I took the heavy revolver out of the waistband of
my overalls and ran quickly across the grass. When I
was about ten yards from the men, James said, ‘Just
stop there, Viv, and I’ll tell you what to do.’ I stopped.
The two evil faces stared at me. The thin man’s teeth
were bared in a sort of fixed grin of surprise and
tension. Sluggsy let off a string of curses. I pointed
my gun at the television set that covered his stomach.
‘Shut your mouth or I’ll shoot you dead.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Sluggsy sneered. ‘You and who else? You’d be too
frightened of the bang.’</p>

<p class="pindent">James said, ‘Shut up you, or you get a crack on that
ugly head of yours. Now listen, Viv, we’ve got to get
the guns off these men. Come round behind the one
called Horror. Put your gun up against his spine and
with your free hand feel under his armpits. Not a nice
job but it can’t be helped. Tell me if you feel a gun
there and I’ll tell you what to do next. We’ll go at this
slowly. I’ll cover the other, and if this Horror moves
let him have it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I did as I was told. I went round behind the thin
man and pressed the gun into his back. Then I reached
up with my left hand and felt under his right arm. A
nasty, dead kind of smell came from him, and I was
suddenly disgusted at being so close to him and
touching him so intimately.</p>

<p class="pindent">I know that my hand trembled, and it must have been
that that made him take the chance, for, suddenly, in
one quick flow of motion, he had dropped the television,
whirled like a snake, slapping the gun out of my hand
with his open palm, and clutched me to him.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond’s gun roared and I felt the wind of a
bullet, and then I began to fight like a demon, kicking
and scratching and clawing. But I might have been
fighting with a stone statue. He just squeezed me more
agonizingly to him and I heard his dry voice say, ‘Okay,
limey. Now what? Want the dame to get herself
killed?’</p>

<p class="pindent">I could feel one of his hands loosening itself from
me to get to his gun and I began struggling again.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond said sharply, ‘Viv. Get your legs
apart!’</p>

<p class="pindent">I automatically did as I was told and again his gun
roared. The thin man let out a curse and set me free,
but at the same time there came a splintering crash
from behind me and I whirled round. At the same
time as he had fired, Sluggsy had hurled the television
set over his head at James Bond and it had crashed
into his face, knocking him off balance.</p>

<p class="pindent">As Sluggsy shouted, ‘Scram, Horror!’ I dived for my
gun and, prone in the grass, clumsily fired it at Sluggsy.
I would probably have missed him anyway, but he was
already on the move, weaving across the lawn towards
the cabins like a football player, with the thin man
scrambling desperately after him. I fired again, but the
gun kicked high, and then they were out of range and
Sluggsy disappeared into Number 1 cabin away on the
right.</p>

<p class="pindent">I got up and ran to James Bond. He was kneeling
down in the grass with one hand to his head. As I
came up he took the hand away, looked at it and swore.
There was a big gash just below the hairline. I didn’t
say anything, but ran to the nearest window of the
lobby building and smashed it in with the butt of my
gun. A burst of heat came out at me, but no flames,
and, just below, almost within reach, was the table the
gangsters had used, and on it, among some smouldering
remains of the roof, the first-aid kit. James
Bond shouted something, but I was already over the
sill. I held my breath against the fumes, grabbed the
box and scrambled out again, my eyes stinging with
the smoke.</p>

<p class="pindent">I wiped the wound as clean as I could, and got out
merthiolate and a big Band-aid. The cut wasn’t deep,
but there would soon be a bad bruise. He said, ‘Sorry,
Viv. I made rather a hash of that round.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I thought he had too. I said, ‘Why didn’t you just
shoot them down? They were sitting ducks with those
sets in their hands.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He said curtly, ‘Never been able to in cold blood.
But at least I ought to have been able to blast that
man’s foot off. Must have just nicked it, and now he’s
still in the game.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I said severely, ‘It seems to me damned lucky you’re
in it too. Why didn’t Sluggsy kill you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Your guess is as good as mine. It looks as if they’ve
got some kind of a headquarters over at Number 1.
Perhaps he left his armament there while they did the
job on the lobby. He may not have liked carrying live
bullets around with him so near to the flames. Anyway,
war’s declared now, and we’re going to have quite a
job on our hands. Main thing is to keep an eye on
their car. They’ll be pretty desperate to get away. But
they’ve somehow got to kill us first. They’re in a nasty
fix and they’ll fight like hell-cats.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I finished fixing the cut. James Bond had been
watching cabin Number 1. Now he said, ‘Better get
under cover. They may have got something heavy in
there, and they’ll have finished fixing the Horror’s foot.’
He got to his feet. He suddenly yanked my arm, and
said, ‘Quick!’ At the same time I heard the tinkle of
glass away on the right and a deafening rattle that I
supposed was some kind of machine-gun. On our
heels, bullets whipped into the side of the lobby
building.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond smiled. ‘Sorry again, Viv! My reactions
don’t seem all that smart tonight. I’ll do better.’ He
paused. ‘Now, let’s just think for a minute.’</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a long minute, and I was sweating with the
heat from the burning lobby. Now there was only the
north wall and the bit we were sheltering behind as
far as the front door. The rest was a mass of flames.
But the wind was still blowing the fire southwards and
it seemed to me that this last bit of masonry might
stand up a long while yet. Most of the cabins were on
their way to burning out and, on that side of the
clearing, there was a lessening of the glare and sparks.
It crossed my mind that the blaze must have been
visible for miles, perhaps even as far as Lake George
or Glens Falls, yet no one had turned up to help.
Probably the highway patrols and the fire services had
enough on their hands with the havoc caused by the
storm. And, as for their beloved forests, they would
reckon that no fire could spread through this soaking
landscape.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond said, ‘Now this is what we’re going to
do. First of all, I want you somewhere where you can
help but where I don’t have to worry about you. Otherwise,
if I know these men, they’ll concentrate on you
and guess that I’ll do anything, even let them get away,
rather than let you get hurt.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Is that true?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t be silly. So you get on over the road under
cover of this bit of building and then work back,
keeping well out of sight, until you’re just about
opposite their car. Stay quiet, and even if one or both
of them gets to the car, hold your fire until I tell you
to shoot. All right?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But where will you be?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We’ve got what are known as interior lines of
defence—if we consider the cars as the objective. I’m
going to stick around here and let them come at me.
It’s they who want to get us and get away. Let ’em try.
Time’s against them.’ He looked at his watch. ‘It’s nearly
three. How long before first light around here?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘About two hours. Around five. But there are two
of them and only one of you! They’ll do a sort of
what they call “pincers movement”.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘One of the crabs has lost a claw. Anyway, that’s the
best I can do for a master plan. Now you get on across
the road before they start something. I’ll keep them
occupied.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He went to the corner of the building, edged round
and took two quick shots at the right-hand cabin. There
was a distant crash of glass and then the vicious blast
of the sub-machine-gun. Bullets splatted into the
masonry and whipped across the road into the trees.
James Bond had pulled back. He smiled encouragingly.
‘Now!’</p>

<p class="pindent">I ran to the right and across the road, keeping the
lobby building between me and the end cabin, and
scrambled in among the trees. Once again they tore
and scratched at me, but now I had proper shoes on
and the material of the overalls was tough. I got well
inside the wood and then began working along to the
left. When I thought I had gone far enough I crept
down towards the light from the flames. I ended up
where I had wanted to, just inside the first line of trees
with the black sedan about twenty yards away on the
other side of the road and a fairly clear view of the
flickering battlefield.</p>

<p class="pindent">All this while, the moon had been dodging in and
out through the scudding clouds—in turns lighting
everything brightly and then switching itself off and
leaving only the changing glare that came mostly from
the blazing left half of the lobby block. Now the moon
came fully out and showed me something that almost
made me scream. The thin man, crawling on his
stomach, was worming his way up the north side of
the lobby block and the moonlight glinted on the gun
in his hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond was where I had left him and, to keep
him there, Sluggsy now kept up a steady stream of
single shots that flicked every few seconds at the angle
of the wall towards which the thin man was worming
his way. Perhaps James Bond guessed the significance
of this steady fire. He may have known that it was
meant to pin him down, because now he began moving
along to the left, towards the burning half of the
building. And now he was running, bent low, out across
the browned grass and through the billowing smoke
and sparks towards the charred, flickering ruins of the
left-hand line of cabins. I caught a brief glimpse of
him diving through one of the car-ports at around
Number 15 and then he was gone, presumably into
the trees at the back to work his way up and take
Sluggsy in the rear.</p>

<p class="pindent">I watched the thin man. He was nearly at the corner
of the building. Now he was there. The single shots
ceased. Without taking aim, and firing with his left
hand, the thin man edged his gun round the corner
and sprayed a whole magazine, blind, down the front
wall where James and I had been standing.</p>

<p class="pindent">When no answering fire came, he jerked his head
round the corner and back again, like a snake, and
then got to his feet and made a sweeping motion with
his hand to show that we had gone.</p>

<p class="pindent">And now there came two quick shots from the
direction of cabin Number 1 followed by a blood-curdling
scream that stopped my heart, and Sluggsy
came backing out on to the lawn, firing from the hip
with his right while his left hand dangled down at his
side. He continued to run backwards, screaming with
pain, but still firing his machine-gun in short bursts,
and then I saw a flicker of movement in one of the
car-ports and there came the deep answering boom of
the heavy automatic. But Sluggsy switched his aim and
James Bond’s guns went silent. Then they began again
from another place and one of the shots must have
hit the machine-gun because Sluggsy suddenly dropped
it and began to run towards the black sedan where the
thin man was crouching, giving long-range covering
fire with two guns. James Bond’s hit on the sub-machine-gun
must have jammed the mechanism for it
went on firing, jerking round like a flaming catherine
wheel in the grass and spraying bullets all over the
place. And then the thin man was in the driving seat
and I heard the engine catch and a spurt of smoke
came from the exhaust, and he flung open the side
door and Sluggsy got to it and the door was slammed
on him by the forward leap of the car.</p>

<p class="pindent">I didn’t wait for James. I ran out into the road and
began blazing away at the back of the car and heard
some of my bullets wham into the metal. Then the
hammer clicked on nothing, and I stood and swore at
the thought of them getting away. But then came the
steady crash of James’s gun from the far side of the
lawn while fire spat back from the front window of
the car. Until all of a sudden the black sedan seemed
to go crazy. It made a wide swerve and looked to be
heading across the lawn straight for James. For a
moment he was caught in its great lights as he stood
there, the sweat gleaming on his naked chest, and fired,
in the classic stance of the dueller, as if at a charging
animal. I thought he was going to be mown down and
I began to run across the grass towards him, but then
the car veered away and, its engine roaring in bottom
gear, made straight for the lake.</p>

<p class="pindent">I stood and watched, fascinated. Thereabouts the
lawn was cut to the edge of a low cliff, about twenty
feet high, below which is a fishing pool, and there were
some rough-hewn benches and tables for people to
sit and picnic. The car tore on, and now, whether or
not it hit a bench, its speed would certainly get it to
the lake. But it missed all the benches and, as I put
my hand up to my mouth in horrified excitement, it
took off over the edge and landed flat on the water
with a giant splash and crash of metal and glass. Then,
quite slowly, it sank, nose down, in a welter of exhaust
gas and bubbles, until there was nothing left but the
trunk and a section of the roof and rear window
slanting up towards the sky.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond was still standing, gazing at the lake,
when I ran up to him and threw my arms round him.
‘Are you all right? Are you hurt?’</p>

<p class="pindent">He turned dazedly towards me and put his arm
round my waist and held me tight. He said vaguely,
‘No. I’m all right.’ He looked back towards the lake.
‘I must have hit the driver, the thin man. Killed him,
and his body jammed the accelerator.’ He seemed to
come to himself. He smiled tautly. ‘Well, that’s certainly
tidied up the situation. No ragged edges to clean up.
Dead and buried all in one go. Can’t say I’m sorry.
They were a couple of real thugs.’ He let go of me
and thrust his gun up into its holster. He smelled of
cordite and sweat. It was delicious. I reached up and
kissed him.</p>

<p class="pindent">We turned away and walked slowly across the grass.
The fire was only burning fitfully now and the
battlefield was almost dark. My watch said it was three
thirty. I suddenly felt utterly, absolutely finished.</p>

<p class="pindent">As if echoing my thoughts, James said, ‘That’s
worked the Benzedrine off. How about getting a little
sleep? There are still four or five cabins in good shape.
How about 2 and 3? Are they desirable suites?’</p>

<p class="pindent">I felt myself blushing. I said obstinately, ‘I don’t
mind what you think, James, but I’m not going to leave
you tonight. You can choose either 2 or 3. I’ll sleep
on the floor.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He laughed, and reached out and hugged me to him.
‘If you sleep on the floor, I’ll sleep on the floor too.
But it seems rather a waste of a fine double bed.
Let’s say Number 3.’ He stopped and looked at me,
pretending to be polite. ‘Or would you rather have
Number 2?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No. Number 3 would be heavenly.’</p>
