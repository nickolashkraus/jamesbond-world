<p class="pindent">At the end of August, when all this happened, Zürich
was as gay as this sullen city can be. The clear, glacier
water of the lake was bright with sailing-boats and
water skiers, the public beaches were thronged with
golden bathers and the glum Bahnhofplatz, and the
Bahnhofstrasse that is the pride of the town, clattered
with rucksacked Jugend who had business with the
mountains. The healthy, well-ordered carnival atmosphere
rasped on my raw nerves and filled my sick heart
with mixed anguish. This was the Kurt’s-eye view of
life—<span class="it">Naturfreude</span>, the simple existence of simple
animals. He and I had shared such a life and on the
surface it had been good. But blond hair and clear
eyes and sunburn are no thicker than the paint on a
woman’s face. They are just another kind of gloss. A
trite reflection, of course, but I had now been let down
both by the worldliness of Derek and by the homespun
of Kurt and I was prepared to lose confidence in every
man. It wasn’t that I had expected Kurt to marry me,
or Derek. I had just expected them to be kind and to
behave like that idiotic word ‘gentlemen’—to be gentle
with me, as I, I thought, had been gentle with them.
That, of course, had been the trouble. I had been too
gentle, too accommodating. I had had the desire to
please (and to take pleasure, but that had been
secondary), and that had marked me as easy meat,
expendable. Well, that was the end of that! From now
on I would take and not give. The world had shown
me its teeth. I would show mine. I had been wet
behind the ears. Now I was dry. I stuck my chin out
like a good little Canadian (well, a fairly good little
Canadian!), and having learned to take it, decided for
a change to dish it out.</p>

<p class="pindent">The business of my abortion, not to mince words,
was good training for my new role. The concierge at
my hotel looked at me with the world-weary eyes of
all concierges and said that the hotel doctor was on
holiday but that there was another who was equally
proficient. (Did he know? Did he guess?) Dr Süsskind
examined me and asked if I had enough money. When
I said I had, he seemed disappointed. The gynaecologist
was more explicit. It seemed that he had a chalet.
Hotels in Zürich were so expensive. Would I not care
to have a period of rest before the operation? I looked
at him with stony eyes and said that the British Consul,
who was my uncle, had invited me to recuperate with
his family and I would be glad if I could enter the
clinic without any delay. It was he who had recommended
Dr Süsskind. No doubt Herr Doktor
Braunschweig knew the Consul?</p>

<p class="pindent">My hocus-pocus was just good enough. It had been
delivered with my new decisive manner and the gambit
had been thought out beforehand. The bifocals registered
shock. There were coolly fervent explanations
and a hasty telephone call to the clinic. Yes, indeed.
Tomorrow afternoon. Just with my overnight things.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was as mentally distressing but as physically painless
as I had expected, and three days later I was back
in my hotel. My mind was made up. I flew back to
England, stayed at the new circular Ariel Hotel near
London Airport until I had got rid of my few small
belongings and paid my bills, and then I made an
appointment with the nearest Vespa dealer, in
Hammersmith, and went to see him.</p>

<p class="pindent">My plan was to go off on my own, for at least a
year, and see the other half of the world. I had had
London. Life there had hit me with a hard left and
right, and I was groggy on my feet. I decided that I
just didn’t belong to the place. I didn’t understand
Derek’s sophisticated world, and I didn’t know how
to manage the clinical, cold-eyed, modern ‘love’ that
Kurt had offered me. I told myself that it was because
I had too much ‘heart’. Neither of these men had
wanted my heart, they had just wanted my body. The
fact that I fell back on this age-old moan of the
discarded woman to explain my failure to hold either
of these men, was, I later decided, a more important
clue to my failure than this business of ‘heart’. The
truth of the matter was that I was just too simple to
survive in the bigtown jungle. I was easy prey for the
predators. I was altogether too ‘Canadian’ to compete
with Europe. So be it! I was simple, so I would go
back to the simple lands. But not to sit and mope and
vegetate. I would go there to explore, to adventure. I
would follow the Fall right down through America,
working my way as waitress, baby-sitter, receptionist,
until I got to Florida, and there I would get a job on
a newspaper and sit in the sunshine until the Spring.
And then I would think again.</p>

<p class="pindent">Once I had made up my mind, the details of my
plan absorbed me, driving out my misery, or at least
keeping it at bay, and anaesthetizing my sense of sin
and shame and failure. I went to the American Automobile
Association in Pall Mall, joined it and got the
maps I needed, and talked to them about transport.
The prices of second-hand cars in America were too
high, as were the running costs, and I suddenly fell in
love with the idea of a motor scooter. At first it seemed
ridiculous, the idea of taking on the great transcontinental
highways with such a tiny machine, but the
thought of being out in the open air, doing around a
hundred miles to the gallon, not having to worry about
garages, travelling light and, let’s admit it, being something
of a sensation wherever I went, made up my
mind, and the Hammersmith dealer did the rest.</p>

<p class="pindent">I knew something about machinery—every North
American child is brought up with motor-cars—and
I weighed up the attractions of the little 125-cc model
and of the sturdier, faster 150-cc Gran Sport. Of
course, I plumped for the sporty one with its marvellous
acceleration and a top speed of nearly sixty. It
would only do around eighty miles to the gallon,
compared with the smaller one’s hundred, but I told
myself that gas was cheap in America and that I must
have the speed or I would take months to get south.
The dealer was enthusiastic. He pointed out that in
bad weather, or if I got tired, I could just put the thing
on a train for a stretch. He could get about thirty
pounds purchase tax off the price of one hundred and
ninety pounds by delivering it to a ship that would get
it over to Canada in ten days. That would give me extra
money to spend on spares and de luxe accessories. I
didn’t need any pressurizing. We did one or two runs
up and down the by-pass, with the dealer sitting on
the back, and the Vespa went like a bird and was as
easy to drive as a bicycle. So I signed up for it, bought
a leopard-skin cover for the seat and spare-wheel,
racy-looking de luxe wheel-trims, a rear mirror, a
luggage rack, white saddle-bags that went beautifully
with the silver finish of the body, a Perspex sports
windscreen and a white crash helmet that made me
feel like Pat Moss. The dealer gave me some good
ideas about clothes, and I went to a store and bought
white overalls with plenty of zips, some big goggles
with soft fur round the edges and a rather dashing pair
of lined black kid motor-cycling gloves. After this I
sat down in my hotel with the maps and planned my
route for the first stage down from Quebec. Then I
booked myself on the cheapest Trans-Canada flight
to Montreal, cabled Aunt Florence, and, on a beautiful
first-of-September morning, I was off.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was strange and lovely to be back after nearly six
years. My aunt said she could hardly recognize me, and
I was certainly surprised by Quebec. When I had left
it, the fortress had seemed vast and majestic. Now it
seemed like a large toy edifice out of Disneyland.
Where it had been awesome, I found, irreverently, that
it looked made out of papier-mâché. And the giant
battles between the Faiths, in which I had once thought
myself to be on the point of being crushed, and the
deep schisms between the Canadiennes and the rest,
were now reduced, with my new perspective, to parish-pump
squabbling. Half ashamed, I found myself
contemptuous of the screaming provincialism of the
town, of the dowdy peasants who lived in it, and of
the all-pervading fog of snobbery and petit bourgeoisie.
No wonder, a child of all this, that I had been
ill-equipped for the great world outside! The marvel
was that I had survived at all.</p>

<p class="pindent">I was careful to keep these thoughts from my aunt,
though I suspect that she was just as startled and
perhaps shocked by the gloss that my ‘finishing’ in
Europe had achieved. She must have found me very
much the town mouse, however gangling and simple
I might feel inside, and she plied me with questions
to discover how deep the gloss went, how much I had
been sullied by the fast life I must have led. She would
have fainted at the truth, and I was careful to say that,
while there had been flirtations, I had returned
unharmed and heart-whole from the scarlet cities
across the water. No, there had not even been a temporary
engagement. No lord, not even a commoner, I
could truthfully say, had proposed to me, and I had
left no boy-friend behind. I don’t think she believed
this. She was complimentary about my looks. I had
become ‘<span class="it">une belle fille</span>’. It seemed that I had developed
‘<span class="it">beaucoup de tempérament</span>’—a French euphemism for ‘sex
appeal’—or at any rate the appearance of it, and it
seemed incredible to her that at twenty-three there was
no man in my life. She was horrified at my plans, and
painted a doomful picture of the dangers that awaited
me on the road. America was full of gangsters. I would
be knocked down on the highway and ‘<span class="it">ravagé</span>’. Anyway,
it was unladylike to travel on a scooter. She hoped that
I would be careful to ride side-saddle. I explained that
my Vespa was a most respectable machine and, when
I went to Montreal and, thrilling with every mile, rode
it back to the house, in my full regalia, she was slightly
mollified, while commenting dubiously that I would
‘<span class="it">faire sensation</span>’.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then, on September 15th, I drew a thousand
dollars in American Express travellers’ cheques from
my small bank balance, scientifically packed my saddle-bags
with what I thought would be a minimum
wardrobe, kissed Aunt Florence goodbye and set off
down the St Lawrence on Route 2.</p>

<p class="pindent">Route 2 from Quebec southwards to Montreal could
be one of the most beautiful roads in the world if it
weren’t for the clutter of villas and bathing huts that
have mushroomed along it since the war. It follows
the great river exactly, clinging to the north bank, and
I knew it well from bathing picnics as a child. But the
St Lawrence Seaway had been opened since then, and
the steady stream of big ships with their thudding
engines and haunting sirens and whistles were a new
thrill.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Vespa hummed happily along at about forty. I
had decided to stick to an average daily run of between
a hundred and fifty and two hundred miles, or about
six hours’ actual driving, but I had no intention of
being bound by any schedule. I wanted to see everything.
If there was an intriguing side road, I would go
up it, and, if I came to a beautiful or interesting place,
I would stop and look at it.</p>

<p class="pindent">A good invention in Canada and the northern part
of the States is the ‘picnic area’—clearings carved out
of the forest or beside a lake or river with plenty of
isolated rough-hewn benches and tables tucked away
among the trees for privacy. I proposed to use these
for luncheon every day when it wasn’t raining, not
buying expensive foods at stores, but making egg-and-bacon
sandwiches in toast before I left each night’s
motel. They, with fruit and a Thermos of coffee, would
be my midday meal and I would make up each evening
with a good dinner. I budgeted for a daily expenditure
of fifteen dollars. Most motels cost eight dollars single,
but there are state taxes added, so I made it nine plus
coffee and a roll for breakfast. Gas would not be more
than a dollar a day and that left five for luncheon and
dinner, an occasional drink and the few cigarettes I
smoked. I wanted to try and keep inside this. The Esso
map and route I had, and the AAA literature, listed
countless sights to see after I had crossed the border—I
would be going right through the Red Indian
country of Fenimore Cooper, and then across some
of the great battlefields of the American Revolution,
for instance—and many of them cost around a dollar
entrance fee. But I thought I would get by, and if on
some days I didn’t, I would eat less on others.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Vespa was far more stable than I had expected,
and wonderfully easy to run. As I got better at the
twist-grip gears, I began really to drive the little machine
instead of just riding on it. The acceleration—up to
fifty in twenty seconds—was good enough to give the
ordinary American sedan quite a shock, and I soared
up hills like a bird with the exhaust purring sweetly
under my tail. Of course I had to put up with a good
deal of wolf-whistling from the young, and grinning
and hand-waving from the old, but I’m afraid I rather
enjoyed being something of the sensation my aunt had
predicted and I smiled with varying sweetness at all
and sundry. The shoulders of most North American
roads are bad and I had been afraid that people would
crowd my tiny machine and that I would be in constant
trouble with potholes, but I suppose I looked such a
fragile little outfit that other drivers gave me a wide
berth and I usually had the whole of the inside lane
of the highway to myself.</p>

<p class="pindent">Things went so well that first day that I managed
to get through Montreal before nightfall and twenty
miles on down Route 9 that would take me over the
border into New York State the next morning. I put
up at a place called The Southern Trail Motel, where
I was treated as if I was Amelia Earhart or Amy
Mollison—a rather pleasurable routine that I became
accustomed to—and, after a square meal in the cafeteria
and the shy acceptance of one drink with the
proprietor, I retired to bed feeling excited and happy.
It had been a long and wonderful day. The Vespa was
a dream, and my whole plan was working out fine.</p>

<p class="pindent">I had taken one day to do the first two hundred
miles. I took nearly two weeks to cover the next two
hundred and fifty. There was no mystery about it. Once
over the American border, I began to wander around
the Adirondacks as if I was on a late summer holiday.
I won’t go into details since this is not a travelogue,
but there was hardly an old fort, museum, waterfall,
cave or high mountain I didn’t visit—not to mention
the dreadful ‘Storylands’, ‘Adventure Towns’ and mock
‘Indian Reservations’ that got my dollar. I just went
on a kind of sightseeing splurge that was part genuine
curiosity but mostly wanting to put off the day when
I would have to leave these lakes and rivers and forests
and hurry on south to the harsh Eldollarado of the
super-highways, the hot-dog stands and the ribboning
lights of neon.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was at the end of these two weeks that I found
myself at Lake George, the dreadful hub of tourism
in the Adirondacks that has somehow managed to turn
the history and the forests and the wildlife into honky-tonk.
Apart from the rather imposing stockade fort
and the harmless steamers that ply up to Fort Ticonderoga
and back, the rest is a gimcrack nightmare of
concrete gnomes, Bambi deer and toadstools, shoddy
foodstalls selling ‘Big Chief Hamburgers’ and ‘Minnehaha
Candy Floss’, and ‘Attractions’ such as ‘Animal
Land’ (‘Visitors may hold and photograph costumed
chimps’), ‘Gaslight Village’ (‘Genuine 1890 gaslighting’),
and ‘Storytown USA’, a terrifying babyland
nightmare which I need not describe. It was here that
I fled away from the horrible mainstream that Route
9 had become, and took to the dusty side road through
the forest that was to lead me to The Dreamy Pines
Motor Court and to the armchair where I have been
sitting remembering just exactly how I happened to
get here.</p>
