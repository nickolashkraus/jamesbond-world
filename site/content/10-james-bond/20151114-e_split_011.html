<h2 id="calibre_toc_12" class="calibre8"><a id="Page_079" class="calibre9"></a>7. ‘Come into My Parlour . . .’</h2>

<p class="pindent">The rain was hammering down just as hard, its steady
roar providing a background to the gurgling torrents
from the downspouts at the four corners of the
building. I looked forward to bed. How soundly I
would sleep between the sheets in the spotless little
cabin—those percale sheets that featured in the advertisements
for the motel! How luxurious the Elliott Frey
beds, Magee custom-designed carpets, Philco television
and air-conditioning, Icemagic ice-makers, Acrilan
blankets and Simmons Vivant furniture (‘Our phenolic
laminate tops and drawers are immune to cigarette
burns, alcohol stains’)—in fact all those refinements
of modern motel luxury down to Acrylite shower
enclosures, Olsonite Pearlescent lavatory-seats and
Delsey ‘bathroom tissue’, otherwise lavatory paper (‘in
modern colours to harmonize with contemporary
décor’) that would be mine, and mine alone, tonight!</p>

<p class="pindent">Despite all these gracious trimmings, plus a beautiful
site, it seemed that The Dreamy Pines was in a bad
way, and, when I had come upon it two weeks before,
there were only two overnighters in the whole place
and not a single reservation for the last fortnight of
the season.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Phancey, an iron-grey woman with bitter,
mistrustful eyes and a grim slit of a mouth, was at the
desk when I came in that evening. She had looked
sharply at me, a lone girl, and at my meagre saddle-bags,
and, when I pushed the Vespa over to Number
9, she followed me with my card in her hand to check
that I had not entered a false vehicle licence. Her
husband, Jed, was more genial, but I soon understood
why when the back of his hand brushed against my
breast as, later in the cafeteria, he put the coffee in
front of me. Apparently he doubled as handyman and
short-order cook and, while his pale brown eyes moved
over me like slugs, he complained whiningly about how
much there was to do around the place getting it ready
for closing date and constantly being called away from
some job to fry eggs for parties of transients. It seemed
they were the managers for the owner. He lived in
Troy. A Mr Sanguinetti. ‘Big shot. Owns plenty property
down on Cohoes Road. Riverfront property. And
The Trojan Horse—roadhouse on Route 9, outside
Albany. Maybe you know the joint?’ When I said I
didn’t, Mr Phancey looked sly. ‘You ever want some
fun, you go along to The Horse. Better not go alone,
though. Pretty gal like you could get herself roughed
up. After the 15th, when I get away from here, you
could give me a call. Phancey’s the name. In the phone
book. Be glad to escort you, show you a good time.’
I thanked him, but said I was just passing through the
district on my way south. Could I have a couple of
fried eggs, sunnyside up, and bacon?</p>

<p class="pindent">But Mr Phancey wouldn’t leave me alone. While I
ate, he came and sat at my little table and told me
some of his dull life-story and, in between episodes,
slipped in questions about me and my plans—what
parents I had, didn’t I mind being so far from home,
did I have any friends in the States, and so on—innocuous
questions, put, it seemed to me, with normal
curiosity. He was after all around forty-five, old enough
to be my father, and though he was obviously a dirty
old man, they were a common enough breed, and
anyway Mrs Phancey was keeping an eye on us from
the desk at the other end of the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Phancey finally left me and went over to his wife
and, while I smoked a cigarette and finished my second
cup of coffee (‘No charge, miss. Compliments of The
Dreamy Pines’), I heard them talking in a low voice
over something that, because of an occasional chuckle,
seemed to give them satisfaction. Finally Mrs Phancey
came over, clucking in a motherly fashion about my
adventurous plans (‘My, oh, my! What will you modern
girls be doing next?’), and then she sat down and,
looking as winsome as she knew how, said why didn’t
I stop over for a few days and have a rest and earn
myself a handful of dollars into the bargain? It seemed
their receptionist had walked out twenty-four hours
before and, what with the housekeeping and tidying-up
before they closed the place for the season, they would
have no time to man the desk. Would I care to take
on the job of receptionist for the final two weeks—full
board and thirty dollars a week?</p>

<p class="pindent">Now it happened that I could do very well with
those sixty dollars and some free food and lodging. I
had overspent at least fifty dollars on my tourist spree,
and this would just about square my books. I didn’t
much care for the Phanceys, but I told myself that
they were no worse than the sort of people I had
expected to meet on my travels. Besides, this was the
first job I had been offered and I was rather curious
to see how I would make out. Perhaps, too, they would
give me a reference at the end of my time and this
might help with other motel jobs on my way south.
So, after a bit of polite probing, I said the idea would
be fine. The Phanceys seemed very pleased and
Millicent, as she had now become, showed me the
registration system, told me to watch out for people
with little luggage and big station-wagons, and took
me on a quick tour of the establishment.</p>

<p class="pindent">The business about the station-wagons opened my
eyes to the seamy side of the motel business. It seemed
that there were people, particularly young couples just
married and in process of setting up house, who would
check in at some lonely motel carrying at least the
minimum ‘passport’ of a single suitcase. This suitcase
would in fact contain nothing but a full set of precision
tools, together with false licence plates for their
roomy station-wagon that would be parked in the
car-port alongside their cabin door. After locking themselves
in and waiting for the lights to go out in the
office, the couple would set to work on inconspicuous
things like loosening the screws of the bathroom
fixtures, testing the anchoring of the TV set and so
on. Once the management had gone to bed, they would
really get down to it, making neat piles of bedding,
towels and shower curtains, dismantling light-fixtures,
bedframes, lavatory-seats and even the lavatories themselves
if they had plumbing knowledge. They worked
in darkness of course, with pencil torches, and, when
everything was ready, say around two in the morning,
they would quietly carry everything through the door
into the car-port and pile it into the station-wagon.
The last job would be to roll up the carpets and use
them, the reverse side up, as tarpaulins to cover the
contents of the station-wagon. Then change the plates
and softly away with their new bedroom suite all ready
to lay out in their unfurnished flat many miles away
in another State!</p>

<p class="pindent">Two or three hauls like that would also look after
the living-room and spare bedroom and they would
be set up for life. If they had a garden, or a front
porch, a few midnight forays around the rich, out-of-town
‘swimming-pool’ residences would take care of
the outdoor furniture, children’s heavy playthings,
perhaps even the lawn-mower and sprinklers.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Phancey said the motels had no defence against
this sort of attack. Everything was screwed down that
could be screwed down, and marked with the name
of the motel. The only hope was to smell the marauders
when they registered and then either turn them away
or sit up all night with a shotgun. In cities, motels had
other problems—prostitutes who set up shop,
murderers who left corpses in the shower, and
occasional holdups for the money in the cash register.
But I was not to worry. Just call for Jed if I smelled
trouble. He could act real tough and he had a gun.
And, with this cold comfort, I was left to ponder on
the darker side of the motel industry.</p>

<p class="pindent">Of course it all turned out perfectly all right and
the job was no problem. In fact there was so little to
do that I did rather wonder why the Phanceys had
bothered to take me on. But they were lazy and it
wasn’t their money they were paying me and I guessed
that part of the reason was that Jed thought he had
found himself an easy lay. But that also was no
problem. I just had to dodge his hands and snub him
icily on an average of once a day and hook a chair
under my door handle when I went to bed to defeat
the pass-key he tried on my second night.</p>

<p class="pindent">We had a few overnighters in the first week and I
found that I was expected to lend a hand with the
housekeeping, but that too was all right with me, and
anyway the customers slacked off, until, after October
10th, there wasn’t a single one.</p>

<p class="pindent">Apparently October 15th is a kind of magical date
in this particular holiday world. Everything closes down
on that day, except along the major highways.</p>

<p class="pindent">It is supposed to be the beginning of winter. There
is the hunting season coming up, but the rich hunters
have their own hunting clubs and camps in the mountains,
and the poor ones take their cars to one or
another of the picnic areas and climb up into the
forests before dawn to get their deer. Anyway, around
October 15th the tourists disappear from the scene
and there is no more easy money to be made in the
Adirondacks.</p>

<p class="pindent">As closing day came nearer, there was a good deal
of talk on the telephone between the Phanceys and
Mr Sanguinetti in Troy, and on the 11th Mrs Phancey
told me casually that she and Jed would be leaving for
Troy on the 13th and would I mind staying in charge
that night and handing over the keys to Mr Sanguinetti,
who would be coming up finally to close the place
around noon on the 14th?</p>

<p class="pindent">It seemed a vague sort of arrangement to leave an
unknown girl in charge of such a valuable property,
but it was explained that the Phanceys would be taking
the cash and the register and the stock of food and
drinks with them, and all I had to do was switch off
the lights and lock up before I went to bed. Mr
Sanguinetti would be coming up with trucks for the
rest of the movables the next morning. Then I could
be on my way. So I said yes, that would be all right,
and Mrs Phancey beamed and said I was a very good
girl, but when I asked if she would give me a reference,
she got cagey and said she would have to leave
that to Mr Sanguinetti, but she would make a point
of telling him how helpful I had been.</p>

<p class="pindent">So the last day was spent packing things into their
station-wagon until the stores and cafeteria were empty
of everything except plenty of bacon and eggs and
coffee and bread for me and for the truckers to eat
when they came up.</p>

<p class="pindent">That last day I had expected the Phanceys to be
rather nice to me. After all we had got on all right
together and I had gone out of my way to be helpful
about everything. But oddly enough, they were just
the reverse. Mrs Phancey ordered me about as if I was
a skivvy, and Jed became tough and nasty in his leching,
using filthy words even when his wife was in earshot
and quite openly reaching for my body whenever he
got within range. I couldn’t understand the change. It
was as if they had had what they wanted out of me
and could now discard me with contempt—and even,
it seemed to me, almost with loathing. I got so furious
that I finally went to Mrs Phancey and said I was going
and could I have my money? But she just laughed, and
said, oh, no. Mr Sanguinetti would be giving me that.
They couldn’t take a chance of the cutlery being short
when he came to count it. After this, and rather than
face them at supper, I made myself some jam sandwiches
and went and locked myself in my cabin and
prayed for the morning, when they would be gone.
And, as I have said, six o’clock did at last come and I
saw the last of the monsters.</p>

<p class="pindent">And now this was my last night at The Dreamy
Pines and tomorrow I would be off again. It had been
a slice of life, not totally unpleasant in spite of the
Phanceys, and I had learned the fringes of a job that
might stand me in good stead. I looked at my watch.
It was nine o’clock and here was the doomful WOKO
from Albany with its storm bulletin. The Adirondacks
would be clear by midnight. So, with any luck, I would
have dry roads in the morning. I went behind the
cafeteria bar, turned on the electric cooker, and put
out three eggs and six slices of hickory-smoked
bacon. I was hungry.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then came a loud hammering on the door.</p>
