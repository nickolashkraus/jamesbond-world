<p class="pindent">The head gipsy’s voice cracked out. The girls separated
reluctantly and stood facing him. The gipsy began to
speak in a tone of harsh denunciation.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim put his hand up to his mouth and whispered
behind it. ‘Vavra is telling them that this is a great tribe
of gipsies and they have brought dissension among it.
He says there is no room for hatred among themselves,
only against those outside. The hatred they have created
must be purged so that the tribe can live peacefully
again. They are to fight. If the loser is not killed she
will be banished for ever. That will be the same as death.
These people wither and die outside the tribe. They
cannot live in our world. It is like wild beasts forced to
live in a cage.’</p>

<p class="pindent">While Kerim spoke, Bond examined the two beautiful,
taut, sullen animals in the centre of the ring.</p>

<p class="pindent">They were both gipsy-dark, with coarse black hair
to their shoulders, and they were both dressed in the
collection of rags you associate with shanty-town
Negroes—tattered brown shifts that were mostly darns
and patches. One was bigger-boned than the other,
and obviously stronger, but she looked sullen and slow-eyed
and might not be quick on her feet. She was
handsome in a rather leonine way, and there was a slow
red glare in her heavy lidded eyes as she stood and
listened impatiently to the head of the tribe. She ought
to win, thought Bond. She is half an inch taller, and
she is stronger.</p>

<p class="pindent">Where this girl was a lioness, the other was a panther—lithe
and quick and with cunning sharp eyes that
were not on the speaker but sliding sideways, measuring
inches, and the hands at her sides were curled into
claws. The muscles of her fine legs looked hard as a
man’s. The breasts were small, and, unlike the big
breasts of the other girl, hardly swelled the rags of her
shift. She looks a dangerous little bitch of a girl, thought
Bond. She will certainly get in the first blow. She will
be too quick for the other.</p>

<p class="pindent">At once he was proved wrong. As Vavra spoke his
last word, the big girl, who, Kerim whispered, was called
Zora, kicked hard sideways, without taking aim, and
caught the other girl square in the stomach and, as the
smaller girl staggered, followed up with a swinging blow
of the fist to the side of the head that knocked her
sprawling on to the stone floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oi, Vida,’ lamented a woman in the crowd. She
needn’t have worried. Even Bond could see that Vida
was shamming as she lay on the ground, apparently
winded. He could see her eyes glinting under her bent
arm as Zora’s foot came flashing at her ribs.</p>

<p class="pindent">Vida’s hands flickered out together. They grasped the
ankle and her head struck into the instep like a snake’s.
Zora gave a scream of pain and wrenched furiously at
her trapped foot. It was too late. The other girl was up
on one knee, and then standing erect, the foot still in
her hands. She heaved upwards and Zora’s other foot
left the ground and she crashed full-length.</p>

<p class="pindent">The thud of the big girl’s fall shook the ground. For
a moment she lay still. With an animal snarl, Vida dived
on top of her, clawing and tearing.</p>

<p class="pindent">My God, what a hell-cat, thought Bond. Beside him,
Kerim’s breath hissed tensely through his teeth.</p>

<p class="pindent">But the big girl protected herself with her elbows
and knees and at last she managed to kick Vida off. She
staggered to her feet and backed away, her lips bared
from her teeth and the shift hanging in tatters from her
splendid body. At once she went in to the attack again,
her arms groping forward for a hold and, as the smaller
girl leapt aside, Zora’s hand caught the neck of her shift
and split it down to the hem. But immediately Vida
twisted in close under the reaching arms and her fists
and knees thudded into the attacker’s body.</p>

<p class="pindent">This infighting was a mistake. The strong arms
clamped shut round the smaller girl, trapping Vida’s
hands low down so that they could not reach up for
Zora’s eyes. And, slowly, Zora began to squeeze, while
Vida’s legs and knees thrashed ineffectually below.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond thought that now the big girl must win. All
Zora had to do was to fall on the other girl. Vida’s head
would crack down on the stone and then Zora could
do as she liked. But all of a sudden it was the big girl
who began to scream. Bond saw that Vida’s head was
buried deep in the other’s breasts. Her teeth were at
work. Zora’s arms let go as she reached for Vida’s hair
to pull the head back and away from her. But now Vida’s
hands were free and they were scrabbling at the big
girl’s body.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girls tore apart and backed away like cats, their
shining bodies glinting through the last rags of their
shifts and blood showing on the exposed breasts of
the big girl.</p>

<p class="pindent">They circled warily, both glad to have escaped, and
as they circled they tore off the last of their rags and
threw them into the audience.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond held his breath at the sight of the two glistening,
naked bodies, and he could feel Kerim’s body
tense beside him. The ring of gipsies seemed to have
come closer to the two fighters. The moon shone on
glittering eyes and there was the whisper of hot, panting
breath.</p>

<p class="pindent">Still the two girls circled slowly, their teeth bared and
their breath coming harshly. The light glinted off their
heaving breasts and stomachs and off their hard, boyish
flanks. Their feet left dark sweat marks on the white
stones.</p>

<p class="pindent">Again it was the big girl, Zora, who made the first
move with a sudden forward leap and arms held out
like a wrestler’s. But Vida stood her ground. Her right
foot lashed out in a furious <span class="it">coup de savate</span> that made a
slap like a pistol shot. The big girl gave a wounded cry
and clutched at herself. At once Vida’s other foot kicked
up to the stomach and she threw herself in after it.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a low growl from the crowd as Zora
went down on her knees. Her hands went up to protect
her face, but it was too late. The smaller girl was
astride her, and her hands grasped Zora’s wrists as
she bore down on her with all her weight and bent
her to the ground, her bared white teeth reaching
towards the offered neck.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘BOOM!’</p>

<p class="pindent">The explosion cracked the tension like a nut. A flash
of flame lit the darkness behind the dance floor and
a chunk of masonry sang past Bond’s ear. Suddenly
the orchard was full of running men and the head
gipsy was slinking forward across the stone with his
curved dagger held out in front of him. Kerim was
going after him, a gun in his hand. As the gipsy passed
the two girls, now standing wild-eyed and trembling,
he shouted a word at them and they took to their heels
and disappeared among the trees where the last of the
women and children were already vanishing among the
shadows.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond, the Beretta held uncertainly in his hand,
followed slowly in the wake of Kerim towards the wide
breach that had been blown out of the garden wall, and
wondered what the hell was going on.</p>

<p class="pindent">The stretch of grass between the hole in the wall and
the dance floor was a turmoil of fighting, running figures.
It was only as Bond came up with the fight that he
distinguished the squat, conventionally dressed Bulgars
from the swirling finery of the gipsies. There seemed
to be more of the Faceless Ones than of the gipsies,
almost two to one. As Bond peered into the struggling
mass, a gipsy youth was ejected from it, clutching his
stomach. He groped towards Bond, coughing terribly.
Two small dark men came after him, their knives held
low.</p>

<p class="pindent">Instinctively Bond stepped to one side so that the
crowd was not behind the two men. He aimed at their
legs above the knees and the gun in his hand cracked
twice. The two men fell, soundlessly, face downwards
in the grass.</p>

<p class="pindent">Two bullets gone. Only six left. Bond edged closer
to the fight.</p>

<p class="pindent">A knife hissed past his head and clanged on to the
dance floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">It had been aimed at Kerim, who came running out
of the shadows with two men on his heels. The second
man stopped and raised his knife to throw and Bond
shot from the hip, blindly, and saw him fall. The other
man turned and fled among the trees and Kerim
dropped to one knee beside Bond, wrestling with his
gun.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Cover me,’ he shouted. ‘Jammed on the first shot.
It’s those bloody Bulgars. God knows what they think
they’re doing.’</p>

<p class="pindent">A hand caught Bond round the mouth and yanked
him backwards. On his way to the ground he smelled
carbolic soap and nicotine. He felt a boot thud into
the back of his neck. As he whirled over sideways in
the grass he expected to feel the searing flame of a
knife. But the men, and there were three of them, were
after Kerim, and as Bond scrambled to one knee he
saw the squat black figures pile down on the crouching
man, who gave one lash upwards with his useless gun
and then went down under them.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the same moment as Bond leaped forward and
brought his gun butt down on a round shaven head,
something flashed past his eyes and the curved dagger
of the head gipsy was growing out of a heaving back.
Then Kerim was on his feet and the third man was
running and a man was standing in the breach in the
wall shouting one word, again and again, and one by
one the attackers broke off their fights and doubled
over to the man and past him and out on to the
road.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Shoot, James, shoot!’ roared Kerim. ‘That’s Krilencu.’
He started to run forward. Bond’s gun spat once. But
the man had dodged round the wall, and thirty yards
is too far for night shooting with an automatic. As Bond
lowered his hot gun, there came the staccato firing of
a squadron of Lambrettas, and Bond stood and listened
to the swarm of wasps flying down the hill.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was silence except for the groans of the
wounded. Bond listlessly watched Kerim and Vavra
come back through the breach in the wall and walk
among the bodies, occasionally turning one over with
a foot. The other gipsies seeped back from the road
and the older women came hurrying out of the shadows
to tend their men.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shook himself. What the hell had it all been about?
Ten or a dozen men had been killed. What for? Whom
had they been trying to get? Not him, Bond. When he
was down and ready for the killing they had passed him
by and made for Kerim. This was the second attempt on
Kerim’s life. Was it anything to do with the Romanova
business? How could it possibly tie in?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond tensed. His gun spoke twice from the hip. The
knife clattered harmlessly off Kerim’s back. The figure
that had risen from the dead twirled slowly round like a
ballet dancer and toppled forward on his face. Bond ran
forward. He had been just in time. The moon had caught
the blade and he had had a clear field of fire. Kerim
looked down at the twitching body. He turned to meet
Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stopped in his tracks. ‘You bloody fool,’ he said
angrily. ‘Why the hell can’t you take more care! You
ought to have a nurse.’ Most of Bond’s anger came
from knowing that it was he who had brought a cloud
of death around Kerim.</p>

<p class="pindent">Darko Kerim grinned shamefacedly. ‘Now it is not
good, James. You have saved my life too often. We
might have been friends. Now the distance between us
is too great. Forgive me, for I can never pay you back.’
He held out his hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond brushed it aside. ‘Don’t be a damn fool, Darko,’
he said roughly. ‘My gun worked, that’s all. Yours didn’t.
You’d better get one that does. For Christ’s sake tell
me what the hell this is all about. There’s been too
much blood splashing about tonight. I’m sick of it. I
want a drink. Come and finish that raki.’ He took the
big man’s arm.</p>

<p class="pindent">As they reached the table, littered with the remains
of the supper, a piercing, terrible scream came out of
the depths of the orchard. Bond put his hand on his
gun. Kerim shook his head. ‘We shall soon know what
the Faceless Ones were after,’ he said gloomily. ‘My
friends are finding out. I can guess what they will
discover. I think they will never forgive me for having
been here tonight. Five of their men are dead.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There might have been a dead woman too,’ said Bond
unsympathetically. ‘At least you’ve saved her life. Don’t
be stupid, Darko. These gipsies knew the risks when
they started spying for you against the Bulgars. It was
gang warfare.’ He added a dash of water to two tumblers
of raki.</p>

<p class="pindent">They both emptied the glasses at one swallow. The
head gipsy came up, wiping the tip of his curved dagger
on a handful of grass. He sat down and accepted a
glass of raki from Bond. He seemed quite cheerful.
Bond had the impression that the fight had been too
short for him. The gipsy said something, slyly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim chuckled. ‘He said that his judgment was right.
You killed well. Now he wants you to take on those
two women.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Tell him even one of them would be too much for
me. But tell him I think they are fine women. I would
be glad if he would do me a favour and call the fight
a draw. Enough of his people have been killed tonight.
He will need these two girls to bear children for the
tribe.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim translated. The gipsy looked sourly at Bond
and said a few bitter words.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He says that you should not have asked him such a
difficult favour. He says that your heart is too soft for
a good fighter. But he says he will do what you ask.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The gipsy ignored Bond’s smile of thanks. He started
talking fast to Kerim, who listened attentively, occasionally
interrupting the flow with a question. Krilencu’s
name was often mentioned. Kerim talked back. There
was deep contrition in his voice and he refused to allow
himself to be stopped by protests from the other. There
came a last reference to Krilencu. Kerim turned to
Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My friend,’ he said drily. ‘It is a curious affair. It seems
the Bulgars were ordered to kill Vavra and as many of
his men as possible. That is a simple matter. They knew
the gipsy had been working for me. Perhaps, rather
drastic. But in killing, the Russians have not much
finesse. They like mass death. Vavra was a main target.
I was another. The declaration of war against me
personally I can also understand. But it seems that you
were not to be harmed. You were exactly described so
that there should be no mistake. That is odd. Perhaps
it was desired that there should be no diplomatic repercussions.
Who can tell? The attack was well planned.
They came to the top of the hill by a roundabout route
and free-wheeled down so that we should hear nothing.
This is a lonely place and there is not a policeman for
miles. I blame myself for having treated these people
too lightly.’ Kerim looked puzzled and unhappy. He
seemed to make up his mind. He said, ‘But now it is
midnight. The Rolls will be here. There remains a small
piece of work to be done before we go home to bed.
And it is time we left these people. They have much to
do before it is light. There are many bodies to go into
the Bosphorus and there is the wall to be repaired. By
daylight there must be no trace of these troubles. Our
friend wishes you very well. He says you must return,
and that Zora and Vida are yours until their breasts fall.
He refuses to blame me for what has happened. He
says that I am to continue sending him Bulgars. Ten
were killed tonight. He would like some more. And now
we will shake him by the hand and go. That is all he
asks of us. We are good friends, but we are gajos. And
I expect he does not want us to see his women weeping
over their dead.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim stretched out his huge hand. Vavra took it
and held it and looked into Kerim’s eyes. For a moment
his own fierce eyes seemed to go opaque. Then the
gipsy let the hand drop and turned to Bond. The hand
was dry and rough and padded like the paw of a big
animal. Again the eyes went opaque. He let go of
Bond’s hand. He spoke rapidly and urgently to Kerim
and turned his back on them and walked away towards
the trees.</p>

<p class="pindent">Nobody looked up from his work as Kerim and Bond
climbed through the breach in the wall. The Rolls stood,
glittering in the moonlight, a few yards down the road
opposite the café entrance. A young man was sitting
beside the chauffeur. Kerim gestured with his hand.
‘That is my tenth son. He is called Boris. I thought I
might need him. I shall.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The youth turned and said, ‘Good evening, sir.’ Bond
recognized him as one of the clerks in the warehouse.
He was as dark and lean as the head clerk, and his eyes
also were blue.</p>

<p class="pindent">The car moved down the hill. Kerim spoke to the
chauffeur in English. ‘It is a small street off the Hippodrome
Square. When we get there we will proceed softly.
I will tell you when to stop. Have you got the uniforms
and the equipment?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, Kerim Bey.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right. Make good speed. It is time we were all in
bed.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim sank back in his seat. He took out a cigarette.
They sat and smoked. Bond gazed out at the drab streets
and reflected that sparse street-lighting is the sure sign
of a poor town.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was some time before Kerim spoke. Then he said,
‘The gipsy said we both have the wings of death over
us. He said that I am to beware of a son of the snows
and you must beware of a man who is owned by the
moon.’ He laughed harshly. ‘That is the sort of rigmarole
they talk. But he says that Krilencu isn’t either of
these men. That is good.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Why?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Because I cannot sleep until I have killed that man.
I do not know if what happened tonight has any connection
with you and your assignment. I do not care. For
some reason, war has been declared on me. If I do not
kill Krilencu, at the third attempt he will certainly kill
me. So we are now on our way to keep an appointment
with him in Samarra.’</p>
