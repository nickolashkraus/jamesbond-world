<p class="pindent">It had all depended on the man’s accuracy. Nash had
said that Bond would get one bullet through the heart.
Bond had taken the gamble that Nash’s aim was as good
as he said it was. And it had been.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond lay like a dead man lies. Before the bullet, he
had recalled the corpses he had seen—how their bodies
had looked in death. Now he lay totally collapsed, like
a broken doll, his arms and legs carefully outflung.</p>

<p class="pindent">He explored his sensations. Where the bullet had
crashed into the book, his ribs were on fire. The bullet
must have gone through the cigarette case and then
through the other half of the book. He could feel the
hot lead over his heart. It felt as if it was burning
inside his ribs. It was only a sharp pain in his head
where it had hit the woodwork, and the violet sheen
on the scuffed toecaps against his nose, that said he
wasn’t dead.</p>

<p class="pindent">Like an archæologist, Bond explored the carefully
planned ruin of his body. The position of the sprawled
feet. The angle of the half-bent knee that would give
purchase when it was needed. The right hand that
seemed to be clawing at his pierced heart, was within
inches, when he could release the book, of the little
attaché case—within inches of the lateral stitching that
held the flat-bladed throwing-knives, two edged and
sharp as razors, that he had mocked when Q Branch
had demonstrated the catch that held them. And his
left hand, outflung in the surrender of death, rested on
the floor and would provide upward leverage when the
moment came.</p>

<p class="pindent">Above him there sounded a long, cavernous yawn.
The brown toecaps shifted. Bond watched the shoe-leather
strain as Nash stood up. In a minute, with Bond’s
gun in his right hand, Nash would climb on to the
bottom bunk and reach up and feel through the curtain
of hair for the base of the girl’s neck. Then the snout
of the Beretta would nuzzle in after the probing fingers,
Nash would press the trigger. The roar of the train
would cover the muffled boom.</p>

<p class="pindent">It would be a near thing. Bond desperately tried to
remember simple anatomy. Where were the mortal places
in the lower body of a man? Where did the main artery
run? The Femoral. Down the inside of the thigh. And
the External Iliac, or whatever it was called, that became
the Femoral? Across the centre of the groin. If he missed
both, it would be bad. Bond had no illusions about being
able to beat this terrific man in unarmed combat. The
first violent stab of his knife had to be decisive.</p>

<p class="pindent">The brown toecaps moved. They pointed towards
the bunk. What was the man doing? There was no
sound except the hollow iron clang as the great train
tore through the Simplon—through the heart of the
Wasenhorn and Monte Leone. The toothglass tinkled.
The woodwork creaked comfortably. For a hundred
yards on both sides of the little death cell rows of
people were sleeping, or lying awake, thinking of their
lives and loves, making little plans, wondering who
would meet them at the Gare de Lyon. And, all the
while, just along the corridor, death was riding with
them down the same dark hole, behind the same great
Diesel, on the same hot rails.</p>

<p class="pindent">One brown shoe left the floor. It would have stepped
half across Bond. The vulnerable arch would be open
above Bond’s head.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s muscles coiled like a snake’s. His right hand
flickered a few centimetres to the hard stitching on the
edge of the case. Pressed sideways. Felt the narrow
shaft of the knife. Drew it softly half way out without
moving his arm.</p>

<p class="pindent">The brown heel lifted off the ground. The toe bent
and took the weight.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now the second foot had gone.</p>

<p class="pindent">Softly move the weight here, take the purchase there,
grasp the knife hard so that it wouldn’t turn on a bone,
and then . . .</p>

<p class="pindent">In one violent corkscrew of motion, Bond’s body
twisted up from the floor. The knife flashed.</p>

<p class="pindent">The fist with the long steel finger, and all Bond’s arm
and shoulder behind it, lunged upwards. Bond’s knuckles
felt flannel. He held the knife in, forcing it further.</p>

<p class="pindent">A ghastly wailing cry came down to him. The Beretta
clattered to the floor. Then the knife was wrenched
from Bond’s hand as the man gave a convulsive twist
and crashed down.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had planned for the fall, but, as he sidestepped
towards the window, a flailing hand caught him and
sent him thudding on to the lower bunk. Before he
could recover himself, up from the floor rose the
terrible face, its eyes shining violet, the violet teeth
bared. Slowly, agonizingly, the two huge hands groped
for him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond, half on his back, kicked out blindly. His shoe
connected; but then his foot was held and twisted and
he felt himself slipping downwards.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s fingers scrabbled for a hold in the stuff of
the bunk. Now the other hand had him by the thigh.
Nails dug into him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s body was being twisted and pulled down.
Soon the teeth would be at him. Bond hammered out
with his free leg. It made no difference. He was
going.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly Bond’s scrabbling fingers felt something
hard. The book! How did one work the thing? Which
way up was it? Would it shoot him or Nash? Desperately
Bond held it out towards the great sweating face. He
pressed at the base of the cloth spine.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Click!’ Bond felt the recoil. ‘Click-click-click-click.’
Now Bond felt the heat under his fingers. The hands
on his legs were going limp. The glistening face was
drawing back. A noise came from the throat, a terrible
gurgling noise. Then, with a slither and a crack, the
body fell forward on to the floor and the head crashed
back against the woodwork.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">Bond lay and panted through clenched teeth. He stared
up at the violet light above the door. He noticed that
the loop of the filament waxed and waned. It crossed
his mind that the dynamo under the carriage must be
defective. He blinked his eyes to focus the light more
closely. The sweat ran into them and stung. He lay still,
doing nothing about it.</p>

<p class="pindent">The galloping boom of the train began to change. It
sounded hollower. With a final echoing roar, the Orient
Express sped out into the moonlight and slackened
speed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond lazily reached up and pulled at the edge of the
blind. He saw warehouses and sidings. Lights shone
brightly, cleanly on the rails. Good, powerful lights.
The lights of Switzerland.</p>

<p class="pindent">The train slid quietly to a stop.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the steady, singing silence, a small noise came
from the floor. Bond cursed himself for not having
made certain. He quickly bent down, listening. He held
the book forward at the ready, just in case. No movement.
Bond reached and felt for the jugular vein. No
pulse. The man was quite dead. The corpse had been
settling.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat back and waited impatiently for the train
to move again. There was a lot to be done. Even before
he could see to Tatiana, there would have to be the
cleaning up.</p>

<p class="pindent">With a jerk the long express started softly rolling.
Soon the train would be slaloming fast down through
the foothills of the Alps into the Canton Valais. Already
there was a new sound in the wheels—a hurrying lilt,
as if they were glad the tunnel was past.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got to his feet and stepped over the sprawling
legs of the dead man and turned on the top light.</p>

<p class="pindent">What a shambles! The place looked like a butcher’s
shop. How much blood did a body contain? He remembered.
Ten pints. Well, it would soon all be there. As
long as it didn’t spread into the passage! Bond stripped
the bedclothes off the bottom bunk and set to work.</p>

<p class="pindent">At last the job was done—the walls swabbed down
around the covered bulk on the floor, the suitcases ready
for the get-away to Dijon.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond drank down a whole carafe of water. Then he
stepped up and gently shook the shoulder of fur.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was no response. Had the man lied? Had he
killed her with the poison?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond thrust his hand in against her neck. It was
warm. Bond felt for the lobe of an ear and pinched it
hard. The girl stirred sluggishly and moaned. Again
Bond pinched the ear, and again. At last a muffled voice
said, ‘Don’t.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled. He shook her. He went on shaking until
Tatiana slowly turned over on her side. Two doped blue
eyes gazed into his and closed again. ‘What is it?’ The
voice was sleepily angry.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond talked to her and bullied her and cursed her.
He shook her more roughly. At last she sat up. She gazed
vacantly at him. Bond pulled her legs out so that they
hung down over the edge. Somehow he manhandled
her down on to the bottom bunk.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana looked terrible—the slack mouth, the
upturned, sleep-drunk eyes, the tangle of damp hair.
Bond got to work with a wet towel and her comb.</p>

<p class="pindent">Lausanne came and, an hour later, the French frontier
at Vallorbes. Bond left Tatiana and went out and stood
in the corridor, just in case. But the customs and passport
men brushed past him to the conductor’s cabin,
and, after five inscrutable minutes, went on down the
train.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stepped back into the compartment. Tatiana
was asleep again. Bond looked at Nash’s watch, which
was now on his own wrist. 4.30. Another hour to Dijon.
Bond set to work.</p>

<p class="pindent">At last Tatiana’s eyes opened wide. Her pupils were
more or less centred. She said, ‘Stop it now, James.’ She
closed her eyes again. Bond wiped the sweat off his
face. He took the bags, one by one, to the end of the
corridor and piled them against the exit. Then he went
along to the conductor and told him that Madame was
not well and that they would be leaving the train at
Dijon.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gave the conductor a final tip. ‘Do not derange
yourself,’ he said. ‘I have taken the luggage out so as
not to disturb Madame. My friend, the one with fair
hair, is a doctor. He has been sitting up with us all night.
I have put him to sleep in my bunk. The man was
exhausted. It would be kind not to waken him until ten
minutes before Paris.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Certainement, Monsieur.</span>’ The conductor had not been
showered with money like this since the good days of
travelling millionaires. He handed over Bond’s passport
and tickets. The train began to slacken speed. ‘<span class="it">Voilà que
nous y sommes.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond went back to the compartment. He dragged
Tatiana to her feet and out into the corridor and shut
the door on the white pile of death beside the bunk.</p>

<p class="pindent">At last they were down the steps and on to the hard,
wonderful, motionless platform. A blue-smocked porter
took their luggage.</p>

<p class="pindent">The sun was beginning to rise. At that hour of the
morning there were very few passengers awake. Only
a handful in the third-class, who had ridden ‘hard’
through the night, saw a young man help a young girl
away from the dusty carriage with the romantic names
on its side towards the drab door that said ‘<span class="sc">sortie</span>’.</p>
