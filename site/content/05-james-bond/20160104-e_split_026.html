<p class="pindent">The great trains are going out all over Europe, one by
one, but still, three times a week, the Orient Express
thunders superbly over the 1400 miles of glittering steel
track between Istanbul and Paris.</p>

<p class="pindent">Under the arc-lights, the long-chassied German
locomotive panted quietly with the laboured breath
of a dragon dying of asthma. Each heavy breath
seemed certain to be the last. Then came another.
Wisps of steam rose from the couplings between the
carriages and died quickly in the warm August air. The
Orient Express was the only live train in the ugly,
cheaply architectured burrow that is Istanbul’s main
station. The trains on the other lines were engineless
and unattended—waiting for tomorrow. Only Track
No3, and its platform, throbbed with the tragic poetry
of departure.</p>

<p class="pindent">The heavy bronze cipher on the side of the dark
blue coach said, <span class="sc">compagnie internationale des
wagon-lits et des grands express européens</span>.
Above the cipher, fitted into metal slots, was a flat iron
sign that announced, in black capitals on white,
<span class="sc">orient express</span>, and underneath, in three lines:</p>

<div class="lgc"> <!-- rend=';sc;' -->
<p class="line6">istanbul          thessaloniki          beograd</p>
<p class="line6">venezia          milan</p>
<p class="line6">lausanne          paris</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class="pindent">James Bond gazed vaguely at one of the most romantic
signs in the world. For the tenth time he looked at his
watch. 8.51. His eyes went back to the sign. All the towns
were spelled in the language of the country except <span class="sc">milan</span>.
Why not <span class="sc">milano</span>? Bond took out his handkerchief and
wiped his face. Where the hell was the girl? Had she been
caught? Had she had second thoughts? Had he been too
rough with her last night, or rather this morning, in the
great bed?</p>

<p class="pindent">8.55. The quiet pant of the engine had stopped. There
came an echoing whoosh as the automatic safety-valve
let off the excess steam. A hundred yards away, through
the milling crowd, Bond watched the stationmaster raise
a hand to the engine driver and fireman and start walking
slowly back down the train, banging the doors of the
third-class carriages up front. Passengers, mostly peasants
going back into Greece after a weekend with their
relatives in Turkey, hung out of the windows and
jabbered at the grinning crowd below.</p>

<p class="pindent">Beyond, where the faded arc-lights stopped and the
dark blue night and the stars showed through the crescent
mouth of the station, Bond saw a red pinpoint
turn to green.</p>

<p class="pindent">The stationmaster came nearer. The brown uniformed
wagon-lit attendant tapped Bond on the arm. ‘<span class="it">En voiture,
s’il vous plaît.</span>’ The two rich-looking Turks kissed their
mistresses—they were too pretty to be wives—and,
with a barrage of laughing injunctions, stepped on to
the little iron pedestal and up the two tall steps into the
carriage. There were no other wagon-lit travellers on
the platform. The conductor, with an impatient glance
at the tall Englishman, picked up the iron pedestal and
climbed with it into the train.</p>

<p class="pindent">The stationmaster strode purposefully by. Two more
compartments, the first- and second-class carriages, and
then, when he reached the guard’s van, he would lift
the dirty green flag.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was no hurrying figure coming up the platform
from the <span class="it">guichet</span>. High up above the guichet, near the
ceiling of the station, the minute hand of the big illuminated
clock jumped forward an inch and said ‘Nine’.</p>

<p class="pindent">A window banged down above Bond’s head. Bond
looked up. His immediate reaction was that the black
veil was too wide-meshed. The intention to disguise
the luxurious mouth and the excited blue eyes was
amateurish.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Quick.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The train had begun to move. Bond reached for the
passing handrail and swung up on to the step. The
attendant was still holding open the door. Bond stepped
unhurriedly through.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Madam was late,’ said the attendant. ‘She came along
the corridor. She must have entered by the last carriage.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond went down the carpeted corridor to the centre
coupé. A black 7 stood above a black 8 on the white
metal lozenge. The door was ajar. Bond walked in and
shut it behind him. The girl had taken off her veil and
her black straw hat. She was sitting in the corner by the
window. A long, sleek sable coat was thrown open to
show a natural coloured shantung dress with a pleated
skirt, honey-coloured nylons and a black crocodile belt
and shoes. She looked composed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You have no faith, James.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat down beside her. ‘Tania,’ he said, ‘if there
was a bit more room I’d put you across my knee and
spank you. You nearly gave me heart failure. What
happened?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nothing,’ said Tatiana innocently. ‘What could happen?
I said I would be here, and I am here. You have no faith.
Since I am sure you are more interested in my dowry
than in me, it is up there.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked casually up. Two small cases were on
the rack beside his suitcase. He took her hand. He said,
‘Thank God you’re safe.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Something in his eyes, perhaps the flash of guilt, as
he admitted to himself that he had been more interested
in the girl than the machine, reassured her. She kept
his hand in hers and sank contentedly back in her
corner.</p>

<p class="pindent">The train screeched slowly round Seraglio Point. The
lighthouse lit up the roofs of the dreary shacks along
the railway line. With his free hand Bond took out a
cigarette and lit it. He reflected that they would soon
be passing the back of the great billboard where
Krilencu had lived—until less than twenty-four hours
ago. Bond saw again the scene in every detail. The white
crossroads, the two men in the shadows, the doomed
man slipping out through the purple lips.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl watched his face with tenderness. What was
this man thinking? What was going on behind those
cold level grey-blue eyes that sometimes turned soft
and sometimes, as they had done last night before his
passion had burned out in her arms, blazed like
diamonds. Now they were veiled in thought. Was he
worrying about them both? Worrying about their safety?
If only she could tell him that there was nothing to
fear, that he was only her passport to England—him
and the heavy case the Resident Director had given her
that evening in the office. The Director had said the
same thing. ‘Here is your passport to England, Corporal,’
he had said cheerfully. ‘Look.’ He had unzipped the bag:
‘A brand-new Spektor. Be certain not to open the bag
again or let it out of your compartment until you get
to the other end. Or this Englishman will take it away
from you and throw you on the dust-heap. It is this
machine they want. Do not let them take it from you,
or you will have failed in your duty. Understood?’</p>

<p class="pindent">A signal box loomed up in the blue dusk outside the
window. Tatiana watched Bond get up and pull down the
window and crane out into the darkness. His body was
close to her. She moved her knee so that it touched him.
How extraordinary, this passionate tenderness that had
filled her ever since she had seen him last night standing
naked at the window, his arms up to hold the curtains
back, his profile, under the tousled black hair, intent and
pale in the moonlight. And then the extraordinary fusing
of their eyes and their bodies. The flame that had suddenly
lit between them—between the two secret agents, thrown
together from enemy camps a whole world apart, each
involved in his own plot against the country of the other,
antagonists by profession, yet turned, and by the orders
of their governments, into lovers.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana stretched out a hand and caught hold of the
edge of the coat and tugged at it. Bond pulled up the
window and turned. He smiled down at her. He read
her eyes. He bent and put his hands on the fur over
her breasts and kissed her hard on the lips. Tatiana leant
back, dragging him with her.</p>

<p class="pindent">There came a soft double knock on the door. Bond
stood up. He pulled out his handkerchief and brusquely
scrubbed the rouge off his lips. ‘That’ll be my friend
Kerim,’ he said. ‘I must talk to him. I will tell the
conductor to make up the beds. Stay here while he does
it. I won’t be long. I shall be outside the door.’ He leant
forward and touched her hand and looked at her wide
eyes and at her rueful, half-open lips. ‘We shall have all
the night to ourselves. First I must see that you are
safe.’ He unlocked the door and slipped out.</p>

<p class="pindent">Darko Kerim’s huge bulk was blocking the corridor.
He was leaning on the brass guard-rail, smoking and
gazing moodily out towards the Sea of Marmara that
receded as the long train snaked away from the coast and
turned inland and northwards. Bond leaned on the rail
beside him. Kerim looked into the reflection of Bond’s
face in the dark window. He said softly, ‘The news is not
good. There are three of them on the train.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ah!’ An electric tingle ran up Bond’s spine.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s the three strangers we saw in that room. Obviously
they’re on to you and the girl.’ Kerim glanced sharply
sideways. ‘That makes her a double. Or doesn’t it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s mind was cool. So the girl had been bait. And
yet, and yet. No, damn it. She couldn’t be acting. It
wasn’t possible. The cipher machine? Perhaps after all
it wasn’t in that bag. ‘Wait a minute,’ he said. He turned
and knocked softly on the door. He heard her unlock
it and slip the chain. He went in and shut the door. She
looked surprised. She had thought it was the conductor
come to make up the beds.</p>

<p class="pindent">She smiled radiantly. ‘You have finished?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sit down, Tatiana. I’ve got to talk to you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Now she saw the coldness in his face and her smile
went out. She sat down obediently with her hands in
her lap.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stood over her. Was there guilt in her face, or
fear? No, only surprise and a coolness to match his own
expression.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now listen, Tatiana,’ Bond’s voice was deadly. ‘Something’s
come up. I must look into that bag and see if
the machine is there.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She said indifferently. ‘Take it down and look.’ She
examined the hands in her lap. So now it was going to
come. What the Director had said. They were going
to take the machine and throw her aside, perhaps have
her put off the train. Oh God! This man was going to
do that to her.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond reached up and hauled down the heavy case
and put it on the seat. He tore the zip sideways and
looked in. Yes, a grey japanned metal case with three
rows of squat keys, rather like a typewriter. He held the
bag open towards her. ‘Is that a Spektor?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She glanced casually into the gaping bag. ‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond zipped the bag shut and put it back on the
rack. He sat down beside the girl. ‘There are three MGB
men on the train. We know they are the ones who
arrived at your centre on Monday. What are they doing
here, Tatiana?’ Bond’s voice was soft. He watched her,
searched her with all his senses.</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked up. There were tears in her eyes. Were
they the tears of a child found out? But there was no
trace of guilt in her face. She only looked terrified of
something.</p>

<p class="pindent">She reached out a hand and then drew it back. ‘You
aren’t going to throw me off the train now you’ve got
the machine?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course not,’ Bond said impatiently. ‘Don’t be
idiotic. But we must know what these men are doing.
What’s it all about? Did you know they were going to
be on the train?’ He tried to read some clue in her
expression. He could only see a great relief. And what
else? A look of calculation? Of reserve? Yes, she was
hiding something. But what?</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana seemed to make up her mind. Brusquely she
wiped the back of her hand across her eyes. She reached
forward and put the hand on his knee. The streak of
tears showed on the back of the hand. She looked into
Bond’s eyes, forcing him to believe her.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘James,’ she said. ‘I did not know these men were
on the train. I was told they were leaving today. For
Germany. I assumed they would fly. That is all I can
tell you. Until we arrive in England, out of reach of
my people, you must not ask me more. I have done
what I said I would. I am here with the machine. Have
faith in me. Do not be afraid for us. I am certain
these men do not mean us harm. Absolutely certain.
Have faith.’ (Was she so certain, wondered Tatiana?
Had the Klebb woman told her all the truth? But she
also must have faith—faith in the orders she had been
given. These men must be the guards to see that she
didn’t get off the train. They could mean no harm. Later,
when they got to London, this man would hide her away
out of reach of <span class="sc">smersh</span> and she would tell him everything
he wanted to know. She had already decided this
in the back of her mind. But God knew what would
happen if she betrayed <span class="it">Them</span> now. <span class="it">They</span> would somehow
get her, and him. She knew it. There were no secrets
from these people. And <span class="it">They</span> would have no mercy. So
long as she played out her role, all would be well.) Tatiana
watched Bond’s face for a sign that he believed her.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shrugged his shoulders. He stood up. ‘I don’t
know what to think, Tatiana,’ he said. ‘You are keeping
something from me, but I think it’s something you don’t
know is important. And I believe you think we are safe.
We may be. It may be a coincidence that these men are
on the train. I must talk to Kerim and decide what to
do. Don’t worry. We will look after you. But now we
must be very careful.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked round the compartment. He tried the
communicating door with the next coupé. It was locked.
He decided to wedge it when the conductor had gone.
He would do the same for the door into the passage.
And he would have to stay awake. So much for the
honeymoon on wheels! Bond smiled grimly to himself
and rang for the conductor. Tatiana was looking
anxiously up at him. ‘Don’t worry, Tania,’ he said again.
‘Don’t worry about anything. Go to bed when the man
has gone. Don’t open the door unless you know it’s me.
I will sit up tonight and watch. Perhaps tomorrow it
will be easier. I will make a plan with Kerim. He is a
good man.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The conductor knocked. Bond let him in and went
out into the corridor. Kerim was still there gazing out.
The train had picked up speed and was hurtling through
the night, its harsh melancholy whistle echoing back at
them from the walls of a deep cutting against the sides
of which the lighted carriage windows flickered and
danced. Kerim didn’t move, but his eyes in the mirror
of the window were watchful.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond told him of the conversation. It was not easy
to explain to Kerim why he trusted the girl as he did.
He watched the mouth in the window curl ironically as
he tried to describe what he had read in her eyes and
what his intuition told him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim sighed resignedly. ‘James,’ he said, ‘you are now
in charge. This is your part of the operation. We have
already argued most of this out today—the danger of
the train, the possibility of getting the machine home
in the diplomatic bag, the integrity, or otherwise, of
this girl. It certainly appears that she has surrendered
unconditionally to you. At the same time you admit
that you have surrendered to her. Perhaps only partially.
But you have decided to trust her. In this morning’s
telephone talk with M he said that he would back your
decision. He left it to you. So be it. But he didn’t know
we were to have an escort of three MGB men. Nor
did we. And I think that would have changed all our
views. Yes?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Then the only thing to do is eliminate these three
men. Get them off the train. God knows what they’re
here for. I don’t believe in coincidences any more than
you. But one thing is certain. We are not going to share
the train with these men. Right?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Then leave it to me. At least for tonight. This is still
my country and I have certain powers in it. And plenty
of money. I cannot afford to kill them. The train would
be delayed. You and the girl might get involved. But I
shall arrange something. Two of them have sleeping
berths. The senior man with the moustache and the
little pipe is next door to you—here in No6.’ He
gestured backwards with his head. ‘He is travelling on
a German passport under the name of “Melchior Benz,
salesman”. The dark one, the Armenian, is in No12.
He, too, has a German passport—“Kurt Goldfarb,
construction engineer”. They have through tickets to
Paris. I have seen their documents. I have a police card.
The conductor made no trouble. He has all the tickets
and passports in his cabin. The third man, the man
with a boil on the back of his neck, turns out also to
have boils on his face. A stupid, ugly looking brute. I
have not seen his passport. He is travelling sitting up
in the first-class, in the next compartment to me. He
does not have to surrender his passport until the frontier.
But he has surrendered his ticket.’ Like a conjurer,
Kerim flicked a yellow first-class ticket out of his coat
pocket. He slipped it back. He grinned proudly at
Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How the hell?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim chuckled. ‘Before he settled down for the
night, this dumb ox went to the lavatory. I was standing
in the corridor and I suddenly remembered how we
used to steal rides on the train when I was a boy. I
gave him a minute. Then I walked up and rattled the
lavatory door. I hung on to the handle very tight.
“Ticket collector,” I said in a loud voice. “Tickets
please.” I said it in French and again in German. There
was a mumble from inside. I felt him try to open the
door. I hung on tight so that he would think the door
had stuck. “Do not derange yourself, Monsieur,” I said
politely. “Push the ticket under the door.” There was
more fiddling with the door handle and I could hear
heavy breathing. Then there was a pause and a rustle
under the door. There was the ticket. I said, “<span class="it">Merci,
Monsieur</span>” very politely. I picked up the ticket and
stepped across the coupling into the next carriage.’
Kerim airily waved a hand. ‘The stupid oaf will be
sleeping peacefully by now. He will think that his ticket
will be given back to him at the frontier. He is mistaken.
The ticket will be in ashes and the ashes will be on the
four winds,’ Kerim gestured towards the darkness
outside. ‘I will see that the man is put off the train,
however much money he has got. He will be told that
the circumstances must be investigated, his statements
corroborated with the ticket agency. He will be allowed
to proceed on a later train.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled at the picture of Kerim playing his
private-school trick. ‘You’re a card, Darko. What about
the other two?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Darko Kerim shrugged his massive shoulders.
‘Something will occur to me,’ he said confidently. ‘The
way to catch Russians is to make them look foolish.
Embarrass them. Laugh at them. They can’t stand it.
We will somehow make these men sweat. Then we
will leave it to the MGB to punish them for failing in
their duty. Doubtless they will be shot by their own
people.’</p>

<p class="pindent">While they were talking, the conductor had come out
of No7. Kerim turned to Bond and put a hand on his
shoulder. ‘Have no fear, James,’ he said cheerfully. ‘We
will defeat these people. Go to your girl. We will meet
again in the morning. We shall not sleep much tonight,
but that cannot be helped. Every day is different.
Perhaps we shall sleep tomorrow.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond watched the big man move off easily down the
swaying corridor. He noticed that, despite the movement
of the train, Kerim’s shoulders never touched the
walls of the corridor. Bond felt a wave of affection for
the tough, cheerful professional spy.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim disappeared into the conductor’s cabin. Bond
turned and knocked softly on the door of No7.</p>
