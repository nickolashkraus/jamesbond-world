<p class="pindent">James Bond awoke early in his dingy room at the Kristal
Palas on the heights of Pera and absent-mindedly
reached down a hand to explore a sharp tickle on the
outside of his right thigh. Something had bitten him
during the night. Irritably he scratched the spot. He
might have expected it.</p>

<p class="pindent">When he had arrived the night before, to be greeted
by a surly night-concierge in trousers and a collarless
shirt, and had briefly inspected the entrance hall with
the fly-blown palms in copper pots, and the floor and
walls of discoloured Moorish tiles, he had known what
he was in for. He had half thought of going to another
hotel. Inertia, and a perverse liking for the sleazy
romance that clings to old-fashioned Continental
hotels, had decided him to stay, and he had signed in
and followed the man up to the third floor in the old
rope-and-gravity lift.</p>

<p class="pindent">His room, with its few sticks of aged furniture and
an iron bedstead, was what he had expected. He only
looked to see if there were the blood spots of squashed
bugs on the wallpaper behind the bedhead before
dismissing the concierge.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had been premature. When he went into the
bathroom and turned on the hot tap it gave a deep sigh,
then a deprecating cough, and finally ejected a small
centipede into the basin. Bond morosely washed the
centipede away with the thin stream of brownish water
from the cold tap. So much, he had reflected wryly, for
choosing a hotel because its name had amused him and
because he had wanted to get away from the soft life
of big hotels.</p>

<p class="pindent">But he had slept well, and now, with the reservation
that he must buy some insecticide, he decided to forget
about his comforts and get on with the day.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got out of bed, drew back the heavy red plush
curtains and leant on the iron balustrade and looked out
over one of the most famous views in the world—on
his right the still waters of the Golden Horn, on his left
the dancing waves of the unsheltered Bosphorus, and, in
between, the tumbling roofs, soaring minarets and
crouching mosques of Pera. After all, his choice had been
good. The view made up for many bedbugs and much
discomfort.</p>

<p class="pindent">For ten minutes Bond stood and gazed out across
the sparkling water barrier between Europe and Asia,
then he turned back into the room, now bright with
sunshine, and telephoned for his breakfast. His English
was not understood, but his French at last got through.
He turned on a cold bath and shaved patiently with
cold water and hoped that the exotic breakfast he had
ordered would not be a fiasco.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was not disappointed. The yoghourt, in a blue
china bowl, was deep yellow and with the consistency
of thick cream. The green figs, ready peeled, were
bursting with ripeness, and the Turkish coffee was jet
black and with the burned taste that showed it had been
freshly ground. Bond ate the delicious meal on a table
drawn up beside the open window. He watched the
steamers and the caiques criss-crossing the two seas
spread out before him and wondered about Kerim and
what fresh news there might be.</p>

<p class="pindent">Punctually at nine, the elegant Rolls came for him
and took him through Taksim square and down the
crowded Istiklal and out of Asia. The thick black
smoke of the waiting steamers, badged with the
graceful crossed anchors of the Merchant Marine,
streamed across the first span of the Galata Bridge
and hid the other shore towards which the Rolls nosed
forward through the bicycles and trams, the well-bred
snort of the ancient bulb horn just keeping the pedestrians
from under its wheels. Then the way was clear
and the old European section of Istanbul glittered at
the end of the broad half-mile of bridge with the slim
minarets lancing up into the sky and the domes of
the mosques, crouching at their feet, looking like big
firm breasts. It should have been the Arabian Nights,
but to Bond, seeing it first above the tops of trams
and above the great scars of modern advertising along
the river frontage, it seemed a once beautiful theatre-set
that modern Turkey had thrown aside in favour
of the steel and concrete flat-iron of the Istanbul-Hilton
Hotel, blankly glittering behind him on the
heights of Pera.</p>

<p class="pindent">Across the bridge, the car nosed to the right down a
narrow cobbled street parallel with the waterfront and
stopped outside a high wooden porte-cochère.</p>

<p class="pindent">A tough-looking watchman with a chunky, smiling
face, dressed in frayed khaki, came out of a porter’s
lodge and saluted. He opened the car door and gestured
for Bond to follow him. He led the way back into his
lodge and through a door into a small courtyard with
a neatly raked gravel parterre. In the centre was a gnarled
eucalyptus tree at whose foot two white ring-doves were
pecking about. The noise of the town was a distant
rumble and it was quiet and peaceful.</p>

<p class="pindent">They walked across the gravel and through another
small door and Bond found himself at one end of a
great vaulted godown with high circular windows
through which dusty bars of sunshine slanted across a
vista of bundles and bales of merchandise. There was
a cool, musty scent of spices and coffee and, as Bond
followed the watchman down the central passageway, a
sudden strong wave of mint.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the end of the long warehouse was a raised platform
enclosed by a balustrade. On it half a dozen young
men and girls sat on high stools and wrote busily in
fat, old-fashioned ledgers. It was like a Dickensian
counting-house and Bond noticed that each high desk
had a battered abacus beside the inkpot. Not one of
the clerks looked up as Bond walked between them,
but a tall, swarthy man with a lean face and unexpected
blue eyes came forward from the furthest desk and took
delivery of him from the watchman. He smiled warmly
at Bond, showing a set of extremely white teeth, and
led him to the back of the platform. He knocked on a
fine mahogany door with a Yale lock and, without
waiting for an answer, opened it and let Bond in and
closed the door softly behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ah, my friend. Come in. Come in.’ A very large man
in a beautifully cut cream tussore suit got up from a
mahogany desk and came to meet him, holding out his
hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">A hint of authority behind the loud friendly voice
reminded Bond that this was the Head of Station T,
and that Bond was in another man’s territory and juridically
under his command. It was no more than a point
of etiquette, but a point to remember.</p>

<p class="pindent">Darko Kerim had a wonderfully warm dry handclasp.
It was a strong Western handful of operative fingers—not
the banana skin handshake of the East that makes
you want to wipe your fingers on your coat-tails. And
the big hand had a coiled power that said it could easily
squeeze your hand tighter and tighter until finally it
cracked your bones.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was six feet tall, but this man was at least two
inches taller and he gave the impression of being twice
as broad and twice as thick as Bond. Bond looked up
into two wide apart, smiling blue eyes in a large smooth
brown face with a broken nose. The eyes were watery
and veined with red, like the eyes of a hound who lies
too often too close to the fire. Bond recognized them
as the eyes of furious dissipation.</p>

<p class="pindent">The face was vaguely gipsy-like in its fierce pride and
in the heavy curling black hair and crooked nose, and the
effect of a vagabond soldier of fortune was heightened
by the small thin gold ring Kerim wore in the lobe of his
right ear. It was a startlingly dramatic face, vital, cruel and
debauched, but what one noticed more than its drama
was that it radiated life. Bond thought he had never seen
so much vitality and warmth in a human face. It was like
being close to the sun, and Bond let go the strong dry
hand and smiled back at Kerim with a friendliness he
rarely felt for a stranger.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thanks for sending the car to meet me last night.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ha!’ Kerim was delighted. ‘You must thank our
friends too. You were met by both sides. They always
follow my car when it goes to the airport.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Was it a Vespa or a Lambretta?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You noticed? A Lambretta. They have a whole fleet
of them for their little men, the men I call “The Faceless
Ones”. They look so alike, we have never managed
to sort them out. Little gangsters, mostly stinking
Bulgars, who do their dirty work for them. But I expect
this one kept well back. They don’t get up close to the
Rolls any more since the day my chauffeur stopped
suddenly and then reversed back as hard as he could.
Messed up the paintwork and bloodied the bottom of
the chassis but it taught the rest of them manners.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim went to his chair and waved to an identical one
across the desk. He pushed over a flat white box of
cigarettes and Bond sat down and took a cigarette and
lit it. It was the most wonderful cigarette he had ever
tasted—the mildest and sweetest of Turkish tobacco in
a slim long oval tube with an elegant gold crescent.</p>

<p class="pindent">While Kerim was fitting one into a long nicotine-stained
ivory holder, Bond took the opportunity to
glance round the room, which smelled strongly of paint
and varnish as if it had just been redecorated.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was big and square and panelled in polished
mahogany, except behind Kerim’s chair where a length
of Oriental tapestry hung down from the ceiling and
gently moved in the breeze as if there was an open
window behind it. But this seemed unlikely as light came
from three circular windows high up in the walls.
Perhaps, behind the tapestry, was a balcony looking out
over the Golden Horn, whose waves Bond could hear
lapping at the walls below. In the centre of the right-hand
wall hung a gold-framed reproduction of
Annigoni’s portrait of the Queen. Opposite, also imposingly
framed, was Cecil Beaton’s wartime photograph
of Winston Churchill looking up from his desk in the
Cabinet Offices like a contemptuous bulldog. A broad
bookcase stood against one wall and, opposite, a
comfortably padded leather settee. In the centre of the
room the big desk winked with polished brass handles.
On the littered desk were three silver photograph
frames, and Bond caught a sideways view of the copperplate
script of two Mentions in Dispatches and the
Military Division of the OBE.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim lit his cigarette. He jerked his head back at the
piece of tapestry. ‘Our friends paid me a visit yesterday,’
he said casually. ‘Fixed a limpet bomb on the wall
outside. Timed the fuse to catch me at my desk. By
good luck, I had taken a few minutes off to relax on
the couch over there with a young Rumanian girl who
still believes that a man will tell secrets in exchange for
love. The bomb went off at a vital moment. I refused
to be disturbed, but I fear the experience was too much
for the girl. When I released her, she had hysterics. I’m
afraid she had decided that my love-making is altogether
too violent.’ He waved his cigarette holder apologetically.
‘But it was a rush to get the room put to rights in
time for your visit. New glass for the windows and my
pictures, and the place stinks of paint. However.’ Kerim
sat back in his chair. There was a slight frown on his
face. ‘What I cannot understand is this sudden breach
of the peace. We live together very amicably in Istanbul.
We all have our work to do. It is unheard of that my
<span class="it">chers collègues</span> should suddenly declare war in this way. It
is quite worrying. It can only lead to trouble for our
Russian friends. I shall be forced to rebuke the man
who did it when I have found out his name.’ Kerim
shook his head. ‘It is most confusing. I am hoping it
has nothing to do with this case of ours.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But was it necessary to make my arrival so public?’
Bond asked mildly. ‘The last thing I want is to get you
involved in all this. Why send the Rolls to the airport?
It only ties you in with me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim’s laugh was indulgent. ‘My friend, I must
explain something which you should know. We and the
Russians and the Americans have a paid man in all the
hotels. And we have all bribed an official of the Secret
police at Headquarters and we receive a carbon copy
of the list of all foreigners entering the country every
day by air or train or sea. Given a few more days I could
have smuggled you in through the Greek frontier. But
for what purpose? Your existence here has to be known
to the other side so that our friend can contact you. It
is a condition she has laid down that she will make her
own arrangements for the meeting. Perhaps she does
not trust our security. Who knows? But she was definite
about it, and she said, as if I didn’t know it, that her
centre would immediately be advised of your arrival.’
Kerim shrugged his broad shoulders. ‘So why make
things difficult for her? I am merely concerned with
making things easy and comfortable for you so that you
will at least enjoy your stay—even if it is fruitless.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. ‘I take it all back. I’d forgotten the
Balkan formula. Anyway I’m under your orders here.
You tell me what to do and I’ll do it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim waved the subject aside. ‘And now, since we
are talking of your comfort, how is your hotel? I was
surprised you chose the Palas. It is little better than a
disorderly house—what the French call a <span class="it">baisodrome</span>.
And it’s quite a haunt of the Russians. Not that that
matters.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s not too bad. I just didn’t want to stay at the
Istanbul-Hilton or one of the other smart places.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Money?’ Kerim reached into a drawer and took out
a flat packet of new green notes. ‘Here’s a thousand
Turkish pounds. Their real value, and their rate on the
black market, is about twenty to the pound. The official
rate is seven. Tell me when you’ve finished them and
I’ll give you as many more as you want. We can do our
accounts after the game. It’s muck, anyway. Ever since
Croesus, the first millionaire, invented gold coins, money
has depreciated. And the face of the coin has been
debased as fast as its value. First the faces of gods were
on the coins. Then the faces of kings. Then of presidents.
Now there’s no face at all. Look at this stuff!’
Kerim tossed the money over to Bond. ‘Today it’s only
paper, with a picture of a public building and the signature
of a cashier. Muck! The miracle is that you can still
buy things with it. However. What else? Cigarettes?
Smoke only these. I will have a few hundred sent up to
your hotel. They’re the best. <span class="it">Diplomates.</span> They’re not easy
to get. Most of them go to the Ministries and the Embassies.
Anything else before we get down to business?
Don’t worry about your meals and your leisure. I will
look after both. I shall enjoy it and, if you will forgive
me, I wish to stay close to you while you are here.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nothing else,’ said Bond. ‘Except that you must come
over to London one day.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Never,’ said Kerim definitely. ‘The weather and the
women are far too cold. And I am proud to have you
here. It reminds me of the war. Now,’ he rang a bell
on his desk. ‘Do you like your coffee plain or sweet?
In Turkey we cannot talk seriously without coffee or
raki and it is too early for raki.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Plain.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The door behind Bond opened. Kerim barked an
order. When the door was shut, Kerim unlocked a
drawer and took out a file and put it in front of him.
He smacked his hand down on it.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My friend,’ he said grimly, ‘I do not know what to
say about this case.’ He leant back in his chair and linked
his hands behind his neck. ‘Has it ever occurred to you
that our kind of work is rather like shooting a film? So
often I have got everybody on location and I think I
can start turning the handle. Then it’s the weather, and
then it’s the actors, and then it’s the accidents. And there
is something else that also happens in the making of a
film. Love appears in some shape or form, at the very
worst, as it is now, between the two stars. To me that
is the most confusing factor in this case, and the most
inscrutable one. Does this girl really love her idea of
you? Will she love you when she sees you? Will you be
able to love her enough to make her come over?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond made no comment. There was a knock on the
door and the head clerk put a china eggshell, enclosed
in gold filigree, in front of each of them and went out.
Bond sipped his coffee and put it down. It was good,
but thick with grains. Kerim swallowed his at a gulp
and fitted a cigarette into his holder and lit it.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But there is nothing we can do about this love matter,’
Kerim continued, speaking half to himself. ‘We can
only wait and see. In the meantime there are other
things.’ He leant forward against the desk and looked
across at Bond, his eyes suddenly very hard and
shrewd.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There is something going on in the enemy camp, my
friend. It is not only this attempt to get rid of me. There
are comings and goings. I have few facts,’ he reached
up a big index finger and laid it alongside his nose, ‘but
I have this.’ He tapped the side of his nose as if he
was patting a dog. ‘But this is a good friend of mine
and I trust him.’ He brought his hand slowly and significantly
down on to the desk and added softly, ‘And if
the stakes were not so big, I would say to you, “Go
home my friend. Go home. There is something here to
get away from.” ’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim sat back. The tension went out of his voice.
He barked out a harsh laugh. ‘But we are not old women.
And this is our work. So let us forget my nose and get
on with the job. First of all, is there anything I can tell
you that you do not know? The girl has made no sign
of life since my signal and I have no other information.
But perhaps you would like to ask me some questions
about the meeting.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There’s only one thing I want to know,’ said Bond
flatly. ‘What do you think of this girl? Do you believe
her story or not? Her story about me? Nothing else
matters. If she hasn’t got some sort of a hysterical crush
on me, the whole business falls to the ground and it’s
some complicated MGB plot we can’t understand. Now.
Did you believe the girl?’ Bond’s voice was urgent and
his eyes searched the other man’s face.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ah, my friend,’ Kerim shook his head. He spread his
arms wide. ‘That is what I asked myself then, and it is
what I ask myself the whole time since. But who can tell
if a woman is lying about these things? Her eyes were
bright—those beautiful innocent eyes. Her lips were moist
and parted in that heavenly mouth. Her voice was urgent
and frightened at what she was doing and saying. Her
knuckles were white on the guard rail of the ship. But
what was in her heart?’ Kerim raised his hands, ‘God
alone knows.’ He brought his hands down resignedly. He
placed them flat on the desk and looked straight at Bond.
‘There is only one way of telling if a woman really loves
you, and even that way can only be read by an expert.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ said Bond dubiously. ‘I know what you mean.
In bed.’</p>
