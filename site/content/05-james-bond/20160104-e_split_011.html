<h2 id="calibre_toc_12" class="calibre8"><a id="Page_67" class="calibre9"></a>7. The Wizard of Ice</h2>

<p class="pindent">The two faces of the double clock in the shiny, domed
case looked out across the chessboard like the eyes of
some huge sea monster that had peered over the edge
of the table to watch the game.</p>

<p class="pindent">The two faces of the chess clock showed different
times. Kronsteen’s showed twenty minutes to one. The
long red pendulum that ticked off the seconds was
moving in its staccato sweep across the bottom half of
his clock’s face, while the enemy clock was silent and
its pendulum motionless down the face. But Makharov’s
clock said five minutes to one. He had wasted time in
the middle of the game and he now had only five
minutes to go. He was in bad ‘time-trouble’ and unless
Kronsteen made some lunatic mistake, which was
unthinkable, he was beaten.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kronsteen sat motionless and erect, as malevolently
inscrutable as a parrot. His elbows were on the table
and his big head rested on clenched fists that pressed
into his cheeks, squashing the pursed lips into a pout
of hauteur and disdain. Under the wide, bulging brow
the rather slanting black eyes looked down with deadly
calm on his winning board. But, behind the mask, the
blood was throbbing in the dynamo of his brain, and
a thick worm-like vein in his right temple pulsed at a
beat of over ninety. He had sweated away a pound of
weight in the last two hours and ten minutes, and the
spectre of a false move still had one hand at his throat.
But to Makharov, and to the spectators, he was still
‘The Wizard of Ice’ whose game had been compared
to a man eating fish. First he stripped off the skin,
then he picked out the bones, then he ate the fish.
Kronsteen had been Champion of Moscow two years
running, was now in the final for the third time and,
if he won this game, would be a contender for Grand
Mastership.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the pool of silence round the roped-off top table
there was no sound except the loud tripping feet of
Kronsteen’s clock. The two umpires sat motionless in
their raised chairs. They knew, as did Makharov, that this
was certainly the kill. Kronsteen had introduced a brilliant
twist into the Meran Variation of the Queen’s Gambit
Declined. Makharov had kept up with him until the 28th
move. He had lost time on that move. Perhaps he had
made a mistake there, and perhaps again on the 31st and
33rd moves. Who could say? It would be a game to be
debated all over Russia for weeks to come.</p>

<p class="pindent">There came a sigh from the crowded tiers opposite
the Championship game. Kronsteen had slowly removed
the right hand from his cheek and had stretched it
across the board. Like the pincers of a pink crab, his
thumb and forefinger had opened, then they had
descended. The hand, holding a piece, moved up and
sideways and down. Then the hand was slowly brought
back to the face.</p>

<p class="pindent">The spectators buzzed and whispered as they saw, on
the great wall map, the 41st move duplicated with a
shift of one of the three-foot placards. R-Kt8. That
must be the kill!</p>

<p class="pindent">Kronsteen reached deliberately over and pressed
down the lever at the bottom of his clock. His red
pendulum went dead. His clock showed a quarter to
one. At the same instant, Makharov’s pendulum came
to life and started its loud, inexorable beat.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kronsteen sat back. He placed his hands flat on the
table and looked coldly across at the glistening, lowered
face of the man whose guts he knew, for he too had
suffered defeat in his time, would be writhing in agony
like an eel pierced with a spear. Makharov, Champion
of Georgia. Well, tomorrow Comrade Makharov could
go back to Georgia and stay there. At any rate this
year he would not be moving with his family up to
Moscow.</p>

<p class="pindent">A man in plain clothes slipped under the ropes and
whispered to one of the umpires. He handed him a
white envelope. The umpire shook his head, pointing
at Makharov’s clock, which now said three minutes to
one. The man in plain clothes whispered one short
sentence which made the umpire sullenly bow his head.
He pinged a handbell.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There is an urgent personal message for Comrade
Kronsteen,’ he announced into the microphone. ‘There
will be a three minutes’ pause.’</p>

<p class="pindent">A mutter went round the hall. Even though Makharov
now courteously raised his eyes from the board and
sat immobile, gazing up into the recesses of the high,
vaulted ceiling, the spectators knew that the position
of the game was engraved on his brain. A three
minutes’ pause simply meant three extra minutes for
Makharov.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kronsteen felt the same stab of annoyance, but his
face was expressionless as the umpire stepped down
from his chair and handed him a plain, unaddressed
envelope. Kronsteen ripped it open with his thumb and
extracted the anonymous sheet of paper. It said, in the
large typewritten characters he knew so well, ‘<span class="sc">you are
required this instant</span>’. No signature and no
address.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kronsteen folded the paper and carefully placed it in
his inside breast pocket. Later it would be recovered
from him and destroyed. He looked up at the face of
the plain-clothes man standing beside the umpire. The
eyes were watching him impatiently, commandingly. To
hell with these people, thought Kronsteen. He would
<span class="it">not</span> resign with only three minutes to go. It was unthinkable.
It was an insult to the People’s Sport. But, as he
made a gesture to the umpire that the game could
continue, he trembled inside, and he avoided the eyes
of the plain-clothes man who remained standing, in
coiled immobility, inside the ropes.</p>

<p class="pindent">The bell pinged. ‘The game proceeds.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Makharov slowly bent down his head. The hand of
his clock slipped past the hour and he was still alive.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kronsteen continued to tremble inside. What he had
done was unheard of in an employee of <span class="sc">smersh</span>, or
of any other State agency. He would certainly be
reported. Gross disobedience. Dereliction of duty. What
might be the consequences? At the best a tongue-lashing
from General G., and a black mark on his zapiska. At
the worst? Kronsteen couldn’t imagine. He didn’t like
to think. Whatever happened, the sweets of victory had
turned bitter in his mouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">But now it was the end. With five seconds to go on
his clock, Makharov raised his whipped eyes no higher
than the pouting lips of his opponent and bent his head
in the brief, formal bow of surrender. At the double
ping of the umpire’s bell, the crowded hall rose to its
feet with a thunder of applause.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kronsteen stood up and bowed to his opponent, to
the umpires, and finally, deeply, to the spectators. Then,
with the plain-clothes man in his wake, he ducked under
the ropes and fought his way coldly and rudely through
the mass of his clamouring admirers towards the main
exit.</p>

<p class="pindent">Outside the Tournament Hall, in the middle of the
wide Pushkin Ulitza, with its engine running, stood the
usual anonymous black ZIK saloon. Kronsteen climbed
into the back and shut the door. As the plain-clothes
man jumped on to the running-board and squeezed
into the front seat, the driver crashed his gears and the
car tore off down the street.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kronsteen knew it would be a waste of breath to
apologize to the plain-clothes guard. It would also be
contrary to discipline. After all, he was Head of the
Planning Department of <span class="sc">smersh</span>, with the honorary
rank of full Colonel. And his brain was worth diamonds
to the organization. Perhaps he could argue his way out
of the mess. He gazed out of the window at the dark
streets, already wet with the work of the night cleaning
squad, and bent his mind to his defence. Then there
came a straight street at the end of which the moon
rode fast between the onion spires of the Kremlin, and
they were there.</p>

<p class="pindent">When the guard handed Kronsteen over to the ADC,
he also handed the ADC a slip of paper. The ADC
glanced at it and looked coldly up at Kronsteen with half-raised
eyebrows. Kronsteen looked calmly back without
saying anything. The ADC shrugged his shoulders and
picked up the office telephone and announced him.</p>

<p class="pindent">When they went into the big room and Kronsteen
had been waved to a chair and had nodded acknowledgment
of the brief pursed smile of Colonel Klebb, the
ADC went up to General G. and handed him the piece
of paper. The General read it and looked hard across
at Kronsteen. While the ADC walked to the door and
went out, the General went on looking at Kronsteen.
When the door was shut, General G. opened his mouth
and said softly, ‘Well, Comrade?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kronsteen was calm. He knew the story that would
appeal. He spoke quietly and with authority. ‘To the
public, Comrade General, I am a professional chess
player. Tonight I became Champion of Moscow for the
third year in succession. If, with only three minutes to
go, I had received a message that my wife was being
murdered outside the door of the Tournament Hall, I
would not have raised a finger to save her. My public
know that. They are as dedicated to the game as myself.
Tonight, if I had resigned the game and had come
immediately on receipt of that message, five thousand
people would have known that it could only be on the
orders of such a department as this. There would have
been a storm of gossip. My future goings and comings
would have been watched for clues. It would have been
the end of my cover. In the interests of State Security,
I waited three minutes before obeying the order. Even
so, my hurried departure will be the subject of much
comment. I shall have to say that one of my children
is gravely ill. I shall have to put a child into hospital for
a week to support the story. I deeply apologize for the
delay in carrying out the order. But the decision was a
difficult one. I did what I thought best in the interests
of the Department.’</p>

<p class="pindent">General G. looked thoughtfully into the dark slanting
eyes. The man was guilty, but the defence was good.
He read the paper again as if weighing up the size of
the offence, then he took out his lighter and burned it.
He dropped the last burning corner on to the glass top
of his desk and blew the ashes sideways on to the floor.
He said nothing to reveal his thoughts, but the burning
of the evidence was all that mattered to Kronsteen.
Now nothing could go on his zapiska. He was deeply
relieved and grateful. He would bend all his ingenuity
to the matter on hand. The General had performed an
act of great clemency. Kronsteen would repay him with
the full coin of his mind.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Pass over the photographs, Comrade Colonel,’ said
General G., as if the brief court-martial had not occurred.
‘The matter is as follows . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">So it is another death, thought Kronsteen, as the
General talked and he examined the dark ruthless face
that gazed levelly at him from the blown-up passport
photograph. While Kronsteen listened with half his
mind to what the General was saying, he picked out
the salient facts—English spy. Great scandal desired.
No Soviet involvement. Expert killer. Weakness for
women (therefore not homosexual, thought Kronsteen).
Drinks (but nothing is said about drugs). Unbribable
(who knows? There is a price for every man). No
expense would be spared. All equipment and personnel
available from all intelligence departments. Success to
be achieved within three months. Broad ideas required
now. Details to be worked out later.</p>

<p class="pindent">General G. fastened his sharp eyes on Colonel Klebb.
‘What are your immediate reactions, Comrade Colonel?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The square-cut rimless glass of the spectacles flashed
in the light of the chandelier as the woman straightened
from her position of bowed concentration and looked
across the desk at the General. The pale moist lips
below the sheen of nicotine-stained fur over the mouth
parted and started moving rapidly up and down as the
woman gave her views. To Kronsteen, watching the
face across the table, the square, expressionless opening
and shutting of the lips reminded him of the box-like
jabber of a puppet.</p>

<p class="pindent">The voice was hoarse and flat without emotion, ‘. . .
resembles in some respects the case of Stolzenberg. If
you remember, Comrade General, this also was a matter
of destroying a reputation as well as a life. On that
occasion the matter was simple. The spy was also a
pervert. If you recall . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kronsteen stopped listening. He knew all these cases.
He had handled the planning of most of them and
they were filed away in his memory like so many chess
gambits. Instead, with closed ears, he examined the face
of this dreadful woman and wondered casually how
much longer she would last in her job—how much
longer he would have to work with her.</p>

<p class="pindent">Dreadful? Kronsteen was not interested in human
beings—not even in his own children. Nor did the
categories of ‘good’ and ‘bad’ have a place in his vocabulary.
To him all people were chess pieces. He was only
interested in their reactions to the movements of other
pieces. To foretell their reactions, which was the greater
part of his job, one had to understand their individual
characteristics. Their basic instincts were immutable.
Self-preservation, sex and the instinct of the herd—in
that order. Their temperaments could be sanguine,
phlegmatic, choleric or melancholic. The temperament
of an individual would largely decide the comparative
strength of his emotions and his sentiments. Character
would greatly depend on upbringing and, whatever
Pavlov and the Behaviourists might say, to a certain
extent on the character of the parents. And, of course,
people’s lives and behaviour would be partly conditioned
by physical strengths and weaknesses.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was with these basic classifications at the back of
his mind that Kronsteen’s cold brain considered the
woman across the table. It was the hundredth time he
had summed her up, but now they had weeks of joint
work in front of them and it was as well to refresh the
memory so that a sudden intrusion of the human
element in their partnership should not come as a
surprise.</p>

<p class="pindent">Of course Rosa Klebb had a strong will to survive,
or she would not have become one of the most powerful
women in the State, and certainly the most feared. Her
rise, Kronsteen remembered, had begun with the
Spanish Civil War. Then, as a double agent inside
POUM—that is, working for the OGPU in Moscow
as well as for Communist Intelligence in Spain—she
had been the right hand, and some sort of a mistress,
they said, of her chief, the famous Andreas Nin. She
had worked with him from 1935-37. Then, on the orders
of Moscow, he was murdered and, it was rumoured,
murdered by her. Whether this was true or not, from
then on she had progressed slowly but straight up the
ladder of power, surviving setbacks, surviving wars,
surviving, because she forged no allegiances and joined
no factions, all the purges, until, in 1953, with the death
of Beria, the bloodstained hands grasped the rung, so
few from the very top, that was Head of the Operations
Department of <span class="sc">smersh</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">And, reflected Kronsteen, much of her success was
due to the peculiar nature of her next most important
instinct, the sex instinct. For Rosa Klebb undoubtedly
belonged to the rarest of all sexual types. She was a
neuter. Kronsteen was certain of it. The stories of men
and, yes, of women, were too circumstantial to be
doubted. She might enjoy the act physically, but the
instrument was of no importance. For her, sex was
nothing more than an itch. And this psychological and
physiological neutrality of hers at once relieved her of
so many human emotions and sentiments and desires.
Sexual neutrality was the essence of coldness in an
individual. It was a great and wonderful thing to be
born with.</p>

<p class="pindent">In her, the herd instinct would also be dead. Her urge
for power demanded that she should be a wolf and not
a sheep. She was a lone operator, but never a lonely one,
because the warmth of company was unnecessary to
her. And, of course, temperamentally, she would be a
phlegmatic—imperturbable, tolerant of pain, sluggish.
Laziness would be her besetting vice, thought Kronsteen.
She would be difficult to get out of her warm, hoggish
bed in the morning. Her private habits would be slovenly,
even dirty. It would not be pleasant, thought Kronsteen,
to look into the intimate side of her life, when she
relaxed, out of uniform. Kronsteen’s pouting lips curled
away from the thought and his mind hastened on, skipping
her character, which was certainly cunning and
strong, to her appearance.</p>

<p class="pindent">Rosa Klebb would be in her late forties, he assumed,
placing her by the date of the Spanish War. She was
short, about five foot four, and squat, and her dumpy
arms and short neck, and the calves of the thick legs
in the drab khaki stockings, were very strong for a
woman. The devil knows, thought Kronsteen, what her
breasts were like, but the bulge of uniform that rested
on the table-top looked like a badly packed sandbag,
and in general her figure, with its big pear-shaped hips,
could only be likened to a ’cello.</p>

<p class="pindent">The <span class="it">tricoteuses</span> of the French Revolution must have
had faces like hers, decided Kronsteen, sitting back in
his chair and tilting his head slightly to one side. The
thinning orange hair scraped back to the tight, obscene
bun; the shiny yellow-brown eyes that stared so coldly
at General G. through the sharp-edged squares of glass;
the wedge of thickly-powdered, large-pored nose; the
wet trap of a mouth, that went on opening and shutting
as if it was operated by wires under the chin.
Those French women, as they sat and knitted and
chatted while the guillotine clanged down, must have
had the same pale, thick chicken’s skin that scragged
in little folds under the eyes and at the corners of the
mouth and below the jaws, the same big peasant’s ears,
the same tight, hard dimpled fists, like knobkerries,
that, in the case of the Russian woman, now lay tightly
clenched on the red velvet table-top on either side of
the big bundle of bosom. And their faces must have
conveyed the same impression, concluded Kronsteen,
of coldness and cruelty and strength as this, yes, he
had to allow himself the emotive word, <span class="it">dreadful</span> woman
of <span class="sc">smersh</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thank you, Comrade Colonel. Your review of the
position is of value. And now, Comrade Kronsteen,
have you anything to add? Please be short. It is two
o’clock and we all have a heavy day before us.’ General
G.’s eyes, bloodshot with strain and lack of sleep, stared
fixedly across the desk into the fathomless brown pools
below the bulging forehead. There had been no need
to tell this man to be brief. Kronsteen never had much
to say, but each of his words was worth speeches from
the rest of the staff.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kronsteen had already made up his mind, or he would
not have allowed his thoughts to concentrate for so
long on the woman.</p>

<p class="pindent">He slowly tilted back his head and gazed into the
nothingness of the ceiling. His voice was extremely
mild, but it had the authority that commands close
attention.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Comrade General, it was a Frenchman, in some
respects a predecessor of yours, Fouché, who observed
that it is no good killing a man unless you also destroy
his reputation. It will, of course, be easy to kill this man
Bond. Any paid Bulgarian assassin would do it, if properly
instructed. The second part of the operation, the
destruction of this man’s character, is more important
and more difficult. At this stage it is only clear to me
that the deed must be done away from England, and
in a country over whose press and radio we have
influence. If you ask me how the man is to be got there,
I can only say that if the bait is important enough, and
its capture is open to this man alone, he will be sent to
seize it from wherever he may happen to be. To avoid
the appearance of a trap, I would consider giving the
bait a touch of eccentricity, of the unusual. The English
pride themselves on their eccentricity. They treat the
eccentric proposition as a challenge. I would rely partly
on this reading of their psychology to have them send
this important operator after the bait.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kronsteen paused. He lowered his head so that he
was looking just over General G.’s shoulder.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I shall proceed to devise such a trap,’ he said
indifferently. ‘For the present, I can only say that if the
bait is successful in attracting its prey, we are then likely
to require an assassin with a perfect command of the
English language.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kronsteen’s eyes moved to the red velvet table-top
in front of him. Thoughtfully, as if this was the kernel
of the problem, he added: ‘We shall also require a reliable
and extremely beautiful girl.’</p>
