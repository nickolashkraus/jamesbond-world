<p class="pindent">The taxi drew up at the Rue Cambon entrance to the
Ritz Hotel.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked at Nash’s watch. 11.45. He must be dead
punctual. He knew that if a Russian spy was even a few
minutes early or late for a rendezvous the rendezvous
was automatically cancelled. He paid off the taxi and
went through the door on the left that leads into the
Ritz bar.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond ordered a double vodka martini. He drank it
half down. He felt wonderful. Suddenly the last four
days, and particularly last night, were washed off the
calendar. Now he was on his own, having his private
adventure. All his duties had been taken care of. The girl
was sleeping in a bedroom at the Embassy. The Spektor,
still pregnant with explosive, had been taken away by the
bomb-disposal squad of the Deuxième Bureau. He had
spoken to his old friend René Mathis, now head of the
Deuxième, and the concierge at the Cambon entrance
to the Ritz had been told to give him a pass key and to
ask no questions.</p>

<p class="pindent">René had been delighted to find himself again
involved with Bond in <span class="it">une affaire noire</span>. ‘Have confidence,
<span class="it">cher</span> James,’ he had said. ‘I will execute your mysteries.
You can tell me the story afterwards. Two laundry-men
with a large laundry basket will come to Room 204 at
12.15. I shall accompany them dressed as the driver
of their camion. We are to fill the laundry basket and
take it to Orly and await an RAF Canberra which will
arrive at two o’clock. We hand over the basket. Some
dirty washing which was in France will be in England.
Yes?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Head of Station F had spoken to M on the scrambler.
He had passed over a short written report from
Bond. He had asked for the Canberra. No, he had no
idea what it was for. Bond had only shown up to
deliver the girl and the Spektor. He had eaten a huge
breakfast and had left the Embassy saying he would
be back after lunch.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked again at the time. He finished his martini.
He paid for it and walked out of the bar and up the
steps to the concierge’s lodge.</p>

<p class="pindent">The concierge looked sharply at him and handed over
a key. Bond walked over to the lift and got in and went
up to the third floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">The lift door clanged behind him. Bond walked softly
down the corridor, looking at the numbers.</p>

<p class="pindent">204. Bond put his right hand inside his coat and on
to the taped butt of the Beretta. It was tucked into the
waistband of his trousers. He could feel the metal of
the silencer warm across his stomach.</p>

<p class="pindent">He knocked once with his left hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Come in.’</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a quavering voice. An old woman’s voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond tried the handle of the door. It was unlocked.
He slipped the pass key into his coat-pocket. He pushed
the door open with one swift motion and stepped in
and shut it behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a typical Ritz sitting-room, extremely elegant,
with good Empire furniture. The walls were white and
the curtains and chair covers were of a small patterned
chintz of red roses on white. The carpet was wine-red
and close-fitted.</p>

<p class="pindent">In a pool of sunshine, in a low armed chair beside a
Directoire writing desk, a little old woman sat knitting.</p>

<p class="pindent">The tinkle of the steel needles continued. The eyes
behind light-blue tinted bifocals examined Bond with
polite curiosity.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Oui, Monsieur?</span>’ The voice was deep and hoarse. The
thickly powdered, rather puffy face under the white hair
showed nothing but well-bred interest.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s hand on the gun under his coat was taut as
a steel spring. His half-closed eyes flickered round the
room and back to the little old woman in the chair.</p>

<p class="pindent">Had he made a mistake? Was this the wrong room?
Should he apologize and get out? Could this woman
possibly belong to <span class="sc">smersh</span>? She looked so exactly like
the sort of respectable rich widow one would expect
to find sitting by herself in the Ritz, whiling the time
away with her knitting. The sort of woman who would
have her own table, and her favourite waiter, in a corner
of the restaurant downstairs—not, of course, the grill
room. The sort of woman who would doze after lunch
and then be fetched by an elegant black limousine with
white side-walled tyres and be driven to the tea room
in the rue de Berri to meet some other rich crone. The
old-fashioned black dress with the touch of lace at the
throat and wrists, the thin gold chain that hung down
over the shapeless bosom and ended in a folding lorgnette,
the neat little feet in the sensible black-buttoned boots
that barely touched the floor. It couldn’t be Klebb! Bond
had got the number of the room wrong. He could feel
the perspiration under his arms. But now he would have
to play the scene through.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My name is Bond, James Bond.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And I, Monsieur, am the Comtesse Metterstein. What
can I do for you?’ The French was rather thick. She
might be German Swiss. The needles tinkled busily.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I am afraid Captain Nash has met with an accident.
He won’t be coming today. So I came instead.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Did the eyes narrow a fraction behind the pale blue
spectacles?</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I have not the pleasure of the Captain’s acquaintance,
Monsieur. Nor of yours. Please sit down and state your
business.’ The woman inclined her head an inch towards
the high-backed chair beside the writing desk.</p>

<p class="pindent">One couldn’t fault her. The graciousness of it all was
devastating. Bond walked across the room and sat down.
Now he was about six feet away from her. The desk
held nothing but a tall old-fashioned telephone with a
receiver on a hook, and, within reach of her hand, an
ivory-buttoned bellpush. The black mouth of the telephone
yawned at Bond politely.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stared rudely into the woman’s face, examining
it. It was an ugly face, toadlike, under the powder and
under the tight cottage-loaf of white hair. The eyes
were so light brown as to be almost yellow. The pale
lips were wet and blubbery below the fringe of nicotine-stained
moustache. Nicotine? Where were her cigarettes?
There was no ashtray—no smell of smoke in the
room.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s hand tightened again on his gun. He glanced
down at the bag of knitting, at the shapeless length of
small-denier beige wool the woman was working on.
The steel needles. What was there odd about them? The
ends were discoloured as if they had been held in fire.
Did knitting needles ever look like that?</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Eh bien, Monsieur?</span>’ Was there an edge to the voice?
Had she read something in his face?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled. His muscles were tense, waiting for any
movement, any trick. ‘It’s no use,’ he said cheerfully,
gambling. ‘You are Rosa Klebb. And you are Head of
Otdyel II of <span class="sc">smersh</span>. You are a torturer and a murderer.
You wanted to kill me and the Romanov girl. I am very
glad to meet you at last.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The eyes had not changed. The harsh voice was
patient and polite. The woman reached out her left hand
towards the bellpush. ‘Monsieur, I am afraid you are
deranged. I must ring for the <span class="it">valet de chambre</span> and have
you shown to the door.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond never knew what saved his life. Perhaps it
was the flash of realization that no wires led from
the bellpush to the wall or into the carpet. Perhaps
it was the sudden memory of the English ‘Come in’
when the expected knock came on the door. But, as
her finger reached the ivory knob, he hurled himself
sideways out of the chair.</p>

<p class="pindent">As Bond hit the ground there was a sharp noise of
tearing calico. Splinters from the back of his chair
sprayed around him. The chair crashed to the floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond twisted over, tugging at his gun. Out of the
corner of his eye he noticed a curl of blue smoke coming
from the mouth of the ‘telephone’. Then the woman
was on him, the knitting needles glinting in her clenched
fists.</p>

<p class="pindent">She stabbed downwards at his legs. Bond lashed out
with his feet and hurled her sideways. She had aimed
at his legs! As he got to one knee, Bond knew what the
coloured tips of the needles meant. It was poison.
Probably one of those German nerve poisons. All she
had to do was scratch him, even through his clothes.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was on his feet. She was coming at him again.
He tugged furiously at his gun. The silencer had
caught. There was a flash of light. Bond dodged. One
of the needles rattled against the wall behind him and
the dreadful chunk of woman, the white bun of wig
askew on her head, the slimy lips drawn back from
her teeth, was on top of him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond, not daring to use his naked fists against the
needles, vaulted sideways over the desk.</p>

<p class="pindent">Panting and talking to herself in Russian, Rosa Klebb
scuttled round the desk, the remaining needle held
forward like a rapier. Bond backed away, working at the
stuck gun. The back of his legs came against a small
chair. He let go the gun and reached behind him and
snatched it up. Holding it by the back, with its legs
pointing like horns, he went round the desk to meet
her. But she was beside the bogus telephone. She swept
it up and aimed it. Her hand went to the button. Bond
leapt forward. He crashed the chair down. Bullets
sprayed into the ceiling and plaster pattered down on
his head.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond lunged again. The legs of the chair clutched
the woman round the waist and over her shoulders.
God she was strong! She gave way, but only to the wall.
There she held her ground, spitting at Bond over the
top of the chair, while the knitting needle quested
towards him like a long scorpion’s sting.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stood back a little, holding the chair at arms’
length. He took aim and high-kicked at the probing
wrist. The needle sailed away into the room and pinged
down behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond came in closer. He examined the position. Yes,
the woman was held firmly against the wall by the four
legs of the chair. There was no way she could get out
of the cage except by brute force. Her arms and legs
and head were free, but the body was pinned to the
wall.</p>

<p class="pindent">The woman hissed something in Russian. She spat
at him over the chair. Bond bent his head and wiped
his face against his sleeve. He looked up and into the
mottled face.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s all, Rosa,’ he said. ‘The Deuxième will be here
in a minute. In an hour or so you’ll be in London. You
won’t be seen leaving the hotel. You won’t be seen going
into England. In fact very few people will see you again.
From now on you’re just a number on a secret file. By
the time we’ve finished with you you’ll be ready for the
lunatic asylum.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The face, a few feet away, was changing. Now the
blood had drained out of it, and it was yellow. But not,
thought Bond, with fear. The pale eyes looked levelly
into his. They were not defeated.</p>

<p class="pindent">The wet, shapeless mouth lengthened in a grin.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And where will you be when I am in the asylum, Mister
Bond?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, getting on with my life.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I think not, Angliski spion.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond hardly noticed the words. He had heard the
click of the door opening. A burst of laughter came
from the room behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Eh bien</span>,’ it was the voice of delight that Bond remembered
so well. ‘The 70th position! Now, at last, I have
seen everything. And invented by an Englishman! James,
this really is an insult to my countrymen.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I don’t recommend it,’ said Bond over his shoulder.
‘It’s too strenuous. Anyway, you can take over now. I’ll
introduce you. Her name’s Rosa. You’ll like her. She’s
a big noise in <span class="sc">smersh</span>—she looks after the murdering,
as a matter of fact.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis came up. There were two laundry-men with
him. The three of them stood and looked respectfully
into the dreadful face.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Rosa,’ said Mathis thoughtfully. ‘But, this time, a Rosa
Malheur. Well, well! But I am sure she is uncomfortable
in that position. You two, bring along the <span class="it">panier de fleurs</span>—she
will be more comfortable lying down.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The two men walked to the door. Bond heard the
creak of the laundry basket.</p>

<p class="pindent">The woman’s eyes were still locked in Bond’s. She moved
a little, shifting her weight. Out of Bond’s sight, and not
noticed by Mathis, who was still examining her face, the
toe of one shiny buttoned boot pressed under the instep
of the other. From the point of its toe there slid forward
half an inch of thin knife blade. Like the knitting needles,
the steel had a dirty bluish tinge.</p>

<p class="pindent">The two men came up and put the big square basket
down beside Mathis.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Take her,’ said Mathis. He bowed slightly to the
woman. ‘It has been an honour.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Au revoir</span>, Rosa,’ said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">The yellow eyes blazed briefly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Farewell, Mister Bond.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The boot, with its tiny steel tongue, flashed out.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond felt a sharp pain in his right calf. It was only
the sort of pain you would get from a kick. He flinched
and stepped back. The two men seized Rosa Klebb by
the arms.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis laughed. ‘My poor James,’ he said, ‘Count on
<span class="sc">smersh</span> to have the last word.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The tongue of dirty steel had withdrawn into the
leather. Now it was only a harmless bundle of old
woman that was being lifted into the basket.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis watched the lid being secured. He turned to
Bond. ‘It is a good day’s work you have done, my friend,’
he said. ‘But you look tired. Go back to the Embassy
and have a rest because this evening we must have
dinner together. The best dinner in Paris. And I will
find the loveliest girl to go with it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Numbness was creeping up Bond’s body. He felt very
cold. He lifted his hand to brush back the comma of
hair over his right eyebrow. There was no feeling in his
fingers. They seemed as big as cucumbers. His hand
fell heavily to his side.</p>

<p class="pindent">Breathing became difficult. Bond sighed to the depth
of his lungs. He clenched his jaws and half closed his
eyes, as people do when they want to hide their drunkenness.</p>

<p class="pindent">Through his eyelashes he watched the basket being
carried to the door. He prised his eyes open. Desperately
he focused Mathis.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I shan’t need a girl, René,’ he said thickly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now he had to gasp for breath. Again his hand moved
up towards his cold face. He had an impression of
Mathis starting towards him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond felt his knees begin to buckle.</p>

<p class="pindent">He said, or thought he said, ‘I’ve already got the
loveliest . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond pivoted slowly on his heel and crashed headlong
to the wine-red floor.</p>
