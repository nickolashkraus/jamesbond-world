<p class="pindent">Back in the cool office, while they waited for the
inevitable coffee, Kerim opened a cupboard in the wall
and pulled out sets of engineers’ blue overalls. Kerim
stripped to his shorts and dressed himself in one of
the suits and pulled on a pair of rubber boots. Bond
picked out a suit and a pair of boots that more or less
fitted him and put them on.</p>

<p class="pindent">With the coffee, the head clerk brought in two
powerful flashlights which he put on the desk.</p>

<p class="pindent">When the clerk had left the room Kerim said, ‘He is
one of my sons—the eldest one. The others in there
are all my children. The chauffeur and the watchman are
uncles of mine. Common blood is the best security. And
this spice business is good cover for us all. M set me
up in it. He spoke to friends of his in the City of London.
I am now the leading spice merchant in Turkey. I have
long ago repaid M the money that was lent me. My
children are shareholders in the business. They have a
good life. When there is secret work to be done and I
need help, I choose the child who will be most suitable.
They all have training in different secret things. They are
clever and brave. Some have already killed for me. They
would all die for me—and for M. I have taught them
he is just below God.’ Kerim made a deprecating wave.
‘But that is just to tell you that you are in good
hands.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I hadn’t imagined anything different.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ha!’ said Kerim non-committally. He picked up the
torches and handed one to Bond. ‘And now to work.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim walked over to the wide glass-fronted bookcase
and put his hand behind it. There was a click and
the bookcase rolled silently and easily along the wall
to the left. Behind it was a small door, flush with the
wall. Kerim pressed one side of the door and it swung
inwards to reveal a dark tunnel with stone steps leading
straight down. A dank smell, mixed with a faint zoo
stench, came out into the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You go first,’ said Kerim. ‘Go down the steps to the
bottom and wait. I must fix the door.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond switched on his torch and stepped through the
opening and went carefully down the stairs. The light
of the torch showed fresh masonry, and, twenty feet
below, a glimmer of water. When Bond got to the
bottom he found that the glimmer was a small stream
running down a central gutter in the floor of an ancient
stone-walled tunnel that sloped steeply up to the right.
To the left, the tunnel went on downwards and would,
he guessed, come out below the surface of the Golden
Horn.</p>

<p class="pindent">Out of range of Bond’s light there was a steady,
quiet, scuttling sound, and in the blackness hundreds
of pinpoints of red light flickered and moved. It was
the same uphill and downhill. Twenty yards away on
either side, a thousand rats were looking at Bond. They
were sniffing at his scent. Bond imagined the whiskers
lifting slightly from their teeth. He had a quick moment
of wondering what action they would take if his torch
went out.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim was suddenly beside him. ‘It is a long climb. A
quarter of an hour. I hope you love animals,’ Kerim’s
laugh boomed hugely away up the tunnel. The rats
scuffled and stirred. ‘Unfortunately there is not much
choice. Rats and bats. Squadrons of them, divisions—a
whole air force and army. And we have to drive them in
front of us. Towards the end of the climb it becomes
quite congested. Let’s get started. The air is good. It is dry
underfoot on both sides of the stream. But in winter the
floods come and then we have to use frogmen’s suits. Keep
your torch on my feet. If a bat gets in your hair, brush
him off. It will not be often. Their radar is very good.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They set off up the steep slope. The smell of the rats
and of the droppings of bats was thick—a mixture of
monkey house and chicken battery. It occurred to Bond
that it would be days before he got rid of it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Clusters of bats hung like bunches of withered
grapes from the roof and when, from time to time,
either Kerim’s head or Bond’s brushed against them,
they exploded twittering into the darkness. Ahead of
them as they climbed there was the forest of squeaking,
scuffling red pinpoints that grew denser on both sides
of the central gutter. Occasionally Kerim flashed his
torch forward and the light shone on a grey field sown
with glittering teeth and glinting whiskers. When this
happened, an extra frenzy seized the rats, and those
nearest jumped on the backs of the others to get
away. All the while, fighting tumbling grey bodies
came sweeping down the central gutter and, as the
pressure of the mass higher up the tunnel grew
heavier, the frothing rear rank came closer.</p>

<p class="pindent">The two men kept their torches levelled like guns on
the rear ranks until, after a good quarter of an hour’s
climb, they reached their destination.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a deep alcove of newly faced brick in the side
wall of the tunnel. There were two benches on each
side of a thick tarpaulin-wrapped object that came down
from the ceiling of the alcove.</p>

<p class="pindent">They stepped inside. Another few yards’ climb, Bond
thought, and mass hysteria must have seized the distant
thousands of rats further up the tunnel. The horde
would have turned. Out of sheer pressure for space,
the rats would have braved the lights and hurled themselves
down on to the two intruders, in spite of the
two glaring eyes and the threatening scent.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Watch,’ said Kerim.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a moment of silence. Further up the tunnel
the squeaking had stopped, as if at a word of command.
Then suddenly the tunnel was a foot deep in a great wave
of hurtling, scrambling grey bodies as, with a continuous
high-pitched squeal, the rats turned and pelted back down
the slope.</p>

<p class="pindent">For minutes the sleek grey river foamed by outside the
alcove until at last the numbers thinned and only a trickle
of sick or wounded rats came limping and probing their
way down the tunnel floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">The scream of the horde slowly vanished down
towards the river, until there was silence except for the
occasional twitter of a fleeing bat.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim gave a non-committal grunt. ‘One of these
days those rats will start dying. Then we shall have the
plague in Istanbul again. Sometimes I feel guilty for not
telling the authorities of this tunnel so that they can
clean the place up. But I can’t so long as the Russians
are up here.’ He jerked his head at the roof. He looked
at his watch. ‘Five minutes to go. They will be pulling
up their chairs and fiddling with their papers. There will
be the three permanent men—MGB, or one of them
may be from army intelligence, GRU. And there will
probably be three others. Two came in a fortnight ago,
one through Greece and another through Persia.
Another one arrived on Monday. God knows who they
are, or what they are here for. And sometimes the girl,
Tatiana, comes in with a signal and goes out again. Let
us hope we will see her today. You will be impressed.
She is something.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim reached up and untied the tarpaulin cover and
pulled it downwards. Bond understood. The cover
protected the shining butt of a submarine periscope,
fully withdrawn. The moisture glistened on the thick
grease of the exposed bottom joint. Bond chuckled.
‘Where the hell did you get that from, Darko?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Turkish Navy. War surplus.’ Kerim’s voice did not
invite further questions. ‘Now Q Branch in London is
trying to fix some way of wiring the damn thing for
sound. It’s not going to be easy. The lens at the top of
this is no bigger than a cigarette-lighter, end on. When
I raise it, it comes up to floor level in their room. In
the corner of the room where it comes up, we cut a
small mousehole. We did it well. Once when I came to
have a look, the first thing I saw was a big mousetrap
with a piece of cheese on it. At least it looked big
through the lens.’ Kerim laughed briefly. ‘But there’s
not much room to fit a sensitive pick-up alongside the
lens. And there’s no hope of getting in again to do any
more fiddling about with their architecture. The only
way I managed to install this thing was to get my friends
in the Public Works Ministry to turn the Russians out
for a few days. The story was that the trams going up
the hill were shaking the foundations of the houses.
There had to be a survey. It cost me a few hundred
pounds for the right pockets. The Public Works
inspected half a dozen houses on either side of this
one and declared the place safe. By that time, I and the
family had finished our construction work. The Russians
were suspicious as hell. I gather they went over the
place with a toothcomb when they got back, looking
for microphones and bombs and so on. But we can’t
work that trick twice. Unless Q Branch can think up
something very clever, I shall have to be content with
keeping an eye on them. One of these days they’ll give
away something useful. They’ll be interrogating someone
we’re interested in or something of that sort.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Alongside the matrix of the periscope in the roof
of the alcove there was a pendulous blister of metal,
twice the size of a football. ‘What’s that?’ said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Bottom half of a bomb—a big bomb. If anything
happens to me, or if war breaks out with Russia, that
bomb will be set off by radio-control from my office.
It is sad [Kerim didn’t look sad] but I fear that many
innocent people will get killed besides the Russians.
When the blood is on the boil, man is as unselective as
nature.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim had been polishing away at the hooded
eyepieces between the two handlebars that stuck out
on both sides of the base of the periscope. Now he
glanced at his watch and bent down and gripped the
two handles and slowly brought them up level with his
chin. There was a hiss of hydraulics as the glistening
stem of the periscope slid up into its steel sheath in
the roof of the alcove. Kerim bent his head and gazed
into the eyepieces and slowly inched up the handles
until he could stand upright. He twisted gently. He
centred the lens and beckoned to Bond. ‘Just the six
of them.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond moved over and took the handles.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Have a good look at them,’ said Kerim. ‘I know
them, but you’d better get their faces in your mind.
Head of the table is their Resident Director. On his
left are his two staff. Opposite them are the three new
ones. The latest, who looks quite an important chap, is
on the Director’s right. Tell me if they do anything
except talk.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s first impulse was to tell Kerim not to make
so much noise. It was as if he was in the room with
the Russians, as if he were sitting in a chair in the
corner, a secretary perhaps, taking shorthand of the
conference.</p>

<p class="pindent">The wide, all-round lens, designed for spotting aircraft
as well as surface ships, gave him a curious picture—a
mouse’s eye view of a forest of legs below the fore-edge
of the table, and various aspects of the heads belonging
to the legs. The Director and his two colleagues were
clear—serious dull Russian faces whose characteristics
Bond filed away. There was the studious, professorial
face of the Director—thick spectacles, lantern jaw, big
forehead and thin hair brushed back. On his left was a
square wooden face with deep clefts on either side of
the nose, fair hair <span class="it">en brosse</span> and a nick out of the left ear.
The third member of the permanent staff had a shifty
Armenian face with clever bright almond eyes. He was
talking now. His face wore a falsely humble look. Gold
glinted in his mouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond could see less of the three visitors. Their backs
were half towards him and only the profile of the
nearest, and presumably most junior, showed clearly.
This man’s skin also was dark. He too would be from
one of the southern republics. The jaw was badly shaved
and the eye in profile was bovine and dull under a thick
black brow. The nose was fleshy and porous. The upper
lip was long over a sullen mouth and the beginning of
a double chin. The tough black hair was cut very short
so that most of the back of the neck looked blue to
the level of the tips of the ears. It was a military haircut,
done with mechanical clippers.</p>

<p class="pindent">The only clues to the next man were an angry boil
on the back of a fat bald neck, a shiny blue suit and
rather bright brown shoes. The man was motionless
during the whole period that Bond kept watch and
apparently never spoke.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now the senior visitor, on the right of the Resident
Director, sat back and began talking. It was a strong,
crag-like profile with big bones and a jutting chin under
a heavy brown moustache of Stalin cut. Bond could
see one cold grey eye under a bushy eyebrow and a low
forehead topped by wiry grey-brown hair. This man
was the only one who was smoking. He puffed busily
at a tiny wooden pipe in the bowl of which stood half
a cigarette. Every now and then he shook the pipe
sideways so that the ash fell on the floor. His profile
had more authority than any of the other faces and
Bond guessed that he was a senior man sent down from
Moscow.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s eyes were getting tired. He twisted the handles
gently and looked round the office as far as the blurring
jagged edges of the mousehole would allow. He saw
nothing of interest—two olive green filing cabinets, a
hatstand by the door, on which he counted six more
or less identical grey Homburgs, and a sideboard with
a heavy carafe of water and some glasses. Bond stood
away from the eyepiece, rubbing his eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If only we could hear,’ Kerim said, shaking his head
sadly. ‘It would be worth diamonds.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It would solve a lot of problems,’ agreed Bond. Then,
‘By the way Darko, how did you come on this tunnel?
What was it built for?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim bent and gave a quick glance into the eyepieces
and straightened up.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s a lost drain from the Hall of Pillars,’ he said.
‘The Hall of Pillars is now a thing for tourists. It’s up
above us on the heights of Istanbul, near St Sophia.
A thousand years ago it was built as a reservoir in case
of siege. It’s a huge underground palace, a hundred
yards long and about half as broad. It was made to
hold millions of gallons of water. It was discovered
again about four hundred years ago by a man called
Gyllius. One day I was reading his account of finding
it. He said it was filled in winter from “<span class="it">a great pipe with
a mighty noise</span>”. It occurred to me that there might be
another “<span class="it">great pipe</span>” to empty it quickly if the city fell
to the enemy. I went up to the Hall of Pillars and
bribed the watchman and rowed about among the
pillars all one night in a rubber dinghy with one of my
boys. We went over the walls with a hammer and an
echo-sounder. At one end, in the most likely spot, there
was a hollow sound. I handed out more money to the
Minister of Public Works and he closed the place for
a week—“for cleaning”. My little team got busy.’ Kerim
ducked down again for a look through the eyepieces
and went on. ‘We dug into the wall above water-level
and came on the top of an arch. The arch was the
beginning of a tunnel. We got into the tunnel and went
down it. Quite exciting, not knowing where we were
going to come out. And, of course, it went straight
down the hill—under the Street of Books where the
Russians have their place, and out into the Golden
Horn, by the Galata Bridge, twenty yards away from
my warehouse. So we filled in our hole in the Hall of
Pillars and started digging from my end. That was two
years ago. It took us a year and a lot of survey work
to get directly under the Russians.’ Kerim laughed. ‘And
now I suppose one of these days the Russians will
decide to change their offices. By then I hope someone
else will be Head of T.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim bent down to the rubber eyepieces. Bond saw
him stiffen. Kerim said urgently, ‘The door’s opening.
Quick. Take over. Here she comes.’</p>
