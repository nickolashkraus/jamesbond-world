<p class="pindent">To make the contact easy, Bond went out and stood in
the corridor. He ran over the details of the code of the
day, the few harmless phrases, changed on the first of
each month, that served as a simple recognition signal
between English agents.</p>

<p class="pindent">The train gave a jerk and moved slowly out into the
sunshine. At the end of the corridor the communicating
door slammed. There was no sound of steps, but
suddenly the red and gold face was mirrored in the
window.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Excuse me. Could I borrow a match?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I use a lighter.’ Bond produced his battered Ronson
and handed it over.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Better still.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Until they go wrong.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked up into the man’s face, expecting a smile
at the completion of the childish ‘Who goes there? Pass,
Friend’ ritual.</p>

<p class="pindent">The thick lips writhed briefly. There was no light in
the very pale blue eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man had taken off his mackintosh. He was
wearing an old reddish-brown tweed coat with his
flannel trousers, a pale yellow Viyella summer shirt,
and the dark blue and red zigzagged tie of the Royal
Engineers. It was tied with a Windsor knot. Bond
mistrusted anyone who tied his tie with a Windsor
knot. It showed too much vanity. It was often the mark
of a cad. Bond decided to forget his prejudice. A gold
signet ring, with an indecipherable crest, glinted on the
little finger of the right hand that gripped the guard
rail. The corner of a red bandana handkerchief flopped
out of the breast pocket of the man’s coat. On his left
wrist there was a battered silver wrist-watch with an
old leather strap.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond knew the type—a minor public school and
then caught up by the war. Field Security perhaps. No
idea what to do afterwards, so he stayed with the occupation
troops. At first he would have been with the
military police, then, as the senior men drifted home,
there came promotion into one of the security services.
Moved to Trieste where he did well enough. Wanted to
stay on and avoid the rigours of England. Probably had
a girl friend, or had married an Italian. The Secret
Service had needed a man for the small post that Trieste
had become after the withdrawal. This man was available.
They took him on. He would be doing routine
jobs—have some low-grade sources in the Italian and
Yugoslav police, and their intelligence networks. A thousand
a year. A good life, without much being expected
from him. Then, out of the blue, this had come along.
Must have been a shock getting one of those Most
Immediate signals. He’d probably be a bit shy of Bond.
Odd face. The eyes looked rather mad. But so they did
in most of these men doing secret work abroad. One
had to be a bit mad to take it on. Powerful chap, probably
on the stupid side, but useful for this kind of guard
work. M had just taken the nearest man and told him
to join the train.</p>

<p class="pindent">All this went through Bond’s mind as he photographed
an impression of the man’s clothes and general
appearance. Now he said, ‘Glad to see you. How did it
happen?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Got a signal. Late last night. Personal from M. Shook
me I can tell you, old man.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Curious accent. What was it? A hint of brogue—cheap
brogue. And something else Bond couldn’t define. Probably
came from living too long abroad and talking
foreign languages all the time. And that dreadful ‘old
man’ at the end. Shyness.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Must have,’ said Bond sympathetically. ‘What did
it say?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Just told me to get on the Orient this morning and
contact a man and a girl in the through carriage. More
or less described what you look like. Then I was to stick
by you and see you both through to Gay Paree. That’s
all, old man.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Was there defensiveness in the voice? Bond glanced
sideways. The pale eyes swivelled to meet his. There was
a quick red glare in them. It was as if the safety door
of a furnace had swung open. The blaze died. The door
to the inside of the man was banged shut. Now the eyes
were opaque again—the eyes of an introvert, of a man
who rarely looks out into the world but is for ever
surveying the scene inside him.</p>

<p class="pindent">There’s madness there all right, thought Bond, startled
by the sight of it. Shell-shock perhaps, or
schizophrenia. Poor chap, with that magnificent body.
One day he would certainly crack. The madness would
take control. Bond had better have a word to Personnel.
Check up on his medical. By the way, what was his
name?</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well I’m very glad to have you along. Probably not
much for you to do. We started off with three Redland
men on our tail. They’ve been got rid of, but there may
be others on the train. Or some more may get on. And
I’ve got to get this girl to London without trouble. If
you’d just hang about. Tonight we’d better stay together
and share watches. It’s the last night and I don’t want
to take any chances. By the way, my name’s James Bond.
Travelling as David Somerset. And that’s Caroline
Somerset in there.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The man fished in his inside pocket and produced a
battered notecase which seemed to contain plenty of
money. He extracted a visiting card and handed it to
Bond. It said ‘Captain Norman Nash’, and, in the left-hand
bottom corner, ‘Royal Automobile Club’.</p>

<p class="pindent">As Bond put the card in his pocket he slipped his
finger across it. It was engraved. ‘Thanks,’ he said. ‘Well,
Nash, come and meet Mrs Somerset. No reason why
we shouldn’t travel more or less together.’ He smiled
encouragingly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Again the red glare quickly extinguished. The lips
writhed under the young golden moustache. ‘Delighted,
old man.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned to the door and knocked softly and
spoke his name.</p>

<p class="pindent">The door opened. Bond beckoned Nash in and shut
the door behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl looked surprised.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘This is Captain Nash, Norman Nash. He’s been told
to keep an eye on us.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How do you do.’ The hand came out hesitantly. The
man touched it briefly. His stare was fixed. He said
nothing. The girl gave an embarrassed little laugh, ‘Won’t
you sit down?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Er, thank you.’ Nash sat stiffly on the edge of the
banquette. He seemed to remember something, something
one did when one had nothing to say. He groped
in the side pocket of his coat and produced a packet of
Players. ‘Will you have a, er, cigarette?’ He prized open
the top with a fairly clean thumbnail, stripped down the
silver paper and pushed out the cigarettes. The girl took
one. Nash’s other hand flashed forward a lighter with
the obsequious speed of a motor salesman.</p>

<p class="pindent">Nash looked up. Bond was standing leaning against
the door and wondering how to help this clumsy, embarrassed
man. Nash held out the cigarettes and the lighter
as if he was offering glass beads to a native chief. ‘What
about you, old man?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thanks,’ said Bond. He hated Virginia tobacco, but
he was prepared to do anything to help put the man at
ease. He took a cigarette and lit it. They certainly had
to make do with some queer fish in the Service nowadays.
How the devil did this man manage to get along
in the semi-diplomatic society he would have to frequent
in Trieste?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said lamely. ‘You look very fit, Nash. Tennis?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Swimming.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Been long in Trieste?’</p>

<p class="pindent">There came the brief red glare. ‘About three years.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Interesting work?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sometimes. You know how it is, old man.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond wondered how he could stop Nash calling him
‘old man’. He couldn’t think of a way. Silence fell.</p>

<p class="pindent">Nash obviously felt it was his turn again. He fished
in his pocket and produced a newspaper cutting. It was
the front page of the <span class="it">Corriere de la Sera</span>. He handed it
to Bond. ‘Seen this, old man?’ The eyes blazed and
died.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was the front-page lead. The thick black lettering
on the cheap newsprint was still wet. The headlines
said:</p>

<div class="lgc"> <!-- rend=';sc;' -->
<p class="line6">terribile esplosione in istanbul</p>
<p class="line6">ufficio sovietico distrutto</p>
<p class="line6">tutti i presenti uccisi</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class="pindent">Bond couldn’t understand the rest. He folded the cutting
and handed it back. How much did this man know?
Better treat him as a strongman arm and nothing else.
‘Bad show,’ he said. ‘Gas main I suppose.’ Bond saw
again the obscene belly of the bomb hanging down
from the roof of the alcove in the tunnel, the wires
that started off down the damp wall on their way back
to the plunger in the drawer of Kerim’s desk. Who had
pressed the plunger yesterday afternoon when Tempo
had got through? The ‘Head Clerk’? Or had they drawn
lots and then stood round and watched as the hand
went down and the deep roar had gone up in the Street
of Books on the hill above. They would all have been
there, in the cool room. With eyes that glittered with
hate. The tears would be reserved for the night. Revenge
would have come first. And the rats? How many thousand
had been blasted down the tunnel? What time
would it have been? About four o’clock. Had the daily
meeting been on? Three dead in the room. How many
more in the rest of the building? Friends of Tatiana,
perhaps. He would have to keep the story from her.
Had Darko been watching? From a window in Valhalla?
Bond could hear the great laugh of triumph echoing
round its walls. At any rate Kerim had taken plenty with
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Nash was looking at him. ‘Yes, I daresay it was a gas
main,’ he said without interest.</p>

<p class="pindent">A handbell tinkled down the corridor, coming nearer.
‘<span class="it">Deuxième Service. Deuxième Service. Prenez vos places, s’il vous
plaît.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked across at Tatiana. Her face was pale.
In her eyes there was an appeal to be saved from any
more of this clumsy, non-kulturny man. Bond said,
‘What about lunch?’ She got up at once. ‘What about
you, Nash?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Captain Nash was already on his feet. ‘Had it, thanks
old man. And I’d like to have a look up and down the
train. Is the conductor—you know . . .?’ he made a
gesture of fingering money.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh yes, he’ll co-operate all right,’ said Bond. He reached
up and pulled down the heavy little bag. He opened the
door for Nash. ‘See you later.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Captain Nash stepped into the corridor. He said, ‘Yes,
I expect so, old man.’ He turned left and strode off
down the corridor, moving easily with the swaying of
the train, his hands in his trouser pockets and the light
blazing on the tight golden curls at the back of his
head.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond followed Tatiana up the train. The carriages
were crowded with holiday-makers going home. In the
third-class corridors people sat on their bags chattering
and munching at oranges and at hard-looking rolls with
bits of Salami sticking out of them. The men carefully
examined Tatiana as she squeezed by. The women
looked appraisingly at Bond, wondering whether he
made love to her well.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the restaurant car. Bond ordered Americanos and a
bottle of Chianti Broglio. The wonderful European hors
d’œuvres came. Tatiana began to look more cheerful.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Funny sort of man,’ Bond watched her pick about
among the little dishes. ‘But I’m glad he’s come along.
I’ll have a chance to get some sleep. I’m going to sleep
for a week when we get home.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I do not like him,’ the girl said indifferently. ‘He is
not kulturny. I do not trust his eyes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. ‘Nobody’s kulturny enough for you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Did you know him before?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No. But he belongs to my firm.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What did you say his name is?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nash. Norman Nash.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She spelled it out. ‘N.A.S.H.? Like that?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl’s eyes were puzzled. ‘I suppose you know
what that means in Russian. <span class="it">Nash</span> means “ours”. In our
Services, a man is nash when he is one of “our” men.
He is <span class="it">svoi</span> when he is one of “theirs”—when he belongs
to the enemy. And this man calls himself Nash. That
is not pleasant.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. ‘Really, Tania. You do think of
extraordinary reasons for not liking people. Nash is
quite a common English name. He’s perfectly harmless.
At any rate he’s tough enough for what we want
him for.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana made a face. She went on with her lunch.</p>

<p class="pindent">Some <span class="it">tagliatelli verdi</span> came, and the wine, and then a
delicious escalope. ‘Oh it is so good,’ she said. ‘Since I
came out of Russia I am all stomach.’ Her eyes widened.
‘You won’t let me get too fat, James. You won’t let me
get so fat that I am no use for making love? You will
have to be careful, or I shall just eat all day long and
sleep. You will beat me if I eat too much?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Certainly I will beat you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana wrinkled her nose. He felt the soft caress of
her ankles. The wide eyes looked at him hard. The
lashes came down demurely. ‘Please pay,’ she said. ‘I
feel sleepy.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The train was pulling into Maestre. There was the
beginning of the canals. A cargo gondola full of vegetables
was moving slowly along a straight sheet of water
into the town.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But we shall be coming into Venice in a minute,’
protested Bond. ‘Don’t you want to see it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It will be just another station. And I can see Venice
another day. Now I want you to love me. Please, James.’
Tatiana leaned forward. She put a hand over his. ‘Give
me what I want. There is so little time.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Then it was the little room again and the smell of
the sea coming through the half-open window and
the drawn blind fluttering with the wind of the train.
Again there were the two piles of clothes on the floor,
and the two whispering bodies on the banquette, and the
slow searching hands. And the love-knot formed, and,
as the train jolted over the points into the echoing
station of Venice, there came the final lost despairing
cry.</p>

<p class="pindent">Outside the vacuum of the tiny room there sounded
a confusion of echoing calls and metallic clanging and
shuffling footsteps that slowly faded into sleep.</p>

<p class="pindent">Padua came, and Vicenza, and a fabulous sunset over
Verona flickered gold and red through the cracks of the
blind. Again the little bell came tinkling down the corridor.
They woke. Bond dressed and went into the corridor
and leant against the guard rail. He looked out at the
fading pink light over the Lombardy Plain and thought
of Tatiana and of the future.</p>

<p class="pindent">Nash’s face slid up alongside his in the dark glass.
Nash came very close so that his elbow touched Bond’s.
‘I think I’ve spotted one of the oppo, old man,’ he said
softly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was not surprised. He had assumed that, if it
came, it would come tonight. Almost indifferently he
said, ‘Who is he?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t know what his real name is, but he’s been
through Trieste once or twice. Something to do with
Albania. May be the Resident Director there. Now he’s
on an American passport. “Wilbur Frank.” Calls himself
a banker. In No9, right next to you. I don’t think I
could be wrong about him, old man.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond glanced at the eyes in the big brown face. Again
the furnace door was ajar. The red glare shone out and
was extinguished.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good thing you spotted him. This may be a tough
night. You’d better stick by us from now on. We mustn’t
leave the girl alone.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s what I thought, old man.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They had dinner. It was a silent meal. Nash sat beside
the girl and kept his eyes on his plate. He held his knife
like a fountain pen and frequently wiped it on his fork.
He was clumsy in his movements. Half way through the
meal, he reached for the salt and knocked over Tatiana’s
glass of Chianti. He apologized profusely. He made a
great show of calling for another glass and filling it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Coffee came. Now it was Tatiana who was clumsy.
She knocked over her cup. She had gone very pale and
her breath was coming quickly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Tatiana!’ Bond half rose to his feet. But it was Captain
Nash who jumped up and took charge.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Lady’s come over queer,’ he said shortly. ‘Allow me.’
He reached down and put an arm round the girl and
lifted her to her feet. ‘I’ll take her back to the compartment.
You’d better look after the bag. And there’s the
bill. I can take care of her till you come.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Is all right,’ protested Tatiana with the slack lips of
deepening unconsciousness. ‘Don’ worry, James, I lie
down.’ Her head lolled against Nash’s shoulder. Nash
put one thick arm round her waist and manœuvred her
quickly and efficiently down the crowded aisle and out
of the restaurant car.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond impatiently snapped his fingers for the waiter.
Poor darling. She must be dead beat. Why hadn’t he
thought of the strain she was going through? He cursed
himself for his selfishness. Thank heavens for Nash.
Efficient sort of chap, for all his uncouthness.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond paid the bill. He took up the heavy little bag
and walked as quickly as he could down the crowded
train.</p>

<p class="pindent">He tapped softly on the door of No7. Nash opened
the door. He came out with his finger on his lips. He
closed the door behind him. ‘Threw a bit of a faint,’
he said. ‘She’s all right now. The beds were made up.
She’s gone to sleep in the top one. Been a bit much for
the girl I expect, old man.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond nodded briefly. He went into the compartment.
A hand hung palely down from under the sable coat.
Bond stood on the bottom bunk and gently tucked the
hand under the corner of the coat. The hand felt very
cold. The girl made no sound.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stepped softly down. Better let her sleep. He
went into the corridor.</p>

<p class="pindent">Nash looked at him with empty eyes. ‘Well, I suppose
we’d better settle in for the night. I’ve got my book.’
He held it up. ‘<span class="it">War and Peace.</span> Been trying to plough
through it for years. You take the first sleep, old man.
You look pretty flaked out yourself. I’ll wake you up
when I can’t keep my eyes open any longer.’ He gestured
with his head at the door of No9. ‘Hasn’t shown yet.
Don’t suppose he will if he’s up to any monkey tricks.’
He paused. ‘By the way, you got a gun, old man?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes. Why, haven’t you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Nash looked apologetic. ‘ ’Fraid not. Got a Luger at
home, but it’s too bulky for this sort of job.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, well,’ said Bond reluctantly. You’d better take
mine. Come on in.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They went in and Bond shut the door. He took out
the Beretta and handed it over. ‘Eight shots,’ he said
softly. ‘Semi-automatic. It’s on safe.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Nash took the gun and weighed it professionally in
his hand. He clicked the safe on and off.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond hated someone else touching his gun. He felt
naked without it. He said gruffly, ‘Bit on the light side,
but it’ll kill if you put the bullets in the right places.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Nash nodded. He sat down near the window at the
end of the bottom bunk. ‘I’ll take this end,’ he whispered.
‘Good field of fire.’ He put his book down on
his lap and settled himself.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took off his coat and tie and laid them on the
bunk beside him. He leant back against the pillows and
propped his feet on the bag with the Spektor that stood
on the floor beside his attaché case. He picked up his
Ambler and found his place and tried to read. After a
few pages he found that his concentration was going.
He was too tired. He laid the book down on his lap
and closed his eyes. Could he afford to sleep? Was there
any other precaution they could take?</p>

<p class="pindent">The wedges! Bond felt for them in the pocket of his
coat. He slipped off the bunk and knelt and forced them
hard under the two doors. Then he settled himself again
and switched off the reading light behind his head.</p>

<p class="pindent">The violet eye of the nightlight shone softly down.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thanks, old man,’ said Captain Nash softly.</p>

<p class="pindent">The train gave a moan and crashed into a tunnel.</p>
