<p class="line7"><span class="sc"><span class="gesp">In the</span></span> grey dawn, Zürich airport was depressing and almost
deserted, but, blessedly, there was a Swissair Caravelle,
delayed by fog at London Airport, waiting to take off for
London. Bond parked Tracy in the restaurant and, regretfully
forsaking the smell of coffee and fried eggs, went and
bought himself a ticket, had his passport stamped by a sleepy
official (he had half expected to be stopped, but wasn’t),
and went to a telephone booth and shut himself in. He
looked up Universal Export in the telephone book, and read
underneath, as he had hoped, ‘Hauptvertreter Alexander
Muir. Privat Wohnung’ and the number. Bond glanced
through the glass window at the clock in the departure hall.
Six o’clock. Well, Muir would just have to take it.</p>

<p class="pindent">He rang the number and, after minutes, a sleepy voice said,
‘Ja! Hier Muir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, ‘Sorry, 410, but this is 007. I’m calling from
the airport. This is bloody urgent so I’ll have to take a chance
on your line being bugged. Got a paper and pencil?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The voice at the other end had grown brisker. ‘Hang on,
007. Yes, got it. Go ahead.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘First of all I’ve got some bad news. Your Number Two
has had it. Almost for sure. Can’t give you any details over
this line, but I’m off to London in about an hour—Swissair
Flight 110—and I’ll signal the dope back straight away.
Could you put that on the teleprinter? Right. Now I’m
guessing that in the next day or so a party of ten girls, British,
will be coming in here by helicopter from the Engadine.
Yellow Sud Aviation Alouette. I’ll be teleprinting their
names back from London some time today. My bet is they’ll
be flying to England, probably on different flights and perhaps
to Prestwick and Gatwick as well as London Airport,
if you’ve any planes using those airports. Anyway, I guess
they’ll be dispersed. Now, I think it may be very important
to tell London their flight numbers and ETA. Rather a big
job, but I’ll get you authority in a few hours to use men from
Berne and Geneva to lend a hand. Got it? Right. Now I’m
pretty certain you’re blown. Remember the old Operation
Bedlam that’s just been cancelled? Well, it’s him and he’s
got radio and he’ll probably have guessed I’d be contacting
you this morning. Just take a look out of the window and see
if there’s any sign of watchers. He’s certainly got his men in
Zürich.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Christ, what a shambles!’ The voice at the other end was
tight with tension. ‘Hang on.’ There was a pause. Bond
could visualize Muir, whom he didn’t know except as a
number, going over to the window, carefully drawing aside
the curtain. Muir came back on the wire. ‘Looks damn like it.
There’s a black Porsche across the road. Two men in it. I’ll
get my friends in the Sécurité to chase them away.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, ‘Be careful how you go about it. My guess is
that our man has got a pretty good fix in with the police.
Anyway, put all this on the telex to M personally, would
you? Ciphered of course. And tell him if I get back in one
piece I must see him today, with 501 [the Chief Scientific
Officer to the Service] and if possible with someone in the
same line of business from the Ministry of Agriculture and
Fisheries. Sounds daft, but there it is. It’s going to upset their
paper hats and Christmas pudding, but I can’t help that.
Can you manage all that? Good lad. Any questions?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sure I oughtn’t to come out to the airport and get some
more about my Number Two? He was tailing one of Redland’s
men. Chap’s been buying some pretty odd stuff from
the local rep. of Badische Anilin. Number Two thought it
seemed damned fishy. Didn’t tell me what the stuff was.
Just thought he’d better see where it was being delivered to.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I thought it must be some kind of a spiel like that. No.
You stay away from me. I’m hot as a pistol, going to be
hotter later in the day when they find a certain Mercedes at
the bottom of a precipice. I’ll get off the line now. Sorry to
have wrecked your Christmas. ‘Bye.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond put down the receiver and went up to the restaurant.
Tracy had been watching the door. Her face lit up when she
saw him. He sat down very close to her and took her hand,
a typical airport farewell couple. He ordered plenty of
scrambled eggs and coffee. ‘It’s all right, Tracy. I’ve fixed
everything at my end. But now about you. That car of yours
is going to be bad news. There’ll be people who’ll have
seen you drive away with the Mercedes on your tail. There
always are, even at midnight on Christmas Eve. And the big
man on top of the mountain has got his men down here too.
You’d better finish your breakfast and get the hell on over
the frontier. Which is the nearest?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Schaffhausen or Konstanz, I suppose, but’—she pleaded—‘James,
do I have to leave you now? It’s been so long waiting
for you. And I <span class="it">have</span> done well, haven’t I? Why do you want to
punish me?’ Tears, that would never have been there in the
Royale days, sparkled in her eyes. She wiped them angrily
away with the back of her hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond suddenly thought, Hell! I’ll never find another girl
like this one. She’s got everything I’ve ever looked for in a
woman. She’s beautiful, in bed and out. She’s adventurous,
brave, resourceful. She’s exciting always. She seems to love
me. She’d let me go on with my life. She’s a lone girl, not
cluttered up with friends, relations, belongings. Above all, she
needs me. It’ll be someone for me to look after. I’m fed up
with all these untidy, casual affairs that leave me with a bad
conscience. I wouldn’t mind having children. I’ve got no
social background into which she would or wouldn’t fit.
We’re two of a pair, really. Why not make it for always?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond found his voice saying those words that he had never
said in his life before, never expected to say.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Tracy, I love you. Will you marry me?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She turned very pale. She looked at him wonderingly.
Her lips trembled. ‘You mean that?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, I mean it. With all my heart.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She took her hand away from his and put her face in her
hands. When she removed them she was smiling. ‘I’m sorry,
James. It’s so much what I’ve been dreaming of. It came as a
shock. But yes. Yes, of course I’ll marry you. And I won’t be
silly about it. I won’t make a scene. Just kiss me once and I’ll
be going.’ She looked seriously at him, at every detail of his
face. Then she leaned forward and they kissed.</p>

<p class="pindent">She got up briskly. ‘I suppose I’ve got to get used to
doing what you say. I’ll drive to Munich. To the Vier
Jahreszeiten. It’s my favourite hotel in the world. I’ll wait
for you there. They know me. They’ll take me in without
any luggage. Everything’s at Samaden. I’ll just have to send
out for a toothbrush and stay in bed for two days until I can
go out and get some things. You’ll telephone me? Talk to
me? When can we get married? I must tell Papa. He’ll be
terribly excited.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Let’s get married in Munich. At the Consulate. I’ve got a
kind of diplomatic immunity. I can get the papers through
quickly. Then we can be married again in an English church,
or Scottish rather. That’s where I come from. I’ll call you up
tonight and tomorrow. I’ll get to you just as soon as I can.
I’ve got to finish this business first.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You promise you won’t get hurt?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled. ‘I wouldn’t think of it. For once I’ll run
away if someone starts any shooting.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right then.’ She looked at him carefully again. ‘It’s
time you took off that red handkerchief. I suppose you
realize it’s bitten to ribbons. Give it to me. I’ll mend it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond undid the red bandanna from round his neck. It was
a dark, sweat-soaked rag. And she was right. Two corners of
it were in shreds. He must have got them between his teeth
and chewed on them when the going was bad down the
mountain. He couldn’t remember having done so. He gave it
to her.</p>

<p class="pindent">She took it and, without looking back, walked straight out
of the restaurant and down the stairs towards the exit.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat down. His breakfast came and he began eating
mechanically. What had he done? What in hell had he done?
But the only answer was a feeling of tremendous warmth
and relief and excitement. James and Tracy Bond! Commander
and Mrs Bond! How utterly, utterly extraordinary!</p>

<p class="pindent">The voice of the Tannoy said, ‘Attention, please. Passengers
on Swissair Flight Number 110 for London, please
assemble at gate Number 2. Swissair Flight Number 110 for
London. Passengers to gate Number 2, please.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stubbed out his cigarette, gave a quick glance round
their trysting-place to fix its banality in his mind, and walked
to the door, leaving the fragments of his old life torn up
amidst the debris of an airport breakfast.</p>
