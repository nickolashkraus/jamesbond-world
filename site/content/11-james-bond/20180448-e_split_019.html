<p class="line7"><span class="sc"><span class="gesp">Yes, it</span></span> was Shaun Campbell all right! Christ Almighty,
what a mess! Station Z had especially been told nothing
about Bond’s mission. Campbell must have been following a
lead of his own, probably trailing this Russian who had been
‘buying supplies’. Typical of the sort of balls-up that over-security
can produce!</p>

<p class="pindent">The leading guard was talking in rapid, faulty German
with a Slav accent. ‘He was found in the open ski compartment
at the back of the gondola. Much frozen, but he put up
a strong resistance. He had to be subdued. He was no doubt
following Captain Boris.’ The man caught himself up. ‘I
mean, your guest from the valley, Herr Graf. He says he is
an English tourist from Zürich. That he had got no money
for the fare. He wanted to pay a visit up here. He was
searched. He carried five hundred Swiss francs. No identity
papers.’ The man shrugged. ‘He says his name is Campbell.’</p>

<p class="pindent">At the sound of his name, the man on the ground stirred.
He lifted his head and looked wildly round the room. He
had been badly battered about the face and head with a pistol
or a cosh. His control was shot to pieces. When his eyes lit
on the familiar face of Bond, he looked astonished, then, as
if a lifebuoy had been thrown to him, he said hoarsely,
‘Thank God, James. Tell ’em it’s me! Tell ’em I’m from
Universal Export. In Zürich. You know! For God’s sake,
James! Tell ’em I’m O.K.’ His head fell forward on the
carpet.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Count’s head slowly turned towards Bond. The
opaque green eyes caught the pale light from the window and
glinted whitely. The tight, face-lifted smile was grotesquely
horrible. ‘You know this man, Sir Hilary?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shook his head sorrowfully. He knew he was pronouncing
the death sentence on Campbell. ‘Never seen him
before in my life. Poor chap. He sounds a bit daft to me.
Concussed, probably. Why not ship him down to a hospital
in the valley? He looks in a pretty bad way.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And Universal Export?’ The voice was silky. ‘I seem to
have heard that name before.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, <span class="it">I</span> haven’t,’ said Bond indifferently. ‘Never heard of
it.’ He reached in his pocket for his cigarettes, lit one with a
dead steady hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Count turned back to the guards. He said softly,
‘Zur Befragungszelle.’ He nodded his dismissal. The two
guards bent down and hauled Campbell up by his arm-pits.
The hanging head raised itself, gave one last terrible look of
appeal at Bond. Then the man who was Bond’s colleague was
hustled out of the room and the door was closed softly behind
his dragging feet.</p>

<p class="pindent">To the interrogation cell! That could mean only one
thing, under modern methods, total confession! How long
would Campbell hold out for? How many hours had Bond
got left?</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I have told them to take him to the sick-room. He will be
well looked after.’ The Count looked from the papers on his
desk to Bond. ‘I am afraid this unhappy intrusion has interfered
with my train of thought, Sir Hilary. So perhaps you
will forgive me for this morning?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course, of course. And, regarding your proposition,
that we should work a little more closely together on your
interests, I can assure you, Count, that I find it most interesting.’
Bond smiled conspiratorially. ‘I’m sure we could
come to some satisfactory arrangement.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes? That is good.’ The Count linked his hands behind
his head and gazed for a moment at the ceiling and then,
reflectively, back at Bond. He said casually, ‘I suppose you
would not be connected in any way with the British Secret
Service, Sir Hilary?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed out loud. The laugh was a reflex, forced out
of him by tension. ‘Good God, no! Didn’t even know we had
one. Didn’t all that sort of thing go out with the end of the
war?’ Bond chuckled to himself, fatuously amused. ‘Can’t
quite see myself running about behind a false moustache.
Not my line of country at all. Can’t bear moustaches.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Count’s unwavering smile did not seem to share
Bond’s amusement. He said coldly, ‘Then please forget my
question, Sir Hilary. The intrusion by this man has made me
over-suspicious. I value my privacy up here, Sir Hilary.
Scientific research can only be pursued in an atmosphere of
peace.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I couldn’t agree more.’ Bond was effusive. He got to his
feet and gathered up his papers from the desk. ‘And now I
must get on with my own research work. Just getting into
the fourteenth century. I think I shall have some interesting
data to show you tomorrow, Count.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Count got politely to his feet and Bond went out of
the door and along the passage.</p>

<p class="pindent">He loitered, listening for any sound. There was none, but
half-way down the corridor one of the doors was ajar. A
crack of blood-red light showed. Bond thought, I’ve probably
had it anyway. In for a penny, in for a pound! He pushed
the door open and stuck his head into the room. It was a long,
low laboratory with a plastic-covered work-bench extending
its whole length beneath the windows, which were shuttered.
Dark red light, as in a film-developing chamber, came from
neon strips above the cornice. The bench was littered with
retorts and test-tubes, and there were line upon line of test-tubes
and phials containing a cloudy liquid in racks against
the far wall. Three men in white, with gauze pads over the
bottoms of their faces and white surgical caps over their hair,
were at work, absorbed. Bond took in the scene, a scene from
a theatrical hell, withdrew his head, and walked on down
the corridor and out into what was now a driving snow-storm.
He pulled the top of his sweater over his head and
forced his way along the path to the blessed warmth of the
club-house. Then he walked quickly to his room, closed the
door, and went into the bathroom and sat down on his usual
throne of reflection and wondered what in God’s name to do.</p>

<p class="pindent">Could he have saved Campbell? Well, he could have had a
desperate shot at it. ‘Oh, yes. I know this man. Perfectly
respectable chap. We used to work for the same export firm,
Universal, in London. You look in pretty bad shape, old boy.
What the devil happened?’ But it was just as well he hadn’t
tried. As cover, solid cover, Universal was ‘brûlé’ with the
pros. It had been in use too long. All the secret services in
the world had penetrated it by now. Obviously Blofeld knew
all about it. Any effort to save Campbell would simply have
tied Bond in with him. There had been no alternative except
to throw him to the wolves. If Campbell had a chance to get
his wits back before they really started on him, he would
know that Bond was there for some purpose, that his disavowal
by Bond was desperately important to Bond, to the
Service. How long would he have the strength to cover for
Bond, retrieve his recognition of Bond? At most a few hours.
But how many hours? That was the vital question. That and
how long the storm would last. Bond couldn’t possibly get
away in this stuff. If it stopped, there might be a chance, a
damned slim one, but better than the alternatives, of which,
if and when Campbell talked, there was only one—death,
probably a screaming death.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond surveyed his weapons. They were only his hands and
feet, his Gillette razor and his wrist-watch, a heavy Rolex
Oyster Perpetual on an expanding metal bracelet. Used
properly, these could be turned into most effective knuckledusters.
Bond got up, took the blade out of his Gillette and
dropped the razor into his trouser pocket. He slipped the
shaft between the first and second fingers of his left hand
so that the blade-carrier rested flat along his knuckles. Yes,
that was the way! Now was there anything, any evidence he
should try and take with him? Yes, he must try and get more,
if not all, of the girls’ names and, if possible, addresses. For
some reason he knew they were vital. For that he would
have to use Ruby. His head full of plans for getting the
information out of her, Bond went out of the bathroom and
sat down at his desk and got on with a fresh page of de
Bleuvilles. At least he must continue to show willing, if only
to the recording eye in the ceiling.</p>

<p class="line10">*          *          *</p>

<p class="pindent">It was about twelve-thirty when Bond heard his door-knob
being softly turned. Ruby slipped in and, her finger
to her lips, disappeared into his bathroom. Bond casually
threw down his pen, got up and stretched and strolled over
and went in after her.</p>

<p class="pindent">Ruby’s blue eyes were wide and frightened. ‘You’re in
trouble,’ she whispered urgently. ‘What <span class="it">have</span> you been
doing?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nothing,’ said Bond innocently. ‘What’s up?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We’ve all been told that we mustn’t talk to you unless
Miss Bunt is there.’ Her knuckles went distractedly up to
her teeth. ‘Do you think they know about <span class="it">us</span>?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Couldn’t possibly,’ said Bond, radiating confidence. ‘I
think I know what it is.’ (With so much obfuscation in the
air, what did an extra, a reassuring, lie matter?) ‘This
morning the Count told me I was an upsetting influence here,
that I was what he called “disruptive”, interfering with your
treatments. He asked me to keep myself more to myself.
Honestly’—(how often that word came into a lie!)—‘I’m
sure that’s all it is. Rather a pity really. Apart from you—I
mean you’re sort of special—I think all you girls are terribly
sweet. I’d like to have helped you all.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How do you mean? Helped us?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, this business of surnames. I talked to Violet last
night. She seemed awfully interested. I’m sure it would have
amused all the others to have theirs done. Everyone’s interested
in where they came from. Rather like palmistry in a
way.’ Bond wondered how the College of Arms would have
liked <span class="it">that</span> one! He shrugged. ‘Anyway, I’ve decided to get
the hell away from here. I can’t bear being shepherded and
ordered about like this. Who the hell do they think I am?
But I’ll tell you what I’ll do. If you can give me the names
of the girls, as many as you know, I’ll do a piece on each of
them and post them when you all get back to England. How
much longer have you got, by the way?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We’re not told exactly, but the rumour is about another
week. There’s another batch of girls due about then. When
we’re slow at our work or get behind-hand with our reading,
Miss Bunt says she hopes the next lot won’t be so stupid.
The old bitch! But Sir Hilary’—the blue eyes filled with
concern—‘how <span class="it">are</span> you going to get away? You know we’re
practically prisoners up here.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was off-hand. ‘Oh, I’ll manage somehow. They
can’t hold <span class="it">me</span> here against my will. But what about the names,
Ruby? Don’t you think it would give the girls a treat?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, they’d love it. Of course I know all of them. We’ve
found plenty of ways of exchanging secrets. But you won’t
be able to remember. Have you got anything to write
down on?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond tore off some strips of lavatory paper and took out a
pencil. ‘Fire away!’</p>

<p class="pindent">She laughed. ‘Well, you know me and Violet, then there’s
Elizabeth Mackinnon. She’s from Aberdeen. Beryl Morgan
from somewhere in Herefordshire. Pearl Tampion, Devonshire—by
the way, all those simply loathed every kind of
cattle. Now they live on steaks! Would you believe it? I must
say the Count’s a wonderful man.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, indeed.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Then there’s Anne Charter from Canterbury and Caresse
Ventnor from the National Stud, wherever that is—fancy
her working there and she came up in a rash all over whenever
she went near a horse! Now all she does is dream of pony
clubs and read every word she can get hold of about Pat
Smythe! And Denise Robertson . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">The list went on until Bond had got the whole ten. He
said, ‘What about that Polly somebody who left in November?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Polly Tasker. She was from East Anglia. Don’t remember
where, but I can find out the address when I get back to
England. Sir Hilary’—she put her arm round his neck—‘I <span class="it">am</span>
going to see you again, aren’t I?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond held her tight and kissed her. ‘Of course, Ruby.
You can always get me at the College of Arms in Queen
Victoria Street. Just send me a postcard when you get back.
But for God’s sake cut out the “Sir”. You’re my girl friend.
Remember?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, yes, I will—er—Hilary,’ she said fervently. ‘And
you will be careful, getting away I mean. You’re sure it’s all
right? Is there anything I can do to help?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No, darling. Just don’t breathe a word of all this. It’s
a secret between us. Right?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course, darling.’ She glanced at her watch. ‘Oh lord!
I must simply fly. Only ten minutes to lunch-time. Now, can
you do your trick with the door? There shouldn’t be anyone
about. It’s their lunch-time from twelve till one.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond, out of any possible line of vision from the eye in
the ceiling, did his trick with the door and she was gone with
a last whispered goodbye.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond eased the door shut. He let out a deep sigh and went
over to the window and peered out through the snow-heaped
panes. It was thick as Hades outside and the fine powder
snow on the veranda was whirling up in little ghosts as the
wind tore at the building. Pray God it would let up by nighttime!
Now, what did he need in the way of equipment?
Goggles and gloves were two items he might harvest over
lunch. Bond went into the bathroom again and rubbed soap
into his eyes. It stung like hell, but the blue-grey eyes
emerged from the treatment realistically bloodshot. Satisfied,
Bond rang for the ‘warden’ and went thoughtfully off to the
restaurant.</p>

<p class="pindent">Silence fell as he went through the swing doors, followed
by a polite, brittle chatter. Eyes followed him discreetly as
he crossed the room and the replies to his good-mornings
were muted. Bond took his usual seat between Ruby and
Fräulein Bunt. Apparently oblivious to her frosty greeting,
he snapped his fingers for a waiter and ordered his double
vodka dry Martini. He turned to Fräulein Bunt and smiled
into the suspicious yellow eyes. ‘Would you be very kind?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, Sair Hilary. What is it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gestured at his still watering eyes. ‘I’ve got the
Count’s trouble. Sort of conjunctivitis, I suppose. The
tremendous glare up here. Better today of course, but there’s
still a lot of reflection from the snow. And all this paperwork.
Could you get me a pair of snow-goggles? I’ll only
need to borrow them for a day or two. Just till my eyes get
used to the light. Don’t usually have this sort of trouble.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes. That can be done. I will see that they are put in
your room.’ She summoned the head waiter and gave him
the order in German. The man, looking at Bond with overt
dislike, said, ‘Sofort, gnädiges Fräulein,’ and clicked his
heels.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And one more thing, if you will,’ said Bond politely. ‘A
small flask of schnapps.’ He turned to Fräulein Bunt. ‘I find
I am not sleeping well up here. Perhaps a nightcap would
help. I always have one at home—generally whisky. But
here I would prefer schnapps. When in Gloria, do as the
Glorians do. Ha ha!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Fräulein Bunt looked at him stonily. She said to the waiter
curtly, ‘In Ordnung!’ The man took Bond’s order of Pâté
Maison followed by Œufs Gloria and the cheese tray (Bond
thought he had better get some stuffing into him!), clicked
his heels and went away. Was he one of those who had been
at work in the interrogation room? Bond silently ground his
teeth. By God, if it came to hitting any of these guards
tonight, he was going to hit them damned hard, with everything
he’d got! He felt Fräulein Bunt’s eyes inquisitively on
him. He untensed himself and began to make amiable conversation
about the storm. How long would it last? What was
the barometer doing?</p>

<p class="pindent">Violet, guardedly but helpfully, said the guides thought
it would clear up during the afternoon. The barometer was
rising. She looked nervously at Fräulein Bunt to see if she
had said too much to the pariah, and then, not reassured,
went back to her two vast baked potatoes with poached eggs
in them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s drink came. He swallowed it in two gulps and
ordered another. He felt like making any gesture that would
startle and outrage. He said, combatively, to Fräulein Bunt,
‘And how is that poor chap who came up in the cable car
this morning? He looked in terrible shape. I do hope he’s up
and about again.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He makes progress.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh! Who was that?’ asked Ruby eagerly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It was an intruder.’ Fräulein Bunt’s eyes were hard with
warning. ‘It is not a subject for conversation.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, but why not?’ asked Bond innocently. ‘After all, you
can’t get much excitement up here. Anything out of the
ordinary should be a bit of a relief.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She said nothing. Bond raised his eyebrows politely and
then accepted the snub with a good grace. He asked if any
newspapers came up. Or was there a radio bulletin like on
board ship? Did they get any news from the outside world?</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gave up the struggle and got on with his lunch.
Ruby’s foot crept up against his in sympathy with the man
sent to Coventry. Bond gave it a gentle kick of warning
and withdrew his. The girls at the other tables began to
leave. Bond toyed with his cheese and coffee until Fräulein
Bunt got to her feet and said, ‘Come, girls.’ Bond rose and
sat down again. Now, except for the waiters clearing up,
he was alone in the restaurant. That was what he wanted.
He got up and strolled to the door. Outside, on pegs against
the wall, the girls’ outdoor coats and skiing gloves hung in
an orderly row. The corridor was empty. Bond swept the
largest pair of leather gauntlets he could see off the peg
where they hung by their joining cord and stuffed them
inside his sweater. Then he sauntered along to the reception
room. It was empty. The door to the ski-room was open
and the surly man was at his work-bench. Bond went in
and made one-sided conversation about the weather. Then,
under cover of desultory talk about whether the metal skis
were not more dangerous than the old wooden ones, he
wandered, his hands innocently in his pockets, round the
numbered racks in which the skis stood against the wall.
They were mostly the girls’ skis. No good! The bindings
would be too small for his boots. But, by the door, in unnumbered
slots, stood the guides’ skis. Bond’s eyes narrowed
to slits as he scanned them, measuring, estimating. Yes, the
pair of metal Heads with the red V’s painted on the black
curved tips was the best bet. They were of the stiffer,
Master’s, category, designed for racing. Bond remembered
reading somewhere that the Standard model was inclined to
‘float’ at speed. His choice had the Attenhofer Flex forward
release with the Marker lateral release. Two transverse
leather thongs wound round the ankle and buckled over the
instep would, if he fell, which he was certain to do, ensure
against losing a ski.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond made a quick guess at how much the bindings would
need adjustment to fit his boots and went off down the
corridor to his room.</p>
