<p class="line7"><span class="sc"><span class="gesp">Almost exactly</span></span> twenty-four hours before, James Bond
had been nursing his car, the old Continental Bentley—the
‘R’ type chassis with the big 6 engine and a 13:40 back-axle
ratio—that he had now been driving for three years,
along that fast but dull stretch of N.1 between Abbeville and
Montreuil that takes the English tourist back to his country
via Silver City Airways from Le Touquet or by ferry from
Boulogne or Calais. He was hurrying safely, at between
eighty and ninety, driving by the automatic pilot that is built
in to all rally-class drivers, and his mind was totally occupied
with drafting his letter of resignation from the Secret
Service.</p>

<p class="pindent">The letter, addressed ‘Personal for M’, had got to the
following stage:</p>

<div class="blockquote-right90percent">

<p class="line7">Sir,</p>

<p class="pindent">I have the honour to request that you will accept my
resignation from the Service, effective forthwith.</p>

<p class="pindent">My reasons for this submission, which I put forward
with much regret, are the following:</p>

<p class="pindent">(1) My duties in the Service, until some twelve months
ago, have been connected with the Double-O Section and
you, Sir, have been kind enough, from time to time, to
express your satisfaction with my performance of those
duties, which I, for my part, have enjoyed. To my chagrin,
[Bond had been pleased with this fine word] however, on
the successful completion of Operation ‘Thunderball’, I
received personal instructions from you to concentrate all
my efforts, without a terminal date, [another felicitous
phrase!] on the pursuit of Ernst Stavro Blofeld and on his
apprehension, together with any members of <span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">SPECTRE</span></span>—otherwise
‘The Special Executive for Counter-intelligence, Terrorism,
Revenge and Extortion’—if that organization had
been re-created since its destruction at the climax of
Operation ‘Thunderball’.</p>

<p class="pindent">(2) I accepted the assignment with, if you will recall, reluctance.
It seemed to me, and I so expressed myself at
the time, that this was purely an investigatory matter
which could well have been handled, using straightforward
police methods, by other sections of the Service—local
Stations, allied foreign secret services and Interpol.
My objections were overruled, and for close on twelve
months I have been engaged all over the world in routine
detective work which, in the case of every scrap of
rumour, every lead, has proved abortive. I have found
no trace of this man nor of a revived <span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">SPECTRE</span></span>, if such
exists.</p>

<p class="pindent">(3) My many appeals to be relieved of this wearisome and
fruitless assignment, even when addressed to you personally,
Sir, have been ignored or, on occasion, curtly
dismissed, and my frequent animadversions [another good
one!] to the effect that Blofeld is dead have been treated
with a courtesy that I can only describe as scant. [Neat,
that! Perhaps a bit too neat!]</p>

<p class="pindent">(4) The above unhappy circumstances have recently
achieved their climax in my undercover mission (Ref.
Station R′S PX 437/007) to Palermo, in pursuit of a hare
of quite outrageous falsity. This animal took the shape of
one ‘Blauenfelder’, a perfectly respectable German citizen
engaged in viniculture—specifically the grafting of Moselle
grapes on to the Sicilian strains to enhance the sugar
content of the latter which, for your passing information,
[Steady on, old chap! Better redraft all this!] are inclined
to sourness. My investigations into this individual brought
me to the attention of the Mafia and my departure from
Sicily was, to say the least, ignominious.</p>

<p class="pindent">(5) Having regard, Sir, to the above and, specifically, to
the continued misuse of the qualities, modest though they
may be, that have previously fitted me for the more arduous,
and, to me, more rewarding, duties associated with the
work of the Double-O Section, I beg leave to submit my
resignation from the Service.</p>

<p class="line3">I am, Sir,</p>

<p class="line8">Your Obedient Servant,</p>

<p class="line9">007</p>

</div>

<p class="pindent">Of course, reflected Bond, as he nursed the long bonnet
of his car through a built-up S-bend, he would have to rewrite
a lot of it. Some of it was a bit pompous and there were
one or two cracks that would have to be ironed out or toned
down. But that was the gist of what he would dictate to his
secretary when he got back to the office the day after tomorrow.
And if she burst into tears, to hell with her! He
meant it. By God he did. He was fed to the teeth with chasing
the ghost of Blofeld. And the same went for <span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">SPECTRE</span></span>. The
thing had been smashed. Even a man of Blofeld’s genius, in
the impossible event that he still existed, could never get a
machine of that calibre running again.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was then, on a ten-mile straight cut through a forest,
that it happened. Triple wind-horns screamed their banshee
discord in his ear, and a low, white two-seater, a Lancia
Flaminia Zagato Spyder with its hood down, tore past him,
cut in cheekily across his bonnet and pulled away, the sexy
boom of its twin exhausts echoing back from the border of
trees. And it was a girl driving, a girl with a shocking pink
scarf tied round her hair, leaving a brief pink tail that the
wind blew horizontal behind her.</p>

<p class="pindent">If there was one thing that set James Bond really moving
in life, with the exception of gun-play, it was being passed at
speed by a pretty girl; and it was his experience that girls who
drove competitively like that were always pretty—and exciting.
The shock of the wind-horn’s scream had automatically
cut out ‘George’, emptied Bond’s head of all other thought,
and brought his car back under manual control. Now, with a
tight-lipped smile, he stamped his foot into the floorboard,
held the wheel firmly at a quarter to three, and went after her.</p>

<p class="pindent">100, 110, 115, and he still wasn’t gaining. Bond reached
forward to the dashboard and flicked up a red switch. The
thin high whine of machinery on the brink of torment tore
at his eardrums and the Bentley gave an almost perceptible
kick forward. 120, 125. He was definitely gaining. 50 yards,
40, 30! Now he could just see her eyes in her rear mirror.
But the good road was running out. One of those exclamation
marks that the French use to denote danger flashed by on his
right. And now, over a rise, there was a church spire, the
clustered houses of a small village at the bottom of a steepish
hill, the snake sign of another S-bend. Both cars slowed
down—90, 80, 70. Bond watched her tail-lights briefly blaze,
saw her right hand reach down to the floor stick, almost
simultaneously with his own, and change down. Then they
were in the S-bend, on cobbles, and he had to brake as he
enviously watched the way her de Dion axle married her rear
wheels to the rough going, while his own live axle hopped and
skittered as he wrenched at the wheel. And then it was the
end of the village, and, with a brief wag of her tail as she came
out of the S, she was off like a bat out of hell up the long
straight rise and he had lost fifty yards.</p>

<p class="pindent">And so the race went on, Bond gaining a little on the
straights but losing it all to the famous Lancia road-holding
through the villages—and, he had to admit, to her wonderful,
nerveless driving. And now a big Michelin sign said ‘Montreuil
5, Royale-les-Eaux 10, Le Touquet-Paris-Plage 15’,
and he wondered about her destination and debated with
himself whether he shouldn’t forget about Royale and the
night he had promised himself at its famous casino and just
follow where she went, wherever it was, and find out who
this devil of a girl was.</p>

<p class="pindent">The decision was taken out of his hands. Montreuil is a
dangerous town with cobbled, twisting streets and much
farm traffic. Bond was fifty yards behind her at the outskirts,
but, with his big car, he couldn’t follow her fast
slalom through the hazards and, by the time he was out of
the town and over the Étaples-Paris level-crossing, she had
vanished. The left-hand turn for Royale came up. Was
there a little dust hanging in the bend? Bond took the turn,
somehow knowing that he was going to see her again.</p>

<p class="pindent">He leaned forward and flicked down the red switch. The
moan of the blower died away and there was silence in the
car as he motored along, easing his tense muscles. He wondered
if the supercharger had damaged the engine. Against
the solemn warnings of Rolls-Royce, he had had fitted, by
his pet expert at the Headquarters’ motor pool, an Arnott
supercharger controlled by a magnetic clutch. Rolls-Royce
had said the crankshaft bearings wouldn’t take the extra
load and, when he confessed to them what he had done, they
regretfully but firmly withdrew their guarantees and washed
their hands of their bastardized child. This was the first
time he had notched 125 and the rev. counter had hovered
dangerously over the red area at 4500. But the temperature
and oil were OK and there were no expensive noises. And,
by God, it had been fun!</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond idled through the pretty approaches to Royale,
through the young beeches and the heavy-scented pines,
looking forward to the evening and remembering his other
annual pilgrimages to this place and, particularly, the great
battle across the baize he had had with Le Chiffre so many
years ago. He had come a long way since then, dodged many
bullets and much death and loved many girls, but there had
been a drama and a poignancy about that particular adventure
that every year drew him back to Royale and its casino and
to the small granite cross in the little churchyard that simply
said ‘Vesper Lynd. RIP.’</p>

<p class="pindent">And now what was the place holding for him on this
beautiful September evening? A big win? A painful loss? A
beautiful girl—that beautiful girl?</p>

<p class="pindent">To think first of the game. This was the week-end of the
‘clôture annuelle’. Tonight, this very Saturday night, the
Casino Royale was holding its last night of the season. It was
always a big event and there would be pilgrims even from
Belgium and Holland, as well as the rich regulars from Paris
and Lille. In addition, the ‘Syndicat d’Initiative et des Bains
de Mer de Royale’ traditionally threw open its doors to all its
local contractors and suppliers, and there was free champagne
and a great groaning buffet to reward the town people for
their work during the season. It was a tremendous carouse
that rarely finished before breakfast time. The tables would
be packed and there would be a very high game indeed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had one million francs of private capital—Old
Francs, of course—about seven hundred pounds’ worth. He
always reckoned his private funds in Old Francs. It made him
feel so rich. On the other hand, he made out his official
expenses in New Francs because that made them look smaller—but
probably not to the Chief Accountant at Headquarters!
One million francs! For that evening he was a millionaire!
Might he so remain by tomorrow morning!</p>

<p class="pindent">And now he was coming into the Promenade des Anglais
and there was the bastard Empire frontage of the Hotel
Splendide. And there, by God, on the gravel sweep alongside
its steps, stood the little white Lancia and, at this
moment a bagagiste, in a striped waistcoat and green
apron, was carrying two Vuitton suitcases up the steps to
the entrance!</p>

<p class="pindent">So!</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond slid his car into the million-pound line of cars
in the car park, told the same bagagiste, who was now taking
rich, small stuff out of the Lancia, to bring up his bags, and
went in to the reception-desk. The manager impressively
took over from the clerk and greeted Bond with golden-toothed
effusion, while making a mental note to earn a good
mark with the Chef de Police by reporting Bond’s arrival, so
that the Chef could, in his turn, make a good mark with the
Deuxième and the SDT by putting the news on the teleprinter
to Paris.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, ‘By the way, Monsieur Maurice. Who is the
lady who has just driven up in the white Lancia? She is
staying here?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, indeed, Mon Commandant.’ Bond received an extra
two teeth in the enthusiastic smile. ‘The lady is a good friend
of the house. The father is a very big industrial from the
South. She is La Comtesse Teresa di Vicenzo. Monsieur
must surely have read of her in the papers. Madame la
Comtesse is a lady—how shall I put it?’—the smile became
secret, between men—‘a lady, shall we say, who lives life to
the full.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ah, yes. Thank you. And how has the season been?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The small talk continued as the manager personally took
Bond up in the lift and showed him into one of the handsome
grey and white Directoire rooms with the deep rose coverlet
on the bed that Bond remembered so well. Then, with a
final exchange of courtesies, James Bond was alone.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was faintly disappointed. She sounded a bit grand
for him, and he didn’t happen to like girls, film stars for
instance, who were in any way public property. He liked
private girls, girls he could discover himself and make his
own. Perhaps, he admitted, there was inverted snobbery in
this. Perhaps, even less worthily, it was that the famous ones
were less easy to get.</p>

<p class="pindent">His two battered suitcases came and he unpacked leisurely
and then ordered from Room Service a bottle of the Taittinger
Blanc de Blancs that he had made his traditional drink at
Royale. When the bottle, in its frosted silver bucket, came,
he drank a quarter of it rather fast and then went into the
bathroom and had an ice-cold shower and washed his hair
with Pinaud Elixir, that prince among shampoos, to get the
dust of the roads out of it. Then he slipped on his dark-blue
tropical worsted trousers, white Sea Island cotton shirt,
socks and black casual shoes (he abhorred shoe-laces), and
went and sat by the window and looked out across the promenade
to the sea and wondered where he would have
dinner and what he would choose to eat.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond was not a gourmet. In England he lived on
grilled soles, œufs cocotte and cold roast beef with potato
salad. But when travelling abroad, generally by himself,
meals were a welcome break in the day, something to look
forward to, something to break the tension of fast driving,
with its risks taken or avoided, the narrow squeaks, the permanent
background of concern for the fitness of his machine.
In fact, at this moment, after covering the long stretch from
the Italian frontier at Ventimiglia in a comfortable three days
(God knew there was no reason to hurry back to Headquarters!),
he was fed to the teeth with the sucker-traps for
gourmandizing tourists. The ‘Hostelleries’, the ‘Vieilles
Auberges’, the ‘Relais Fleuris’—he had had the lot. He had
had their ‘Bonnes Tables’, and their ‘Fines Bouteilles’. He
had had their ‘Spécialités du Chef’—generally a rich sauce
of cream and wine and a few button mushrooms concealing
poor quality meat or fish. He had had the whole lip-smacking
ritual of winemanship and foodmanship and, incidentally,
he had had quite enough of the Bisodol that went with it!</p>

<p class="pindent">The French belly-religion had delivered its final kick at
him the night before. Wishing to avoid Orléans, he had
stopped south of this uninspiring city and had chosen a mock-Breton
Auberge on the south bank of the Loire, despite its
profusion of window-boxes and sham beams, ignoring the
china cat pursuing the china bird across its gabled roof,
because it was right on the edge of the Loire—perhaps Bond’s
favourite river in the world. He had stoically accepted the
hammered copper warming pans, brass cooking utensils and
other antique bogosities that cluttered the walls of the
entrance hall, had left his bag in his room and had gone for
an agreeable walk along the softly running, swallow-skimmed
river. The dining-room, in which he was one of a small
handful of tourists, had sounded the alarm. Above a fire-place
of electric logs and over-polished fire-irons there had
hung a coloured plaster escutcheon bearing the dread device:
<span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">ICY DOULCE FRANCE</span></span>. All the plates, of some hideous local
ware, bore the jingle, irritatingly inscrutable, ‘Jamais en
Vain, Toujours en Vin’, and the surly waiter, stale with ‘fin
de saison’, had served him with the fly-walk of the Pâté
Maison (sent back for a new slice) and a Poularde à la crème
that was the only genuine antique in the place. Bond had
moodily washed down this sleazy provender with a bottle of
instant Pouilly-Fuissé and was finally insulted the next
morning by a bill for the meal in excess of five pounds.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was to efface all these dyspeptic memories that Bond
now sat at his window, sipped his Taittinger and weighed
up the pros and cons of the local eating places and wondered
what dishes it would be best to gamble on. He finally chose
one of his favourite restaurants in France, a modest establishment,
unpromisingly placed exactly opposite the railway
station of Étaples, rang up his old friend Monsieur Bécaud
for a table and, two hours later, was motoring back to the
Casino with Turbot poché, sauce mousseline, and half the
best roast partridge he had eaten in his life, under his belt.</p>

<p class="pindent">Greatly encouraged, and further stimulated by half a
bottle of Mouton Rothschild ’53 and a glass of ten-year-old
Calvados with his three cups of coffee, he went cheerfully
up the thronged steps of the Casino with the absolute certitude
that this was going to be a night to remember.</p>
