<p class="line7"><span class="sc"><span class="gesp">Franklin began</span></span> reading in an even, expository tone of
voice, frequently stopping to explain a point or when he
skipped irrelevant passages.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘This section,’ he said, ‘is headed “Biological Warfare
Weapons and Defense”. This is how it goes on:</p>

<p class="pindent">‘ “Biological Warfare”,’ he read, ‘ “is often referred to as
bacteriological, bacterial, or germ warfare but it is preferred
over those terms because it includes all micro-organisms, insects
and other pests, and toxic products of plant and animal life.
The Army lists five groups of BW agents, including certain
chemical compounds used to inhibit or destroy plant growth:</p>

<div class="blockquote-right90percent">

<p class="hang">Micro-organisms (bacteria, viruses, rickettsiae, fungi,
protozoa).</p>

<p class="hang">Toxins (microbial, animal, plant).</p>

<p class="hang">Vectors of disease (arthropods (insects and acarids),
birds and animals).</p>

<p class="hang">Pests (of animals and crops).</p>

<p class="hang">Chemical anti-crop compounds (plant-growth inhibitors,
herbicides, defoliants).</p>

</div>

<p class="pindent">‘ “Biological Warfare agents, like Chemical Warfare
agents, vary in lethality, making it possible to select an agent
best suited to accomplish the objective desired, whether it be
temporary incapacity with little after-effects or serious illness
and many deaths. There are some important differences
between BW and CW other than their scientific classifications.
BW agents have an incubation period of days, sometimes
weeks” ’—(Franklin looked up. ‘See what I mean about
Olympia?’)—‘ “which produces a lag in their action while CW
weapons usually bring reactions within a few seconds to a few
hours. CW agents are easier to detect than BW agents, and
identification of the latter could often be too late to permit
effective counter-measures.” ’ (Franklin again looked significantly
at his audience) ‘ “. . . BW agents theoretically are
more dangerous, weight for weight, than CW agents, though
this advantage may be cancelled because of loss of virulence
by BW agents under exposure.” ’</p>

<p class="pindent">Franklin paused. His finger went down the page. ‘Then
it goes on to talk about anti-personnel BW agents like anthrax,
typhus, smallpox, botulism, and so on. Yes’—his finger
stopped—‘here we are. “Anti-animal BW agents which
might be used to incapacitate or destroy domestic animals are:</p>

<div class="blockquote-right90percent">

<p class="hang">Bacteria: Anthrax, three closely related species of
brucella, and glanders.</p>

<p class="hang">Viruses: Foot-and-mouth disease, rinderpest, Rift
Valley fever, vesicular stomatitis, vesicular exanthema,
hog cholera, African swine fever, fowl plague, Newcastle
disease, and equine encephalomyelitis.” ’</p>

</div>

<p class="line7">Franklin looked up apologetically. ‘Sorry about all this jaw-breaking
stuff, but there’s not much more of it. Then it
goes on to “Anti-crop BW agents”, which they say would be
used as economic weapons, as I personally think is the case
with the Blofeld scheme, and they mention a whole list
including potato blight, cereal stem disease, crown rust of
oats, curly top disease of sugar beets, block rot of crucifers
and potato ring rot, and insects such as the Colorado beetle
and something called “the Giant African Land-snail”,
which I somehow don’t think we need worry about. Then
they talk about “chemical anti-crop agents”, but I don’t
think we need worry about those either as they’d have to be
sprayed from an aeroplane, though, for what it’s worth,
they’re damned lethal. Now, this is more to the point.’
Franklin’s finger halted on the page. ‘ “The nature of BW
agents makes them very adaptable for covert or undercover
operations. The fact that these agents are so concentrated,
cannot be detected by physical senses, and have a delayed
casualty effect, would enable an operator quietly to introduce
effective amounts into building ventilation systems, food
and water supplies, and other places where they would be
spread rapidly through contact with a heavily concentrated
population.” ’ Franklin paused. ‘And that means us. You see
what I mean about livestock shows and so on? After the show,
the virus gets carried off all over the country by the exhibits.’
He went back to his pamphlet. ‘And here it goes on, “A
significant factor is that the possible area of effective coverage
is generally greater with BW than with CW agents. Tests
have been made which show that coverage measured in the
thousands of square miles is quite feasible with biological
agents,” ’ Franklin tapped the paper in front of him. ‘How
about that, gentlemen? We talk about the new poison gases,
the nerve gases the Germans invented in the war. We march
and counter-march about radiation and the atom bomb.
“Thousands of square miles” it says here. A Committee of
the United States Senate says it. How many thousands of
square miles are there in the United Kingdom and Eire,
gentlemen?’ The eyes, urgent and holding humour no longer,
looked almost scornfully into the faces of these three top
officers of the Secret Service. ‘I’ll tell you. There are only
something over one hundred thousand square miles of this
little atoll of ours, including the little atoll of all Ireland.’
His eyes retained their fire. ‘And let me just give you a last
quote and then perhaps’—the eyes regained some of their
humour—‘you’ll realize why I’m getting so steamed up on
this Day of Goodwill to all Men. Look here, what it says
under “Defensive Measures”. It says, “Defense against BW
warfare is greatly complicated by the difficulties involved in
detection of BW agents, a situation which is almost unique
as to these weapons.” ’ (Franklin looked up and now he
smiled. ‘Bad English. Perhaps we might improve on “as to”.)
“They cannot be detected by sight, smell, or any other
physical sense. So far no means have been devised for their
quick detection and identification.” ’</p>

<p class="pindent">Franklin threw the pamphlet on to the desk. Suddenly he
gave a big, embracing smile. He reached for his little polished
pipe and began filling it. ‘All right, gentlemen. The prosecution
rests.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Franklin had had his day, a Christmas he would never forget.</p>

<p class="pindent">M said, ‘Thank you, Mr Franklin. Am I right in thinking
that you conclude that this man Blofeld is mounting Biological
Warfare against this country?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes.’ Franklin was definite. ‘I am.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And how do you work that out? It seems to me he’s doing
exactly the opposite—or rather it would if I didn’t know something
about the man. Anyway, what are your deductions?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Franklin reached over and pointed to the red cross he had
made over East Anglia. ‘That was my first clue. The girl,
Polly Tasker, who left this Gloria place over a month ago,
came from somewhere round here where you’ll see from the
symbols that there’s the greatest concentration of turkey
farmers. She suffered from an allergy against turkeys. She
came back inspired to improve the breed. Within a week of
her return, we have the biggest outbreak of fowl pest affecting
turkeys in the history of England.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leathers suddenly slapped his thigh. ‘By God, I think
you’ve got it, Franklin! Go on!’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now’—Franklin turned to Bond—‘when this officer
took a look into the laboratory up there he saw rack upon
rack of test-tubes containing what he describes as “a cloudy
liquid”. How would it be if those were viruses, Fowl Pest,
anthrax, God knows what all? The report mentions that the
laboratory was lit with a dim red light. That would be
correct. Virus cultures suffer from exposure to bright light.
And how would it be if before this Polly girl left she was
given an aerosol spray of the right stuff and told that this
was some kind of turkey elixir—a tonic to make them grow
fatter and healthier? Remember that stuff about “improving
the breed” in the hypnosis talk? And suppose she was told
to go to Olympia for the Show, perhaps even take a job for
the meeting as a cleaner or something, and just casually spray
this aerosol here and there among the prize birds. It wouldn’t
be bigger than one of those shaving-soap bombs. That’d be
quite enough. She’d been told to keep it secret, that it was
patent stuff. Perhaps even that she’d be given shares in the
company if the tonic proved the success this man Blofeld
claimed it would. It’d be quite easy to do. She’d just wander
round the cages—perhaps she was even given a special purse
to carry the thing in—lean up against the wire and psst!
the job would be done. Easy as falling off a log. All right, if
you’ll go along with me so far, she was probably told to do
the job on one of the last two days of the show, so that the
effects wouldn’t be seen too soon. Then, at the end of the
show, all the prize birds are dispersed back to their owners
all over England. And that’s that! And’—he paused—‘mark
you, that <span class="it">was</span> that. Three million birds dead and still
dying all over the place, and a great chunk of foreign currency
coughed up by the Treasury to replace them.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leathers, his face red with excitement, butted in. He
swept his hand over the map. ‘And the other girls! All from
the danger spots. All from the areas of greatest concentration.
Local shows taking place all the time—cattle, poultry, even
potatoes—Colorado beetle for that crop, I suppose. Swine
Fever for the pigs. Golly!’ There was reverence in Leathers’s
voice. ‘And it’s so damned simple! All you’d need would
be to keep the viruses at the right temperature for a while.
They’d be instructed in that, the little darlings. And all the
time they’d be sure they were being saints! Marvellous. I
really must hand it to the man.’</p>

<p class="pindent">M’s face was thunderous with the fury of his indecision.
He turned to Bond. He barked, ‘What do you think?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m afraid it fits, sir. The whole way along the line. We
know the man. It fits him too. Right up his street. And it
doesn’t even matter who’s paying him. He can pay himself,
make a fortune. All he has to do is go a bear of sterling or
Gilt-Edged. If Mr Franklin’s right, and that Senate paper’s
pretty solid backing for him, our currency’ll literally go
through the floor—and the country with it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">M got to his feet. He said, ‘All right, gentlemen. Mr
Franklin, will you tell your Minister what you’ve heard?
It’ll be up to him to tell the PM and the Cabinet as he
thinks fit. I’ll get on with the preventive measures, first
of all through Sir Ronald Vallance of the CID. We must
pick up this Polly woman and get the others as they come
into the country. They’ll be gently treated. It’s not their fault.
Then we’ll have to think what to do with Mister Blofeld.’
He turned to Bond. ‘Stay behind, would you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Goodbyes were said and M rang for Hammond to see the
other two out. He then rang again, ‘Tea, please, Hammond.’
He turned to Bond. ‘Or rather have a whisky and soda?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Whisky, please, sir,’ said Bond with infinite relief.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Rot-gut,’ commented M. He walked over to the window
and looked out at the darkness and rain.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond drew Franklin’s map towards him and studied it.
He reflected that he was learning quite a lot on this case—about
other people’s businesses, other people’s secrets, from
the innards of the College of Arms to the innards of Ag. and
Fish. Odd how this gigantic, many-branched tree had grown
from one tiny seed in September—a girl calling banco in a
casino and not having the money to pay. And what about
Bond’s letter of resignation? That looked pretty silly now.
He was up to his ears, as deeply as ever in his life before,
in his old profession. And now a big mopping-up job would
have to be done. And he would have to do it, or at any rate
lead it, organize it. And Bond knew exactly what he was
going to put to M when the tea and whisky came. Only <span class="it">he</span>
could do the cleaning up. It was written in his stars!</p>

<p class="pindent">Hammond came in with the tray and withdrew. M came
back to his desk, gruffly told Bond to pour himself a whisky,
and himself took a vast cup, as big as a baby’s chamber-pot,
of black tea without sugar or milk, and put it in front of him.</p>

<p class="pindent">At length he said moodily, ‘This is a dirty business,
James. But I’m afraid it makes sense. Better do something
about it, I suppose.’ He reached for the red telephone with
scrambler attachment that stood beside the black one on his
desk and picked up the receiver. It was a direct line to that
very private switchboard in Whitehall to which perhaps fifty
people in all Britain have access. ‘Put me on to Sir Ronald
Vallance, would you? Home number, I suppose,’ He reached
out and took a deep gulp at his cup of tea and put the cup
back on its saucer. Then, ‘That you, Vallance? M here.
Sorry to disturb your afternoon nap.’ There was an audible
explosion at the other end of the line! M smiled. ‘Reading a
report on teen-age prostitution? I’m ashamed of you. On
Christmas Day too. Well, scramble, would you?’ M pressed
down the large black button on the side of the cradle. ‘Right?
Now I’m afraid this is top priority. Remember Blofeld and
the Thunderball case? Well, he’s up to his tricks again.
Too long to explain now. You’ll get my side of the report in
the morning. And Ag. and Fish. are mixed up in it. Yes, of all
people. Man called Franklin is your contact. One of their
top pest-control men. Only him and his Minister. So would
your chaps report to him, copy to me? I’m only dealing
with the foreign side. Your friend 007’s got the ball. Yes,
same chap. He can fill you in with any extra detail you may
need on the foreign angles. Now, the point is this. Even
though it’s Christmas and all that, could your chaps try at
once and lay their hands on a certain girl, Polly Tasker, aged
about 25, who lives in East Anglia? Yes, I know it’s a hell of a
big area, but she’ll probably come from a respectable lower-middle-class
family connected with turkey farming. Certainly
find the family in the telephone book. Can’t give you any
description, but she’s just been spending several weeks in
Switzerland. Got back the last week in November. Don’t
be ridiculous! Of course you can manage it. And when you
find her, take her into custody for importing Fowl Pest into
the country. Yes, that’s right.’ M spelt it out. ‘The stuff
that’s been killing all our turkeys.’ M muttered ‘Thank
God!’ away from the receiver. ‘No, I didn’t say anything.
Now, be kind to the girl. She didn’t know what she was
doing. And tell the parents it’ll be all right. If you need a
formal charge, you’ll have to get one out of Franklin. Then
tell Franklin when you’ve got her and he’ll come down and
ask her one or two simple questions. When he’s got the
answers, you can let her go. Right? But we’ve <span class="it">got</span> to find that
girl. You’ll see why all right when you’ve read the report.
Now then, next assignment. There are ten girls of much the
same type as this Polly Tasker who’ll probably be flying from
Zürich to England and Eire any day from tomorrow on.
Each one has got to be held by the Customs at the port or
airport of entry. 007 has a list of their names and fairly good
descriptions. My people in Zürich may or may not be able
to give us warning of their arrival. Is that all right? Yes,
007 will bring the list to Scotland Yard this evening. No,
I can’t tell you what it’s all about. Too long a story. But
have you ever heard of Biological Warfare? That’s right.
Anthrax and so on. Well, this is it. Yes. Blofeld again. I know.
That’s what I’m just going to talk to 007 about. Well now,
Vallance, have you got all that? Fine.’ M listened. He smiled
grimly. ‘And a Happy Christmas to <span class="it">you</span>.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He put the receiver back and the scrambler button automatically
clicked to OFF. He looked across at Bond. He
said, with a hint of weariness, ‘Well, that’s taken care of this
end. Vallance said it was about time we had this fellow
Blofeld in the bag. I agree. And that’s <span class="it">our</span> job. And I don’t
for a moment think we’re going to get any help from the
Swiss. Even if we were to, they’d trample all over the case
with their big boots for weeks before we saw any action. By
that time the man would be in Peking or somewhere, cooking
up something else,’ M looked straight at Bond. ‘Any ideas?’</p>

<p class="pindent">It had come, as Bond knew it would. He took a deep pull
at his whisky and put the glass carefully down. He began
talking, urgently, persuasively. As he expounded his plan,
M’s face sank deeper and deeper in gloom, and, when Bond
concluded with ‘And that’s the only way I can see, sir. All I
need is two weeks’ leave of absence. I could put in a letter of
resignation if it would help,’ M turned in his chair and gazed
deep into the dying flames of the log fire.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat quietly, waiting for the verdict. He hoped it
would be yes, but he also hoped it would be no. That
damned mountain! He never wanted to see the bloody thing
again!</p>

<p class="pindent">M turned back. The grey eyes were fierce. ‘All right, 007.
Go ahead. I can’t go to the PM about it. He’d refuse. But for
God’s sake bring it off. I don’t mind being sacked, but we
don’t want to get the Government mixed up in another U2
fiasco. Right?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I understand, sir. And I can have the two weeks’ leave?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes.’</p>
