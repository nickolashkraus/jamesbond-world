<p class="line7"><span class="sc"><span class="gesp">It was</span></span> eleven o’clock and the place was as quiet as the
grave. Bond, with due respect for the eye in the ceiling,
went through the motions of going to the bathroom and
then climbing into bed and switching off his light. He gave
it ten minutes, then got quietly out of bed and pulled on his
trousers and shirt. Working by touch, he slipped the end of
the inch of plastic into the door crack, found the lock and
pressed gently. The edge of the plastic caught the curve of
the lock and slid it back. Bond now only had to push gently
and the door was open. He listened, his ears pricked like an
animal’s. Then he carefully put his head out. The empty
corridor yawned at him. Bond slipped out of the door, closed
it softly, took the few steps along to Number Three and
gently turned the handle. It was dark inside but there was a
stirring in the bed. Now to avoid the click of the shutting
door! Bond took his bit of plastic and got it against the lock,
holding it in the mortice. Then he inched the door shut,
at the same time gently withdrawing the plastic. The lock
slid noiselessly into place.</p>

<p class="pindent">There came a whisper from the bed. ‘Is that you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, darling.’ Bond slid out of his clothes and, assuming
the same geography as in his own room, walked gingerly
over to the bed and sat down on its edge.</p>

<p class="pindent">A hand came out of the darkness and touched him. ‘Ooh,
you’ve got nothing on!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond caught the hand and reached along it. ‘Nor have
you,’ he whispered. ‘That’s how it should be.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Gingerly he lay down on the bed and put his head beside
hers on the pillow. He noticed with a pang of pleasure that
she had left room for him. He kissed her, at first softly and
then with fierceness. Her body stirred. Her mouth yielded
to his and when his left hand began its exploration she put
her arms round him. ‘I’m catching cold.’ Bond followed the
lie by pulling the single sheet away from under him and then
covering them both with it. The warmth and softness of her
splendid body were now all his. Bond lay against her. He
drew the fingernails of his left hand softly down her flat
stomach. The velvety skin fluttered. She gave a small groan
and reached down for his hand and held it. ‘You do love me
a little bit?’</p>

<p class="pindent">That awful question! Bond whispered, ‘I think you’re the
most adorable, beautiful girl. I wish I’d met you before.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The stale, insincere words seemed to be enough. She
removed her restraining hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">Her hair smelt of new-mown summer grass, her mouth of
Pepsodent, and her body of Mennen’s Baby Powder. A small
night wind rose up outside and moaned round the building,
giving an extra sweetness, an extra warmth, even a certain
friendship to what was no more than an act of physical
passion. There was real pleasure in what they did to each
other, and in the end, when it was over and they lay quietly
in each other’s arms, Bond knew, and knew that the girl
knew, that they had done nothing wrong, done no harm to
each other.</p>

<p class="pindent">After a while Bond whispered into her hair, ‘Ruby!’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mmmm.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘About your name. About the Windsors. I’m afraid there’s
not much hope.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, well, I never really believed. You know these old
family stories.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Anyway, I haven’t got enough books here. When I get
back I’ll dig into it properly. Promise. It’ll be a question of
starting with your family and going back—church and town
records and so forth. I’ll have it done properly and send it to
you. Great slab of parchment with a lot of snazzy print.
Heavy black italics with coloured letters to start each line.
Although it mayn’t get you anywhere, it might be nice to
have.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You mean like old documents in museums?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s right.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’d be nice.’</p>

<p class="pindent">There was silence in the little room. Her breathing became
regular. Bond thought: how extraordinary! Here on top of
this mountain, a death’s run away from the nearest hamlet
in the valley, in this little room were peace, silence, warmth,
happiness—many of the ingredients of love. It was like
making love in a balloon. Which nineteenth-century rake had
it been who had recorded a bet in a London club that he
would make love to a woman in a balloon?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was on the edge of sleep. He let himself slide down
the soft, easy slope. Here it was wonderful. It would be just
as easy for him to get back to his room in the early hours.
He softly eased his right arm from under the sleeping girl,
took a lazy glance at his left wrist. The big luminous numerals
said midnight.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had hardly turned over on his right side, up against
the soft flanks of the sleeping girl, when, from underneath
the pillow, under the floor, deep in the bowels of the building,
there came the peremptory ringing of a deep-toned, melodious
electric bell. The girl stirred. She said sleepily, ‘Oh,
damn!’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What is it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, it’s only the treatment. I suppose it’s midnight?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t pay any attention. It’s only for me. Just go to
sleep.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond kissed her between the shoulder-blades but said
nothing.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now the bell had stopped. In its place there started up a
droning whine, rather like the noise of a very fast electric
fan, with, behind it, the steady, unvarying tick-pause-tock,
tick-pause-tock of some kind of metronome. The combination
of the two sounds was wonderfully soothing. It compelled
attention, but only just on the fringe of consciousness—like
the night-noises of childhood, the slow tick of the
nursery clock combined with the sound of the sea or the
wind outside. And now a voice, the Count’s voice came over
the distant wire or tape that Bond assumed was the mechanical
source of all this. The voice was pitched in a low, singsong
murmur, caressing yet authoritative, and every word
was distinct. ‘You are going to sleep.’ The voice fell on the
word ‘sleep’. ‘You are tired and your limbs feel like lead.’
Again the falling cadence on the last word. ‘Your arms feel
as heavy, as lead. Your breathing is quite even. Your breathing
is as regular as a child’s. Your eyes are closed and the eyelids
are heavy as lead. You are becoming tireder and tireder.
Your whole body is becoming tired and heavy as lead. You
are warm and comfortable. You are slipping, slipping, slipping
down into sleep. Your bed is as soft and downy as a
nest. You are as soft and sleepy as a chicken in a nest. A dear
little chicken, fluffy and cuddly.’ There came the sound of a
sweet cooing and clucking, the gentle brushing together of
wings, the dozy murmuring of mother hens with their chicks.
It went on for perhaps a full minute. Then the voice came
back. ‘The little darlings are going to sleep. They are like
you, comfortable and sleepy in their nests. You love them
dearly, dearly, dearly. You love all chickens. You would
like to make pets of them all. You would like them to grow up
beautiful and strong. You would like no harm to come to
them. Soon you will be going back to your darling chickens.
Soon you will be able to look after them again. Soon you
will be able to help all the chickens of England. You will be
able to improve the breed of chickens all over England.
This will make you very, very happy. You will be doing so
much good that it will make you very, very happy. But you
will keep quiet about it. You will say nothing of your methods.
They will be your own secret, your very own secret. People
will try and find out your secret. But you will say nothing
because they might try and take your secret away from you.
And then you would not be able to make your darling
chickens happy and healthy and strong. Thousands, millions
of chickens made happier because of you. So you will say
nothing and keep your secret. You will say nothing, nothing
at all. You will remember what I say. You will remember
what I say.’ The murmuring voice was getting farther and
farther away. The sweet cooing and clucking of chickens
softly obscured the vanishing voice, then that too died away
and there was only the electric whine and the tick-pause-tock
of the metronome.</p>

<p class="pindent">Ruby was deeply asleep. Bond reached out for her wrist
and felt the pulse. It was plumb on beat with the metronome.
And now that, and the whine of the machine, receded
softly until all was dead silence again save for the soft moan
of the night wind outside.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond let out a deep sigh. So now he had heard it all! He
suddenly wanted to get back to his room and think. He
slipped out from under the sheet, got to his clothes, and put
them on. He manipulated the lock without trouble. There
was no movement, no sound, in the passage. He slipped
back into Number Two and eased the door shut. Then he
went into his bathroom, closed the door, switched on the light,
and sat down on the lavatory and put his head in his hands.</p>

<p class="pindent">Deep hypnosis! That was what he had heard. The Hidden
Persuader! The repetitive, singsong message injected into the
brain while it was on the twilight edge of consciousness. Now,
in Ruby’s subconscious, the message would work on all by
itself through the night, leaving her, after weeks of repetition,
with an in-built mechanism of obedience to the voice that
would be as deep, as compelling, as hunger.</p>

<p class="pindent">But what in hell was the message all about? Surely it was a
most harmless, even a praiseworthy message to instil in the
simple mind of this country girl. She had been cured of her
allergy and she would return home fully capable of helping
with the family poultry business—more than that, enthusiastic,
dedicated. Had the leopard changed his spots?
Had the old lag become, in the corny, hackneyed tradition, a
do-gooder? Bond simply couldn’t believe it. What about all
those high-powered security arrangements? What about the
multi-racial staff that positively stank of <span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">SPECTRE</span></span>? And what
about the bob-run murder? Accident? So soon after the
man’s attempted rape of this Sarah girl? An impossible
coincidence! Malignity must somewhere lie behind the
benign, clinical front of this maddeningly innocent research
outfit! But where? How in hell could he find out?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond, exhausted, got up and turned off the light in the
bathroom and quietly got himself into bed. The mind
whirred on for a sterile half-hour in the over-heated brain
and then, mercifully, he went to sleep.</p>

<p class="line10">*          *          *</p>

<p class="pindent">When, at nine o’clock, he awoke and threw open his
windows, the sky was overcast with the heavy blank grey
that meant snow. Over by the Berghaus, the Schneefinken,
and Schneevögel, the snow-finches and Alpine choughs, that
lived on the crumbs and left-overs of the picnickers, were
fluttering and swooping close round the building—a sure
storm-warning. The wind had got up and was blowing in
sharp, threatening gusts, and no whine of machinery came
from the cable railway. The light aluminium gondolas would
have too bad a time in winds of this strength, particularly
over the last great swoop of cable that brought them a good
quarter of a mile over the exposed shoulder beneath the
plateau.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shut the windows and rang for his breakfast. When
it came there was a note from Fräulein Bunt on the tray.
‘The Count will be pleased to receive you at eleven o’clock.
<span class="calibre2">I.B.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond ate his breakfast and got down to his third page of
de Bleuvilles. He had quite a chunk of work to show up,
but this was easy stuff. The prospect of successfully bamboozling
his way along the Blofeld part of the trail was not so
encouraging. He would start boldly at the Gdynia end and
work back—get the old rascal to talk about his youth and his
parents. Old rascal? Well, dammit, whatever he had become
since Operation ‘Thunderball’, there weren’t two Ernst
Stavro Blofelds in the world!</p>

<p class="pindent">They met in the Count’s study. ‘Good morning, Sir
Hilary. I hope you slept well? We are going to have snow.’
The Count waved towards the window. ‘It will be a good
day for work. No distractions.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled a man-to-man smile. ‘I certainly find those
girls pretty distracting. But most charming. What’s the
matter with them, by the way? They all look healthy enough.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Count was off-hand. ‘They suffer from allergies, Sir
Hilary. Crippling allergies. In the agricultural field. They
are country girls and their disabilities affect the possibility
of their employment. I have devised a cure for such symptoms.
I am glad to say that the signs are propitious. We are
making much progress together.’ The telephone by his side
buzzed. ‘Excuse me.’ The Count picked up the receiver and
listened. ‘Ja. Machen Sie die Verbindung.’ He paused.
Bond politely studied the papers he had brought along.
‘Zdies de Bleuville . . . Da . . . Da . . . Kharascho!’ He put
the receiver back. ‘Forgive me. That was one of my research
workers. He has been purchasing some materials for the
laboratories. The cable railway is closed, but they are making
a special trip up for him. Brave man. He will probably be
very sick, poor fellow.’ The green contact lenses hid any
sympathy he may have felt. The fixed smile showed none.
‘And now, my dear Sir Hilary, let us get on with our work.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laid out his big sheets on the desk and proudly ran
his finger down through the generations. There was excitement
and satisfaction in the Count’s comments and questions.
‘But this is tremendous, really tremendous, my dear
fellow. And you say there is mention of a broken spear or a
broken sword in the arms? Now when was that granted?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond rattled off a lot of stuff about the Norman Conquest.
The broken sword had probably been awarded as a result of
some battle. More research in London would be needed to
pin the occasion down. Finally Bond rolled up the sheets and
got out his notebook. ‘And now we must start working back
from the other end, Count.’ Bond became inquisitorial,
authoritative. ‘We have your birth date in Gdynia, May 28th,
1908. Yes?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Correct.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Your parents’ names?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ernst George Blofeld and Maria Stavro Michelopoulos.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Also born in Gdynia?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now your grandparents?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ernst Stefan Blofeld and Elizabeth Lubomirskaya.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hm, so the Ernst is something of a family Christian
name?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It would seem so. My great-grandfather, he was also
Ernst.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That is most important. You see, Count, among the
Blofelds of Augsburg there are no less than two Ernsts!’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Count’s hands had been lying on the green blotting-pad
on his desk, relaxed. Now, impulsively, they joined
together and briefly writhed, showing white knuckles.</p>

<p class="pindent">My God, you’ve got it bad! thought Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And that is important?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Very. Christian names run through families. We regard
them as most significant clues. Now, can you remember any
farther back? You have done well. We have covered three
generations. With the dates I shall later ask you for, we have
already got back to around 1850. Only another fifty years to
go and we shall have arrived at Augsburg.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No.’ It was almost a cry of pain. ‘My great-great-grandfather.
Of him I know nothing.’ The hands writhed on the
blotting-paper. ‘Perhaps, perhaps. If it is a question of
money. People, witnesses could be found.’ The hands parted,
held themselves out expansively. ‘My dear Sir Hilary, you
and I are men of the world. We understand each other.
Extracts from archives, registry offices, the churches—these
things, do they have to be completely authentic?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Got you, you old fox! Bond said affably, with a hint of
conspiracy, ‘I don’t quite understand what you mean, Count.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The hands were now flat on the desk again, happy hands.
Blofeld had recognized one of his kind. ‘You are a hardworking
man, Sir Hilary. You live modestly in this remote
region of Scotland. Life could perhaps be made easier for
you. There are perhaps material benefits you desire—motorcars,
a yacht, a pension. You have only to say the word, name
a figure.’ The dark-green orbs bored into Bond’s modestly
evasive eyes, holding them. ‘Just a little co-operation. A
visit here and there in Poland and Germany and France. Of
course your expenses would be heavy. Let us say five
hundred pounds a week. The technical matters, the documents,
and so forth. Those I can arrange. It would only
require your supporting evidence. Yes? The Ministry of
Justice in Paris, for them the word of the College of Arms
is the word of God. Is that not so?’</p>

<p class="pindent">It was too good to be true! But how to play it? Diffidently,
Bond said, ‘What you are suggesting, Count, is—er—not
without interest. Of course’—Bond’s smile was sufficiently
expansive, sufficiently bland—‘if the documents were convincing,
so to speak solid, very solid, then it would be quite
reasonable for me to authenticate them.’ Bond put spaniel
into his eyes, asking to be patted, to be told that everything
would be all right, that he would be completely protected.
‘You see what I mean?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Count began, with force, sincerity, ‘You need have
absolutely no . . .’ when there was the noise of an approaching
hubbub down the passage. The door burst open. A man,
propelled from behind, lurched into the room and fell,
writhing, to the floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">Two of the guards came stiffly to attention behind him.
They looked first at the Count and then, sideways, towards
Bond, surprised to see him there.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Count said sharply, ‘Was ist denn los?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond knew the answer and, momentarily, he died. Behind
the snow and the blood on the face of the man on the floor,
Bond recognized the face of a man he knew.</p>

<p class="pindent">The blond hair, the nose broken boxing for the Navy,
belonged to a friend of his in the Service. It was, unmistakably,
Number 2 from Station Z in Zürich!</p>
