<div class="blockquote-right90percent">

<p class="line7"><span class="sc"><span class="gesp">My dear</span></span> Sable Basilisk,</p>

<p class="pindent">I arrived safely—by helicopter, if you please!—at
this beautiful place called Piz Gloria, 10,000 feet up somewhere
in the Engadine. Most comfortable with an excellent
male staff of several nationalities and a most efficient secretary
to the Count named Fräulein Irma Bunt who tells me that
she comes from Munich.</p>

<p class="pindent">I had a most profitable interview with the Count this
morning as a result of which he wishes me to stay on for a
week to complete the first draft of his genealogical tree. I do
hope you can spare me for so long. I warned the Count that
we had much work to do on the new Commonwealth States.
He himself, though busily engaged on what sounds like very
public-spirited research work on allergies and their cause
(he has ten English girls here as his patients), has agreed to
see me daily in the hope that together we may be able to
bridge the gap between the migration of the de Bleuvilles
from France and their subsequent transference, as Blofelds,
from Augsburg to Gdynia. I have suggested to him that we
conclude the work with a quick visit to Augsburg for the
purposes you and I discussed, but he has not yet given me
his decision.</p>

<p class="pindent">Please tell my cousin Jenny Bray that she may be hearing
from a friend of her late husband who apparently served
with him in the Lovat Scouts. He came up to me at lunch
today and took me for the other Hilary! Quite a coincidence!</p>

<p class="pindent">Working conditions are excellent. We have complete
privacy here, secure from the madding world of skiers, and
very sensibly the girls are confined to their rooms after ten
at night to put them out of the temptation of roaming and
gossiping. They seem a very nice lot, from all over the United
Kingdom, but rather on the dumb side!</p>

<p class="pindent">Now for my most interesting item. The Count has <span class="it">not</span>
got lobes to his ears! Isn’t that good news! He also is of a
most distinguished appearance and bearing with a fine head
of silvery hair and a charming smile. His slim figure also
indicates noble extraction. Unfortunately he has to wear
dark-green contact lenses because of weak eyes and the
strength of the sunshine at this height, and his aquiline nose
is blemished by a deformed nostril which I would have
thought could easily have been put right by facial surgery.
He speaks impeccable English with a gay lilt to his voice
and I am sure that we will get on very well.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now to get down to business. It would be most helpful if
you would get in touch with the old printers of the Almanach
de Gotha and see if they can help us over our gaps in the
lineage. They may have some traces. Cable anything helpful.
With the new evidence of the ear-lobes I am quite confident
that the connexion exists.</p>

<p class="pindent">That’s all for now.</p>

<p class="line11">Yours ever,</p>
<p class="line12"><span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">HILARY BRAY</span></span></p>

<div class="blockquote-right95percent">

<p class="line7">P.S. Don’t tell my mother, or she will be worried for my
safety among the eternal snows! But we had a nasty
accident here this morning. One of the staff, a Yugoslav
it seems, slipped on the bob-run and went the whole way
to the bottom! Terrible business. He’s apparently being
buried in Pontresina tomorrow. Do you think we ought to
send some kind of a wreath? <span class="calibre2">H.B.</span></p>

</div>

</div>

<p class="pindent">Bond read the letter several times. Yes, that would give
the officers in charge of Operation ‘Corona’ plenty to bite on.
Particularly the hint that they should get the dead man’s
name from the registrar in Pontresina. And he had covered
up a bit on the Bray mix-up when the letter, as Bond was sure
it would be, was steamed open and photostated before
dispatch. They might of course just destroy it. To prevent
this, the bit of bogosity about the Almanach de Gotha would
be a clincher. This source of heraldic knowledge hadn’t been
mentioned before. It would surely excite the interest of
Blofeld.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond rang the bell, handed out the letter for dispatch,
and got back to his work, which consisted initially of going
into the bathroom with the strip of plastic and his scissors
in his pocket and snipping two inch-wide strips off the end.
These would be enough for the purposes he and, he hoped,
Ruby would put them to. Then, using the first joint of his
thumb as a rough guide, he marked off the remaining
eighteen inches into inch measures, to support his lie about
the ruler, and went back to his desk and to the next hundred
years of the de Bleuvilles.</p>

<p class="pindent">At about five o’clock the light got so bad that Bond got up
from his table and stretched, preparatory to going over to the
light-switch near the door. He took a last look out of the
window before he closed it. The veranda was completely
deserted and the foam rubber cushions for the reclining-chairs
had already been taken in. From the direction of the
cable-head there still came the whine of machinery that had
been part of the background noises to the day. Yesterday the
railway had closed at about five, and it must be time for the
last pair of gondolas to complete their two-way journey and
settle in their respective stations for the night. Bond closed
the double windows, walked across to the thermostat and put
it down to seventy. He was just about to reach for the light-switch
when there came a very soft tapping at the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond kept his voice low. ‘Come in!’</p>

<p class="pindent">The door opened and quickly closed to within an inch of
the lock. It was Ruby. She put her fingers to her lips and
gestured towards the bathroom. Bond, highly intrigued,
followed her in and shut the door. Then he turned on the
light. She was blushing. She whispered imploringly, ‘Oh,
please forgive me, Sir Hilary. But I did so want to talk to
you for a second.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s fine, Ruby. But why the bathroom?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, didn’t you know? No, I suppose you wouldn’t. It’s
supposed to be a secret, but of course I can tell you. You
won’t let on, will you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No, of course not.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, all the rooms have microphones in them. I don’t
know where. But sometimes we girls have got together in
each other’s rooms, just for a gossip, you know, and Miss
Bunt has always known. We think they’ve got some sort of
television too.’ She giggled. ‘We always undress in the bathroom.
It’s just a sort of feeling. As if one was being watched
the whole time. I suppose it’s something to do with the
treatment.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, I expect so.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The point is, Sir Hilary, I was tremendously excited by
what you were saying at lunch today, about Miss Bunt
perhaps being a duchess. I mean, is that really possible?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh yes,’ said Bond airily.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I was so disappointed at not being able to tell you my
surname. You see, you see’—her eyes were wide with excitement—‘it’s
Windsor!’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Gosh,’ said Bond, ‘that’s interesting!’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I knew you’d say that. You see, there’s always been talk
in my family that we’re distantly connected with the Royal
Family!’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I can quite understand that.’ Bond’s voice was thoughtful,
judicious. ‘I’d like to be able to do some work on that. What
were your parents’ names? I must have them first.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘George Albert Windsor and Mary Potts. Does that mean
anything?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, of course, the Albert’s significant.’ Bond felt a cur.
‘You see, there was the Prince Consort to Queen Victoria.
He was Albert.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh golly!’ Ruby’s knuckles went up to her mouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But of course all this needs a lot of working on. Where do
you come from in England? Where were you born?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘In Lancashire. Morecambe Bay, where the shrimps come
from. But a lot of poultry too. You know.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So that’s why you love chicken so much.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, no.’ She seemed surprised by the remark. ‘That’s
just the point. You see, I was allergic to chickens. I simply
couldn’t bear them—all those feathers, the stupid pecking,
the mess and the smell. I loathed them. Even eating chicken
brought me out in a sort of rash. It was awful, and of course
my parents were mad at me, they being poultry farmers in
quite a big way and me being supposed to help clean out the
batteries—you know, those modern mass-produced chicken
places. And then one day I saw this advertisement in the
paper, in the <span class="it">Poultry Farmer’s Gazette</span>. It said that anyone
suffering from chicken allergy—then followed a long Latin
name—could apply for a course of re . . . of re . . . for a cure
in a Swiss institute doing research work on the thing. All
found and ten pounds a week pocket-money. Rather like
those people who go and act as rabbits in that place that’s
trying to find a cure for colds.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I know,’ said Bond encouragingly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So I applied and my fare was paid down to London and I
met Miss Bunt and she put me through some sort of exam.’
She giggled. ‘Heaven only knows how I passed it, as I failed
my G.C.E. twice. But she said I was just what the Institute
wanted and I came out here about two months ago. It’s not
bad. They’re terribly strict. But the Count has absolutely
cured my trouble. I simply love chickens now.’ Her eyes
became suddenly rapt. ‘I think they’re just the most beautiful,
wonderful birds in the world.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, that’s a jolly good show,’ said Bond, totally mystified.
‘Now about your name. I’ll get to work on it right away.
But how are we going to talk? You all seem to be pretty
carefully organized. How can I see you by yourself? The
only place is my room or yours.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You mean <span class="it">at night</span>?’ The big blue eyes were wide with
fright, excitement, maidenly appraisal.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, it’s the only way.’ Bond took a bold step towards
her and kissed her full on the mouth. He put his arms round
her clumsily. ‘And you know I think you’re terribly attractive.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, Sir Hilary!’</p>

<p class="pindent">But she didn’t recoil. She just stood there like a great
lovely doll, passive, slightly calculating, wanting to be a
princess. ‘But how would you get out of here? They’re
terribly strict. A guard goes up and down the passage every
so often. Of course’—the eyes were calculating—‘it’s true
that I’m next door to you, in Number Three actually. If
only we had some way of getting out.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took one of the inch strips of plastic out of his
pocket and showed it to her. ‘I knew you were somewhere
close to me. Instinct, I suppose. [Cad!] I learned a thing or
two in the Army. You can get out of these sort of doors by
slipping this in the door crack in front of the lock and
pushing. It slips the latch. Here, take this, I’ve got another.
But hide it away. And promise not to tell anyone.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ooh! You are a one! But of course I promise. But do
you think there’s any hope—about the Windsors, I mean?’
Now she put her arms round his neck, round the witchdoctor’s
neck, and the big blue orbs gazed appealingly
into his.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You definitely mustn’t rely on it,’ said Bond firmly,
trying to get back an ounce of his self-respect. ‘But I’ll have
a quick look now in my books. Not much time before
drinks. Anyway, we’ll see.’ He gave her another long and,
he admitted to himself, extremely splendid kiss, to which she
responded with an animalism that slightly salved his conscience.
‘Now then, baby.’ His right hand ran down her back
to the curve of her behind, to which he gave an encouraging
and hastening pat. ‘We’ve got to get you out of here.’</p>

<p class="pindent">His bedroom was dark. They listened at the door like two
children playing hide-and-seek. The building was in silence.
He inched open the door. He gave the behind an extra pat
and she was gone.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond paused for a moment. Then he switched on the
light. The innocent room smiled at him. Bond went to his
table and reached for the <span class="it">Dictionary of British Surnames</span>.
Windsor, Windsor, Windsor. Here we are! Now then! As he
bent over the small print, an important reflection seared his
spy’s mind like a shooting star. All right. So sexual perversions,
and sex itself, were a main security risk. So was
greed for money. But what about status? What about that
most insidious of vices, snobbery?</p>

<p class="pindent">Six o’clock came. Bond had a nagging headache, brought
on by hours of poring over small-print reference books and
aggravated by the lack of oxygen at the high altitude. He
needed a drink, three drinks. He had a quick shower and
smartened himself up, rang his bell for the ‘warder’ and
went along to the bar. Only a few of the girls were already
there. Violet sat alone at the bar and Bond joined her. She
seemed pleased to see him. She was drinking a Daiquiri.
Bond ordered another and, for himself, a double Bourbon
on the rocks. He took a deep pull at it and put the squat glass
down. ‘By God, I needed that! I’ve been working like a
slave all day while you’ve been waltzing about the ski-slopes
in the sun!’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Have I indeed!’ A slight Irish brogue came out with the
indignation. ‘Two lectures this morning, frightfully boring,
and I had to catch up with my reading most of this afternoon.
I’m way behind with it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What sort of reading?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, sort of agricultural stuff.’ The dark eyes watched
him carefully. ‘We’re not supposed to talk about our cures,
you know.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, well,’ said Bond cheerfully, ‘then let’s talk about
something else. Where do you come from?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ireland. The South. Near Shannon.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had a shot in the dark. ‘All that potato country.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, that’s right. I used to hate them. Nothing but
potatoes to eat and potato crops to talk about. Now I’m
longing to get back. Funny, isn’t it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Your family’ll be pleased.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You can say that again! And my boy friend! He’s on the
wholesale side. I said I wouldn’t marry anyone who had
anything to do with the damned, dirty, ugly things. He’s
going to get a shock all right . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How’s that?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All I’ve learned about how to improve the crop. The latest
scientific ways, chemicals, and so on.’ She put her hand up
to her mouth. She glanced swiftly round the room, at the
bartender. To see if anyone had heard this innocent stuff?
She put on a hostess smile. ‘Now you tell me what you’ve
been working on, Sir Hilary.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, just some heraldic stuff for the Count. Like I was
talking about at lunch. I’m afraid you’d find it frightfully
dry stuff.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh no, I wouldn’t. I was terribly interested in what you
were saying to Miss Bunt. You see’—she lowered her voice
and spoke into her raised glass—‘I’m an O’Neill. They used
to be almost kings of Ireland. Do you think . . .’ She had
seen something over his shoulder. She went on smoothly,
‘And I simply can’t get my shoulders round enough. And
when I try to I simply over-balance.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘ ’Fraid I don’t know anything about skiing,’ said Bond
loudly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Irma Bunt appeared in the mirror over the bar. ‘Ah, Sair
Hilary.’ She inspected his face. ‘But yes, you are already
getting a little of the sunburn, isn’t it? Come! Let us go and
sit down. I see poor Miss Ruby over there all by herself.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They followed her meekly. Bond was amused by the little
undercurrent of rule-breaking that went on among the girls—the
typical resistance pattern to strict discipline and the
governessy ways of this hideous matron. He must be careful
how he handled it, useful though it was proving. It wouldn’t
do to get these girls too much ‘on his side’. But, if only
because the Count didn’t want him to know them, he must
somehow ferret away at their surnames and addresses.
Ferret! That was the word! Ruby would be his ferret. Bond
sat down beside her, the back of his hand casually brushing
against her shoulder.</p>

<p class="pindent">More drinks were ordered. The Bourbon was beginning
to uncoil Bond’s tensions. His headache, instead of occupying
his whole head, had localized itself behind the right temple.
He said, gaily, ‘Shall we play the game again?’</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a chorus of approval. The glass and paper
napkins were brought from the bar and now more of the
girls joined in. Bond handed round cigarettes and the girls
puffed vigorously, occasionally choking over the smoke.
Even Irma Bunt seemed infected by the laughter and squeals
of excitement as the cobweb of paper became more and more
tenuous. ‘Careful! Gently, Elizabeth! Ayee! But now you
have done it! And there was still this little corner that was
safe!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was next to her. Now he sat back and suggested
that the girls should have a game among themselves. He
turned to Fräulein Bunt. ‘By the way, if I can find the time,
it crossed my mind that it might be fun to go down in the
cable car and pay a visit to the valley. I gathered from talk
among the crowds today that St Moritz is the other side of
the valley. I’ve never been there. I’d love to see it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Alas, my dear Sair Hilary, but that is against the rules of
the house. Guests here, and the staff too, have no access to
the Seilbahn. That is only for the tourists. Here we keep
ourselves to ourselves. We are—how shall I say?—a little
dedicated community. We observe the rules almost of a
monastery. It is better so, isn’t it? Thus we can pursue our
researches in peace.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, I quite see that.’ Bond’s smile was understanding,
friendly. ‘But I hardly count myself as a patient here, really.
Couldn’t an exception be made in my case?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I think that would be a mistake, Sair Hilary. And surely
you will need all the time you have to complete your duties
for the Count. No’—it was an order—‘I am afraid, with
many apologies, that what you ask is out of the question.’
She glanced at her watch and clapped her hands. ‘And now,
girls,’ she called, ‘it is time for the supper. Come along!
Come along!’</p>

<p class="pindent">It had only been a try-on, to see what form the negative
answer would take. But, as Bond followed her into the dining-room,
it was quite an effort to restrain his right shoe from
giving Irma Bunt a really tremendous kick in her tight,
bulging behind.</p>
