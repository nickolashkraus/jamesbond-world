<p class="line7"><span class="sc"><span class="gesp">It was</span></span> two months later, in London, and James Bond was
driving lazily up from his Chelsea flat to his headquarters.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was nine-thirty in the morning of yet another beautiful
day of this beautiful year, but, in Hyde Park, the fragrance
of burning leaves meant that winter was only just round the
corner. Bond had nothing on his mind except the frustration
of waiting for Station Z somehow to penetrate the reserves of
the Swiss Sécurité and come up with the exact address of
Blofeld. But their ‘friends’ in Zürich were continuing to
prove obtuse, or, more probably, obstinate. There was no
trace of any man, either tourist or resident, called Blofeld in
the whole of Switzerland. Nor was there any evidence of the
existence of a reborn <span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">SPECTRE</span></span> on Swiss soil. Yes, they fully
realized that Blofeld was still urgently ‘wanted’ by the
governments of the NATO alliance. They had carefully filed
all the circulars devoted to the apprehension of this man,
and for the past year he had been constantly reconfirmed on
their ‘watch’ lists at all frontier posts. They were very sorry,
but unless the SIS could come up with further information
or evidence about this man, they must assume that the SIS
was acting on mistaken evidence. Station Z had asked for an
examination of the secret lists at the banks, a search through
those anonymous ‘numbered’ accounts which conceal the
owners of most of the fugitive money in the world. This
request had been peremptorily refused. Blofeld was certainly
a great criminal, but the Sécurité must point out that such
information could only be legally obtained if the criminal in
question was guilty of some crime committed on Federal soil
and indictable under the Federal Code. It was true that this
Blofeld had held up Britain and America to ransom by his
illegal possession of atomic weapons. But this could not
be considered a crime under the laws of Switzerland, and
particularly not having regard to Article 47<span class="calibre2">B</span> of the banking
laws. So that was that! The Holy Franc, and the funds
which backed it, wherever they came from, must remain
untouchable. Wir bitten höflichst um Entschuldigung!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond wondered if he should get in touch with Marc-Ange.
So far, in his report, he had revealed only a lead into
the Union Corse, whom he gave, corporately, as the source
of his information. But he shied away from this course of
action, which would surely have, as one consequence, the reopening
with Marc-Ange of the case of Tracy. And that
corner of his life, of his heart, he wanted to leave undisturbed
for the time being. Their last evening together had passed
quietly, almost as if they had been old friends, old lovers.
Bond had said that Universal Export was sending him abroad
for some time. They would certainly meet when he returned
to Europe. The girl had accepted this arrangement. She herself
had decided to go away for a rest. She had been doing
too much. She had been on the verge of a nervous breakdown.
She would wait for him. Perhaps they could go skiing
together around Christmas time? Bond had been enthusiastic.
That night, after a wonderful dinner at Bond’s
little restaurant, they had made love, happily, and this time
without desperation, without tears. Bond was satisfied that
the cure had really begun. He felt deeply protective towards
her. But he knew that their relationship, and her equanimity,
rested on a knife-edge which must not be disturbed.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was at this moment in his reflections that the Syncraphone
in his trouser pocket began to bleep. Bond accelerated
out of the park and drew up beside the public telephone
booth at Marble Arch. The Syncraphone had recently been
introduced and was carried by all officers attached to Headquarters.
It was a light plastic radio receiver about the size
of a pocket watch. When an officer was somewhere in
London, within a range of ten miles of Headquarters, he
could be bleeped on the receiver. When this happened, it was
his duty to go at once to the nearest telephone and contact
his office. He was urgently needed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond rang his exchange on the only outside number he
was allowed to use, said ‘007 reporting,’ and was at once
put through, to his secretary. She was a new one. Loelia
Ponsonby had at last left to marry a dull, but worthy and
rich member of the Baltic Exchange, and confined her contacts
with her old job to rather yearning Christmas and birthday
cards to the members of the Double-O Section. But the
new one, Mary Goodnight, an ex-Wren with blue-black
hair, blue eyes, and 37-22-35, was a honey and there was a
private five-pound sweep in the Section as to who would get
her first. Bond had been lying equal favourite with the ex-Royal
Marine Commando who was 006 but, since Tracy,
had dropped out of the field and now regarded himself as a
rank outsider, though he still, rather bitchily, flirted with her.
Now he said to her, ‘Good morning, Goodnight. What can I
do for you? Is it war or peace?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She giggled unprofessionally. ‘It sounds fairly peaceful,
as peaceful as a hurry message from upstairs can be. You’re
to go at once to the College of Arms and ask for Griffon Or.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Or what?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Just Or. Oh, and he’s Pursuivant as well, whatever that
means. He’s one of the Heralds. Apparently they’ve got some
kind of a line on “Bedlam”.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Bedlam’ was the code name for the pursuit of Blofeld.
Bond said respectfully, ‘Have they indeed? Then I’d better
get cracking. Goodbye, Goodnight.’ He heard her giggle
before he put the receiver down.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now what the hell? Bond got back into his car, that had
mercifully not yet attracted the police or the traffic wardens,
and motored fast across London. This was a queer one. How
the hell did the College of Arms, of which he knew very little
except that they hunted up people’s family trees, allotted
coats of arms, and organized various royal ceremonies, get
into the act?</p>

<p class="pindent">The College of Arms is in Queen Victoria Street on the
fringe of the City. It is a pleasant little Queen Anne backwater
in ancient red brick with white sashed windows and
a convenient cobbled courtyard, where Bond parked his car.
There are horseshoe-shaped stone stairs leading up to an
impressive entrance, over which, that day, there hung a
banner showing a splendid heraldic beast, half animal and
half bird, in gold against a pale blue background. Griffon,
thought Bond. Made of Or. He went through the door into
a large gloomy hall whose dark panelling was lined with the
musty portraits of proud-looking gentlemen in ruffs and
lace, and from whose cornice hung the banners of the
Commonwealth. The porter, a kindly, soft-spoken man in a
cherry-coloured uniform with brass buttons, asked Bond
what he could do for him. Bond asked for the Griffon Or
and confirmed that he had an appointment.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ah yes, sir,’ said the porter mysteriously. ‘Griffon Or is in
waiting this week. That is why his banner is flying outside.
This way please, sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond followed the porter along a passage hung with gleaming
coats of arms in carved wood, up a dank, cobwebby
staircase, and round a corner to a heavy door over which was
written in gold ‘Griffon Or Pursuivant’ under a representation
of the said golden griffon. The porter knocked, opened
the door and announced Bond, and left him facing, across an
unkempt study littered with books, papers, and important-looking
inscribed parchments, the top of a bald, round pink
head fringed with grizzled curls. The room smelt like the
crypt of a church. Bond walked down the narrow lane of
carpet left between the piles of litter and stood beside the
single chair that faced the man behind the books on the desk.
He cleared his throat. The man looked up and the Pickwickian,
pince-nez’d face broke into an absent smile. He got
to his feet and made a little bow. ‘Bond,’ he said in a voice
that creaked like the lid of an old chest. ‘Commander James
Bond. Now then, Bond, Bond, Bond. I think I’ve got you
here.’ He had kept his finger at the open page of a vast tome.
He now sat down and Bond followed suit. ‘Yes, yes, yes.
Very interesting indeed. Very. But I fear I have to disappoint
you, my dear sir. The title is extinct. Actually it’s a
baronetcy. Most desirable. But no doubt we can establish a
relationship through a collateral branch. Now then’—he put
his pince-nez very close to the page—‘we have some ten
different families of Bonds. The important one ended with
Sir Thomas Bond, a most distinguished gentleman. He
resided in Peckham. He had, alas, no issue’—the pince-nez
gleamed encouragingly at Bond—‘no legitimate issue that is.
Of course in those days, ahem, morals were inclined to be
laxer. Now if we could establish some connexion with
Peckham . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I have no connexion with Peckham. Now, I . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">Griffon Or held up his hand. He said severely, ‘Where did
your parents come from, if I may ask? That, my dear fellow,
is the first step in the chain. Then we can go back from there—Somerset
House, parish records, old tomb-stones. No doubt,
with a good old English name like yours, we will get somewhere
in the end.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My father was a Scot and my mother was Swiss. But the
point is . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Quite, quite. You are wondering about the cost of the
research. That, my dear fellow, we can leave until later.
But, now tell me. From whereabouts in Scotland did your
father come? That is important. The Scottish records are
of course less fully documented than those from the South.
In those days I am forced to admit that our cousins across
the border were little more than savages.’ Griffon Or bobbed
his head politely. He gave a fleeting and, to Bond’s eye, rather
false smile. ‘Very pleasant savages, of course, very brave
and all that. But, alas, very weak at keeping up their records.
More useful with the sword than with the pen, if I may say
so. But perhaps your grandparents and their forebears came
from the South?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My father came from the Highlands, from near Glencoe.
But look here . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">But Griffon Or was not to be diverted from the scent.
He pulled another thick book towards him. His finger ran
down the page of small print. ‘Hum. Hum. Hum. Yes, yes.
Not very encouraging, I fear. <span class="it">Burke’s General Armory</span> gives
more than ten different families bearing your name. But,
alas, nothing in Scotland. Not that that means there is no
Scottish branch. Now, perhaps you have other relatives
living. So often in these matters there is some distant
cousin . . .’ Griffon Or reached into the pocket of the purple-flowered
silk waistcoat that buttoned almost up to his neat
bow tie, fished out a small silver snuff-box, offered it to Bond
and then himself took two tremendous sniffs. He exploded
twice into an ornate bandana handkerchief.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took his opportunity. He leaned forward and said
distinctly and forcibly, ‘I didn’t come here to talk about
myself. It’s about Blofeld.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What’s that?’ Griffon Or looked at him in astonishment.
‘You are not interested in your line of descent?’ He held
up an admonishing finger. ‘Do you realize, my dear fellow,
that if we are successful, you may be able to claim direct’—he
hesitated—‘or at any rate collateral descent from an ancient
baronetcy founded’—he went back to his first volume and
peered at it—‘in the year 1658! Does it not excite you that a
possible ancestor of yours was responsible for the name of
one of the most famous streets in the world—I refer of course
to Bond Street? That was the Sir Thomas Bond, Baronet of
Peckham in the County of Surrey, who, as you are no doubt
aware, was Comptroller of the household of the Queen
Mother, Henrietta Maria. The street was built in 1686 and
its associations with famous British folk are, of course, well
known. The first Duke of St Albans, son of Nell Gwynn,
lived there, as did Laurence Sterne. Boswell’s famous dinner
party took place there, with Johnson, Reynolds, Goldsmith,
and Garrick being present. Dean Swift and Canning were
residents at different times, and it is intriguing to recall that
while Lord Nelson lived at number 141, Lady Hamilton
lived at number 145. And this, my dear sir, is the great
thoroughfare of which you bear the name! Do you still wish
to establish no claim to this vastly distinguished connexion?
No?’ The bushy eyebrows, raised in astonishment, were now
lowered in further admonishment. ‘This is the very warp
and woof of history, my dear Commander Bond.’ He reached
for another volume that lay open on his desk and that he had
obviously prepared for Bond’s delectation. ‘The coat of arms,
for instance. Surely that must concern you, be at least of
profound interest to your family, to your own children?
Yes, here we are. “Argent on a chevron sable three bezants”.’
He held up the book so that Bond could see. ‘A bezant is a
golden ball, as I am sure you know. Three balls.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond commented drily, ‘That is certainly a valuable
bonus’—the irony was lost on Griffon Or—‘but I’m afraid
I am still not interested. And I have no relatives and no
children. Now about this man . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">Griffon Or broke in excitedly, ‘And this charming motto
of the line, “The World is not Enough”. You do not wish to
have the right to it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It is an excellent motto which I shall certainly adopt,’
said Bond curtly. He looked pointedly at his watch. ‘Now,
I’m afraid we really must get down to business. I have to
report back to my Ministry.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Griffon Or Pursuivant looked genuinely affronted. ‘And
here is a name going back at least to Norman le Bond in
1180! A fine old English name, though one perhaps originally
of lowly origin. The <span class="it">Dictionary of British Surnames</span> suggests
that the meaning is clearly “husbandman, peasant, churl”.’
Was there an edge of malice in the Griffon’s watery eye?
He added with resignation, ‘But, if you are not interested in
your ancestry, in the womb of your family, then, my dear sir,
in what can I be of service?’</p>

<p class="pindent">At last! James Bond let out a sigh of relief. He said
patiently, ‘I came here to inquire about a certain Blofeld,
Ernst Stavro Blofeld. It seems that your organization has
some information about this man.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Griffon Or’s eyes were suddenly suspicious. ‘But you
represented yourself as a Commander James Bond. And now
the name is Blofeld. How does this come about?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said icily, ‘I am from the Ministry of Defence.
Somewhere in this building is information about a man called
Blofeld. Where can I find it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Griffon Or ran a puzzled hand round his halo of curls.
‘Blofeld, is it? Well, well.’ He looked accusingly at Bond.
‘Forgive me, but you certainly have wasted plenty of my,
of the College’s time, Commander Bond. It is a mystery
to me why you did not mention this man’s name before.
Now let me see, Blofeld, Blofeld. Seem to recall that it came
up at one of our Chapter meetings the other day. Now who
had the case? Ah, yes.’ He reached for a telephone among the
nest of books and papers. ‘Give me Sable Basilisk.’</p>
