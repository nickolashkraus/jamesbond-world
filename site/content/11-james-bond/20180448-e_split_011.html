<p class="line7"><span class="sc"><span class="gesp">James Bond’s</span></span> heart was still in his boots as he was conducted
again through the musty corridors. Sable Basilisk
indeed! What kind of a besotted old fogy would this be?</p>

<p class="pindent">There came another heavy door with the name in gold
and this time with a nightmare black monster, with a vicious
beak above it. But now Bond was shown into a light, clean,
pleasantly furnished room with attractive prints on the walls
and meticulous order among its books. There was a faint
smell of Turkish tobacco. A young man, a few years younger
than Bond, got up and came across the room to meet him.
He was rapier-slim, with a fine, thin, studious face that was
saved from seriousness by wry lines at the edges of the
mouth and an ironical glint in the level eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Commander Bond?’ The handshake was brief and firm.
‘I’d been expecting you. How did you get into the claws of
our dear Griffon? He’s a bit of an enthusiast, I’m afraid. We
all are here, of course. But he’s getting on. Nice chap, but
he’s a bit dedicated, if you know what I mean.’</p>

<p class="pindent">It was indeed like a college, this place, reflected Bond.
Much of the atmosphere one associates with the Senior
Common Room at a University. No doubt Griffon Or
mentally put down Sable Basilisk as a young dilettante who
was too big for his boots. He said, ‘He seemed very anxious
to establish a connexion between me and Bond Street. It
took some time to persuade him that I’m perfectly content
to be an ordinary Bond, which, by the way, he, rather
churlishly I thought, said meant “a churl”.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Sable Basilisk laughed. He sat down behind his desk,
pulled a file towards him, and gestured Bond to a chair
beside him. ‘Well, then. Let’s get down to business. First of
all’—he looked Bond very straight in the eye—‘I gather,
I guess that is, that this is an Intelligence matter of some
kind. I did my national service with Intelligence in BAOR,
so please don’t worry about security. Secondly, we have in
this building probably as many secrets as a government
department—and nastier ones at that. One of our jobs is to
suggest titles to people who’ve been ennobled in the Honours
Lists. Sometimes we’re asked to establish ownership to a
title that has become lost or defunct. Snobbery and vanity
positively sprawl through our files. Before my time, a certain
gentleman who had come up from nowhere, made millions
in some light industry or another, and had been given a
peerage “for political and public services”—i.e., charities
and the party funds—suggested that he should take the title
of Lord Bentley Royal, after the village in Essex. We explained
that the word Royal could not be used except by the
reigning family, but, rather naughtily I fear, we said that
“Lord Bentley Common” was vacant.’ He smiled. ‘See
what I mean? If that got about, this man would become the
laughing-stock of the country. Then sometimes we have to
chase up lost fortunes. So-and-so thinks he’s the rightful
Duke of Blank and ought to have his money. His name
happens to be Blank and his ancestors migrated to America
or Australia or somewhere. So avarice and greed come to
join snobbery and vanity in these rooms. Of course,’ he
added, putting the record straight, ‘that’s only the submerged
tenth of our job. The rest is mostly official stuff for governments
and embassies—problems of precedence and protocol,
the Garter ceremonies, and others. We’ve been doing it for
around five hundred years so I suppose it’s got its place in
the scheme of things.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course it has,’ said Bond staunchly. ‘And certainly, so
far as security is concerned, I’m sure we can be open with
each other. Now this man Blofeld. Truth of the matter is
he’s probably the biggest crook in the world. Remember
that Thunderball affair about a year ago? Only some of it
leaked into the papers, but I can tell you that this Blofeld
was at the bottom of it all. Now, how did you come to hear
of him? Every detail, please. Everything about him is important.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Sable Basilisk turned back to the first letter on the file.
‘Yes,’ he said thoughtfully, ‘I thought this might be the
same chap when I got a lot of urgent calls from the Foreign
Office and the Ministry of Defence yesterday. Hadn’t
occurred to me before, I’m afraid, that this is a case where
our secrets have to come second, or I’d have done something
about it earlier. Now then, in June last, the tenth, we got
this confidential letter from a firm of respectable Zürich
solicitors, dated the day before. I’ll read it out:</p>

<div class="blockquote-right90percent">

<p class="line7">‘Honoured Sirs,</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We have a valued client by the name of Ernst Stavro
Blofeld. This gentleman styles himself Monsieur le Comte
Balthazar de Bleuville in the belief that he is the rightful
heir to this title which we understand to be extinct. His
belief is based on stories he heard from his parents in
childhood to the effect that his family fled France at the
time of the Revolution, settled in Germany under the
adopted name of Blofeld, assumed in order to evade the
Revolutionary authorities and safeguard their fortune
which they had sequestered in Augsburg, and subsequently,
in the 1850’s, migrated to Poland.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Our client is now anxious to have these facts established
in order legally to obtain right to the de Bleuville
title supported by an Acte de Notoriété which would in
due course receive the stamp of approval of the Ministère
de la Justice in Paris.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘In the meantime, our client proposes to continue to
adopt, albeit provisionally, the title of Comte de Bleuville
together with the family arms which he informs us are
“Argent four fusils in fesse gules” and the de Bleuville
motto which, in English, is “For Hearth and Home”.’</p>

</div>

<p class="line7">‘That’s a good one!’ interjected Bond. Sable Basilisk smiled
and continued:</p>

<div class="blockquote-right90percent">

<p class="pindent">‘We understand that you, honoured Sirs, are the only
body in the world who is capable of undertaking this
research work and we have been instructed to get in touch
with you <span class="it">under the strictest conditions of confidence</span>, which,
in view of the social aspects involved, we think we have
the right to request.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The financial standing of our client is impeccable and
expense is no object in this matter. As a preliminary
honorarium and upon acceptance of this commission, we
propose a payment of one thousand pounds sterling to your
account in such bank as you may designate.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Awaiting the favour of an early reply, we remain,
honoured sirs etc. etc., Gebrüder Gumpold-Moosbrugger,
Advokaten, 16 bis, Bahnhofstrasse, Zürich.’</p>

</div>

<p class="pindent">Sable Basilisk looked up. James Bond’s eyes were glittering
with excitement. Sable Basilisk smiled. ‘We were even more
interested than you seem to be. You see, to let you in on a
secret, our salaries are extremely modest. So we all have
private means which we supplement from fees received for
special work like this. These fees rarely go above fifty guineas
for a piece of pretty tough research and all the leg work at
Somerset House and in parish records and graveyards that
is usually involved in tracking a man’s ancestry. So this looked
like a real challenge for the College, and as I was “in waiting”
the day the letter came in, sort of “officer of the watch”,
the job fell into my lap.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said urgently, ‘So what happened? Have you kept
the contact?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh yes, but rather tenuously, I’m afraid. Of course I
wrote at once accepting the commission and agreeing to the
vow of secrecy which’—he smiled—‘you now force me to
break presumably by invoking the Official Secrets Act. That
is so, isn’t it? I am acting under force majeure?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You are indeed,’ said Bond emphatically.</p>

<p class="pindent">Sable Basilisk made a careful note on the top paper in the
file and continued. ‘Of course the first thing I had to ask
for was the man’s birth certificate and, after a delay, I was
told that it had been lost and that I was on no account to
worry about it. The Count had in fact been born in Gdynia
of a Polish father and a Greek mother—I have the names
here—on May 28th, 1908. Could I not pursue my researches
backwards from the de Bleuville end? I replied temporizing,
but by this time I had indeed established from our library
that there had been a family of de Bleuvilles, at least as lately
as the seventeenth century, at a place called Blonville-sur-Mer,
Calvados, and that their arms and motto were as
claimed by Blofeld.’ Sable Basilisk paused. ‘This of course
he must have known for himself. There would have been no
purpose in inventing a family of de Bleuvilles and trying to
stuff them down our throats. I told the lawyers of my discovery
and, in my summer holidays—the North of France is
more or less my private heraldic beat, so to speak, and very
rich it is too in connexions with England—I motored down
there and sniffed around. But meanwhile I had, as a matter
of routine, written to our Ambassador in Warsaw and asked
him to contact our Consul in Gdynia and request him to
employ a lawyer to make the simple researches with the
Registrar and the various churches where Blofeld might
have been baptized. The reply, early in September, was, but
is no longer, surprising. The pages containing the record of
Blofeld’s birth had been neatly cut out. I kept this information
to myself, that is to say I did not pass it on to the Swiss
lawyers because I had been expressly instructed to make no
inquiries in Poland. Meanwhile I had carried out similar
inquiries through a lawyer in Augsburg. There, there was
indeed a record of Blofelds, but of a profusion of them,
for it is a fairly common German name, and in any case
nothing to link any of them with the de Bleuvilles from
Calvados. So I was stumped, but no more than I have been
before, and I wrote a neutral report to the Swiss lawyers and
said that I was continuing my researches. And there’—Sable
Basilisk slapped the file shut—‘until my telephone began
ringing yesterday, presumably because someone in the
Northern Department of the Foreign Office was checking
the file copies from Warsaw and the name Blofeld rang a bell,
and you appeared looking very impatient from the cave of
my friend the Griffon, the case rests.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond scratched his head thoughtfully. ‘But the ball’s still
in play?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh yes, definitely.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Can you keep it in play? I take it you haven’t got Blofeld’s
present address?’ Sable Basilisk shook his head. ‘Then
would there be any conceivable excuse for an envoy from
you?’ Bond smiled. ‘Me, for example, to be sent out from the
College to have an interview with Blofeld—some tricky point
that cannot be cleared up by correspondence, something that
needs a personal inquiry from Blofeld?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, yes, there is in a way.’ Sable Basilisk looked rather
dubious. ‘You see, in some families there is a strong physical
characteristic that goes on inevitably from generation to
generation. The Habsburg lip is a case in point. So is the
tendency to haemophilia among descendants of the Bourbons.
The hawk nose of the Medici is another. A certain royal
family have minute, vestigial tails. The original maharajahs
of Mysore were born with six fingers on each hand. I could
go on indefinitely, but those are the most famous cases.
Now, when I was scratching around in the crypt of the chapel
at Blonville, having a look at the old Bleuville tombs, my
flashlight, moving over the stone faces, picked out a curious
fact that I tucked away in my mind but that your question has
brought to the surface. None of the de Bleuvilles, as far as I
could tell, and certainly not through a hundred and fifty
years, had lobes to their ears.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ah,’ said Bond, running over in his mind the Identicast
picture of Blofeld and the complete, printed physiognometry
of the man in Records. ‘So he shouldn’t by rights have lobes
to his ears. Or at any rate it would be a strong piece of
evidence for his case if he hadn’t?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s right.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, he <span class="it">has</span> got lobes,’ said Bond, annoyed. ‘Rather
pronounced lobes as a matter of fact. Where does that get us?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘To begin with, added to what I know anyway, that makes
him probably not a de Bleuville. But after all’—Sable Basilisk
looked sly—‘there’s no reason why he should know what
physical characteristic we’re looking for in this interview.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You think we could set one up?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t see why not. But’—Sable Basilisk was apologetic—‘would
you mind if I got clearance from Garter King of
Arms? He’s my boss, so to speak, under the Duke of Norfolk
that is, the Earl Marshal, and I can’t remember that we’ve
ever been mixed up in this sort of cloak-and-dagger stuff
before. Actually’—Sable Basilisk waved a deprecating hand—‘we
are, we have to be, damned meticulous. You do see that,
don’t you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Naturally. And I’m sure there’d be no objection. But,
even if Blofeld agreed to see me, how in hell could I play
the part? This stuff is all double Dutch to me.’ He smiled.
‘I don’t know the difference between a gule and a bezant
and I’ve never been able to make out what a baronet is.
What’s my story to Blofeld? Who am I exactly?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Sable Basilisk was getting enthusiastic. He said cheerfully,
‘Oh that’ll be all right. I’ll coach you in all the dope about
the de Bleuvilles. You can easily mug up a few popular
books on heraldry. It’s not difficult to be impressive on the
subject. Very few people know anything about it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Maybe. But this Blofeld is a pretty smart animal. He’ll
want the hell of a lot of credentials before he sees anyone
but his lawyer and his banker. Who exactly am I?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You think Blofeld’s smart because you’ve seen the smart
side of him,’ said Sable Basilisk sapiently. ‘I’ve seen hundreds
of smart people from the City, industry, politics—famous
people I’ve been quite frightened to meet when they walked
into this room. But when it comes to snobbery, to buying
respectability so to speak, whether it’s the title they’re going
to choose or just a coat of arms to hang over their fire-places
in Surbiton, they dwindle and dwindle in front of you’—he
made a downward motion over his desk with his hand—‘until
they’re no bigger than homunculi. And the women are even
worse. The idea of suddenly becoming a “lady” in their
small community is so intoxicating that the way they bare
their souls is positively obscene. It’s as if’—Sable Basilisk
furrowed his high, pale brow, seeking for a simile—‘these
fundamentally good citizens, these Smiths and Browns and
Joneses and’—he smiled across the desk—‘Bonds, regarded
the process of ennoblement as a sort of laying-on of hands,
a way of ridding themselves of all the drabness of their lives,
of all their, so to speak, essential meagreness, their basic
inferiority. Don’t worry about Blofeld. He has already
swallowed the bait. He may be a tremendous gangster, and
he must be from what I remember of the case. He may be
tough and ruthless in his corner of human behaviour. But if
he is trying to prove that he is the Comte de Bleuville, you
can be sure of various things. He wants to change his name.
That is obvious. He wants to become a new, a respectable
personality. That is obvious too. But above all he wants to
become a Count.’ Sable Basilisk brought his hand flat down
on his desk for emphasis. ‘That, Mr Bond, is tremendously
significant. He is a rich and successful man in his line of
business—no matter what it is. He no longer admires the
material things, riches and power. He is now 54, as I reckon
it. He wants a new skin. I can assure you, Mr Bond, that he
will receive you, if we play our cards right that is, as if he
were consulting his doctor about’—Sable Basilisk’s aristocratic
face took on an expression of distaste—‘as if he were
consulting his doctor after contracting V.D.’ Sable Basilisk’s
eyes were now compelling. He sat back in his chair and lit his
first cigarette. The smell of Turkish tobacco drifted across to
Bond. ‘That’s it,’ he said with certitude. ‘This man knows
he is unclean, a social pariah. Which of course he is. Now
he has thought up this way of buying himself a new identity.
If you ask me, we must help the hair to grow and flourish
on his heel of Achilles until it is so luxuriant that he trips
on it.’</p>
