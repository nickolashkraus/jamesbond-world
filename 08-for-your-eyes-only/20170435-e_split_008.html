<p class="line19">———— * ————</p>

<p class="line2"><span class="sc">The</span> most beautiful bird in Jamaica, and some say the
most beautiful bird in the world, is the streamer-tail
or doctor humming-bird. The cock bird is about nine
inches long, but seven inches of it are tail—two long
black feathers that curve and cross each other and
whose inner edges are in a form of scalloped design.
The head and crest are black, the wings dark green,
the long bill is scarlet, and the eyes, bright and confiding,
are black. The body is emerald green, so dazzling
that when the sun is on the breast you see the
brightest green thing in nature. In Jamaica, birds that
are loved are given nicknames. <span class="it">Trochilus polytmus</span> is
called ‘doctor bird’ because his two black streamers
remind people of the black tail-coat of the old-time
physician.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Havelock was particularly devoted to two
families of these birds because she had been watching
them sipping honey, fighting, nesting and making love
since she married, and came to Content. She was now
over fifty, so many generations of these two families
had come and gone since the original two pairs had
been nicknamed Pyramus and Thisbe and Daphnis
and Chloe by her mother-in-law. But successive
couples had kept the names, and Mrs Havelock now
sat at her elegant tea service on the broad cool veranda
and watched Pyramus, with a fierce ‘tee-tee-tee’, dive-bomb
Daphnis who had finished up the honey on his
own huge bush of Japanese Hat and had sneaked in
among the neighbouring Monkeyfiddle that was Pyramus’s
preserve. The two tiny black and green comets
swirled away across the fine acres of lawn, dotted with
brilliant clumps of hibiscus and bougainvillaea, until
they were lost to sight in the citrus groves. They would
soon be back. The running battle between the two
families was a game. In this big finely planted garden
there was enough honey for all.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Havelock put down her teacup and took a
Patum Peperium sandwich. She said: ‘They really are
the most dreadful show-offs.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colonel Havelock looked over the top of his <span class="it">Daily
Gleaner</span>. ‘Who?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Pyramus and Daphnis.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, yes.’ Colonel Havelock thought the names
idiotic. He said: ‘It looks to me as if Batista will be on
the run soon. Castro’s keeping up the pressure pretty
well. Chap at Barclay’s told me this morning that
there’s a lot of funk money coming over here already.
Said that Belair’s been sold to nominees. One hundred
and fifty thousand pounds for a thousand acres of
cattle-tick and a house the red ants’ll have down by
Christmas! Somebody’s suddenly gone and bought
that ghastly Blue Harbour hotel, and there’s even talk
that Jimmy Farquharson has found a buyer for his
place—leaf-spot and Panama disease thrown in for
good measure, I suppose.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’ll be nice for Ursula. The poor dear can’t
stand it out here. But I can’t say I like the idea of the
whole island being bought up by these Cubans. But
Tim, where do they get all the money from, anyway?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Rackets, union funds, Government money—God
knows. The place is riddled with crooks and gangsters.
They must want to get their money out of Cuba and
into something else quick. Jamaica’s as good as anywhere
else now we’ve got this convertibility with the
dollar. Apparently the man who bought Belair just
shovelled the money on to the floor of Aschenheim’s
office out of a suitcase. I suppose he’ll keep the place
for a year or two, and when the trouble’s blown over
or when Castro’s got in and finished cleaning up he’ll
put it on the market again, take a reasonable loss and
move off somewhere else. Pity, in a way. Belair used
to be a fine property. It could have been brought back
if anyone in the family had cared.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It was ten thousand acres in Bill’s grandfather’s
day. It used to take the busher three days to ride the
boundary.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Fat lot Bill cares. I bet he’s booked his passage to
London already. That’s one more of the old families
gone. Soon won’t be anyone left of that lot but us.
Thank God Judy likes the place.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Havelock said ‘Yes, dear’ calmingly and pinged
the bell for the tea-things to be cleared away. Agatha,
a huge blue-black Negress wearing the old-fashioned
white headcloth that has gone out in Jamaica except
in the hinterland, came out through the white and
rose drawing-room followed by Fayprince, a pretty
young quadroon from Port Maria whom she was training
as second housemaid. Mrs Havelock said: ‘It’s
time we started bottling, Agatha. The guavas are early
this year.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Agatha’s face was impassive. She said: ‘Yes’m. But
we done need more bottles.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Why? It was only last year I got you two dozen of
the best I could find at Henriques.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes’m. Someone done mash five, six of dose.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh dear. How did that happen?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Couldn’t say’m.’ Agatha picked up the big silver
tray and waited, watching Mrs Havelock’s face.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Havelock had not lived most of her life in Jamaica
without learning that a mash is a mash and that
one would not get anywhere hunting for a culprit. So
she just said cheerfully: ‘Oh, all right, Agatha. I’ll get
some more when I go into Kingston.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes’m.’ Agatha, followed by the young girl, went
back into the house.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Havelock picked up a piece of petit-point and
began stitching, her fingers moving automatically. Her
eyes went back to the big bushes of Japanese Hat and
Monkeyfiddle. Yes, the two male birds were back.
With gracefully cocked tails they moved among the
flowers. The sun was low on the horizon and every now
and then there was a flash of almost piercingly beautiful
green. A mocking-bird, on the topmost branch of a
frangipani, started on its evening repertoire. The tinkle
of an early tree-frog announced the beginning of the
short violet dusk.</p>

<p class="pindent">Content, twenty thousand acres in the foothills of
Candlefly Peak, one of the most easterly of the Blue
Mountains in the county of Portland, had been given
to an early Havelock by Oliver Cromwell as a reward
for having been one of the signatories to King Charles’s
death warrant. Unlike so many other settlers of those
and later times the Havelocks had maintained the
plantation through three centuries, through earthquakes
and hurricanes and through the boom and bust
of cocoa, sugar, citrus and copra. Now it was in bananas
and cattle, and it was one of the richest and best
run of all the private estates in the island. The house,
patched up or rebuilt after earthquake or hurricane,
was a hybrid—a mahogany-pillared, two-storeyed
central block on the old stone foundations flanked by
two single-storeyed wings with widely overhung, flat-pitched
Jamaican roofs of silver cedar shingles. The
Havelocks were now sitting on the deep veranda of the
central block facing the gently sloping garden beyond
which a vast tumbling jungle vista stretched away
twenty miles to the sea.</p>

<p class="pindent">Colonel Havelock put down his <span class="it">Gleaner</span>. ‘I thought I
heard a car.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Havelock said firmly: ‘If it’s those ghastly Feddens
from Port Antonio, you’ve simply got to get rid
of them. I can’t stand any more of their moans about
England. And last time they were both quite drunk
when they left and dinner was cold.’ She got up quickly.
‘I’m going to tell Agatha to say I’ve got a migraine.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Agatha came out through the drawing-room door.
She looked fussed. She was followed closely by three
men. She said hurriedly: ‘Gemmun from Kingston’m.
To see de Colonel.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The leading man slid past the housekeeper. He was
still wearing his hat, a panama with a short very up-curled
brim. He took this off with his left hand and
held it against his stomach. The rays of the sun glittered
on hair-grease and on a mouthful of smiling
white teeth. He went up to Colonel Havelock, his outstretched
hand held straight in front of him. ‘Major
Gonzales. From Havana. Pleased to meet you,
Colonel.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The accent was the sham American of a Jamaican
taxi-driver. Colonel Havelock had got to his feet. He
touched the outstretched hand briefly. He looked over
the Major’s shoulder at the other two men who had
stationed themselves on either side of the door. They
were both carrying that new holdall of the tropics—a
Pan American overnight bag. The bags looked heavy.
Now the two men bent down together and placed
them beside their yellowish shoes. They straightened
themselves. They wore flat white caps with transparent
green visors that cast green shadows down to their
cheek-bones. Through the green shadows their intelligent
animal eyes fixed themselves on the Major,
reading his behaviour.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘They are my secretaries.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colonel Havelock took a pipe out of his pocket and
began to fill it. His direct blue eyes took in the sharp
clothes, the natty shoes, the glistening finger-nails of
the Major and the blue jeans and calypso shirts of the
other two. He wondered how he could get these men
into his study and near the revolver in the top drawer
of his desk. He said: ‘What can I do for you?’ As he lit
his pipe he watched the Major’s eyes and mouth
through the smoke.</p>

<p class="pindent">Major Gonzales spread his hands. The width of his
smile remained constant. The liquid, almost golden
eyes were amused, friendly. ‘It is a matter of business,
Colonel. I represent a certain gentleman in Havana’—he
made a throw-away gesture with his right hand.
‘A powerful gentleman. A very fine guy.’ Major Gonzales
assumed an expression of sincerity. ‘You would
like him Colonel. He asked me to present his compliments
and to inquire the price of your property.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Havelock, who had been watching the scene
with a polite half-smile on her lips, moved to stand
beside her husband. She said kindly, so as not to embarrass
the poor man: ‘What a shame, Major. All this
way on these dusty roads! Your friend really should
have written first, or asked anyone in Kingston or at
Government House. You see, my husband’s family
have lived here for nearly three hundred years.’ She
looked at him sweetly, apologetically. ‘I’m afraid there
just isn’t any question of selling Content. There never
has been. I wonder where your important friend can
possibly have got the idea from.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Major Gonzales bowed briefly. His smiling face
turned back to Colonel Havelock. He said, as if Mrs
Havelock had not opened her mouth: ‘My gentleman
is told this is one of the finest estancias in Jamaica. He
is a most generous man. You may mention any sum
that is reasonable.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colonel Havelock said firmly: ‘You heard what Mrs
Havelock said. The property is not for sale.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Major Gonzales laughed. It sounded quite genuine
laughter. He shook his head as if he was explaining
something to a rather dense child. ‘You misunderstand
me, Colonel. My gentleman desires this property and
no other property in Jamaica. He has some funds, some
extra funds, to invest. These funds are seeking a
home in Jamaica. My gentleman wishes this to be their
home.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colonel Havelock said patiently: ‘I quite understand,
Major. And I am so sorry you have wasted your
time. Content will never be for sale in my lifetime. And
now, if you’ll forgive me. My wife and I always dine
early, and you have a long way to go.’ He made a
gesture to the left, along the veranda. ‘I think you’ll
find this is the quickest way to your car. Let me show
you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colonel Havelock moved invitingly, but when
Major Gonzales stayed where he was, he stopped. The
blue eyes began to freeze.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was perhaps one less tooth in Major Gonzales’s
smile and his eyes had become watchful. But
his manner was still jolly. He said cheerfully, ‘Just one
moment, Colonel.’ He issued a curt order over his
shoulder. Both the Havelocks noticed the jolly mask
slip with the few sharp words through the teeth. For
the first time Mrs Havelock looked slightly uncertain.
She moved still closer to her husband. The two men
picked up their blue Pan American bags and stepped
forward. Major Gonzales reached for the zipper on
each of them in turn and pulled. The taut mouths
sprang open. The bags were full to the brim with neat
solid wads of American money. Major Gonzales spread
his arms. ‘All hundred-dollar bills. All genuine. Half a
million dollars. That is, in your money, let us say, one
hundred and eighty thousand pounds. A small fortune.
There are many other good places to live in the world,
Colonel. And perhaps my gentleman would add a
further twenty thousand pounds to make the round
sum. You would know in a week. All I need is half a
sheet of paper with your signature. The lawyers can
do the rest. Now Colonel,’ the smile was winning,
‘shall we say yes and shake hands on it? Then the bags
stay here and we leave you to your dinner.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Havelocks now looked at the Major with the
same expression—a mixture of anger and disgust. One
could imagine Mrs Havelock telling the story next day.
‘Such a common, greasy little man. And those filthy
plastic bags full of money! Timmy was wonderful. He
just told him to get out and take the dirty stuff away
with him.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colonel Havelock’s mouth turned down with distaste.
He said: ‘I thought I had made myself clear,
Major. The property is not for sale at any price. And I
do not share the popular thirst for American dollars. I
must now ask you to leave.’ Colonel Havelock laid his
cold pipe on the table as if he was preparing to roll up
his sleeves.</p>

<p class="pindent">For the first time Major Gonzales’s smile lost its
warmth. The mouth continued to grin but it was now
shaped in an angry grimace. The liquid golden eyes
were suddenly brassy and hard. He said softly:
‘Colonel. It is I who have not made myself clear. Not
you. My gentleman has instructed me to say that if you
will not accept his most generous terms we must
proceed to other measures.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Havelock was suddenly afraid. She put her
hand on Colonel Havelock’s arm and pressed it hard.
He put his hand over hers in reassurance. He said
through tight lips: ‘Please leave us alone and go,
Major. Otherwise I shall communicate with the
police.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The pink tip of Major Gonzales’s tongue came out
and slowly licked along his lips. All the light had gone
out of his face and it had become taut and hard. He
said harshly. ‘So the property is not for sale in your
lifetime, Colonel. Is that your last word?’ His right
hand went behind his back and he clicked his fingers
softly, once. Behind him the gun-hands of the two men
slid through the opening of their gay shirts above the
waistbands. The sharp animal eyes watched the
Major’s fingers behind his back.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Havelock’s hand went up to her mouth. Colonel
Havelock tried to say yes, but his mouth was dry. He
swallowed noisily. He could not believe it. This mangy
Cuban crook must be bluffing. He managed to say
thickly: ‘Yes, it is.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Major Gonzales nodded curtly. ‘In that case,
Colonel, my gentleman will carry on the negotiations
with the next owner—with your daughter.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The fingers clicked. Major Gonzales stepped to one
side to give a clear field of fire. The brown monkey-hands
came out from under the gay shirts. The ugly
sausage-shaped hunks of metal spat and thudded—again
and again, even when the two bodies were on
their way to the ground.</p>

<p class="pindent">Major Gonzales bent down and verified where the
bullets had hit. Then the three small men walked
quickly back through the rose and white drawing-room
and across the dark carved mahogany hall and
out through the elegant front door. They climbed unhurriedly
into a black Ford Consul Sedan with Jamaican
number plates and, with Major Gonzales
driving and the two gunmen sitting upright in the back
seat, they drove off at an easy pace down the long
avenue of Royal Palms. At the junction of the drive
and the road to Port Antonio the cut telephone wires
hung down through the trees like bright lianas. Major
Gonzales slalomed the car carefully and expertly down
the rough parochial road until he was on the metalled
strip near the coast. Then he put on speed. Twenty
minutes after the killing he came to the outer sprawl of
the little banana port. There he ran the stolen car on
to the grass verge beside the road and the three men
got out and walked the quarter of a mile through the
sparsely lit main street to the banana wharves. The
speed-boat was waiting, its exhaust bubbling. The
three men got in and the boat zoomed off across the
still waters of what an American poetess has called the
most beautiful harbour in the world. The anchor chain
was already half up on the glittering fifty-ton Chris-Craft.
She was flying the Stars and Stripes. The two
graceful antennae of the deep-sea rods explained that
these were tourists—from Kingston, perhaps, or from
Montego Bay. The three men went on board and the
speed-boat was swung in. Two canoes were circling,
begging. Major Gonzales tossed a fifty-cent piece to
each of them and the stripped men dived. The twin
diesels awoke to a stuttering roar and the Chris-Craft
settled her stern down a fraction and made for the
deep channel below the Titchfield hotel. By dawn she
would be back in Havana. The fisherman and wharfingers
ashore watched her go, and went on with
their argument as to which of the film-stars holidaying
in Jamaica this could have been.</p>

<p class="pindent">Up on the broad veranda of Content the last rays of
the sun glittered on the red stains. One of the doctor
birds whirred over the balustrade and hovered close
above Mrs Havelock’s heart, looking down. No, this
was not for him. He flirted gaily off to his roosting-perch
among the closing hibiscus.</p>

<p class="pindent">There came the sound of someone in a small sports
car making a racing change at the bend of the drive.
If Mrs Havelock had been alive she would have been
getting ready to say: ‘Judy, I’m always telling you not
to do that on the corner. It scatters gravel all over the
lawn and you know how it ruins Joshua’s lawnmower.’</p>

<hr class="tbk1"/>

<p class="pindent">It was a month later. In London, October had begun
with a week of brilliant Indian summer, and the
noise of the mowers came up from Regent’s Park and
in through the wide open windows of M’s office. They
were motor-mowers and James Bond reflected that
one of the most beautiful noises of summer, the drowsy
iron song of the old machines, was going for ever from
the world. Perhaps today children felt the same about
the puff and chatter of the little two-stroke engines. At
least the cut grass would smell the same.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had time for these reflections because M
seemed to be having difficulty in coming to the point.
Bond had been asked if he had anything on at the
moment, and he had replied happily that he hadn’t
and had waited for Pandora’s box to be opened for
him. He was mildly intrigued because M had addressed
him as James and not by his number—007.
This was unusual during duty hours. It sounded as if
there might be some personal angle to this assignment—as
if it might be put to him more as a request than
as an order. And it seemed to Bond that there was an
extra small cleft of worry between the frosty, damnably
clear, grey eyes. And three minutes was certainly
too long to spend getting a pipe going.</p>

<p class="pindent">M swivelled his chair round square with the desk
and flung the box of matches down so that it skidded
across the red leather top towards Bond. Bond fielded
it and skidded it politely back to the middle of the
desk. M smiled briefly. He seemed to make up his
mind. He said mildly: ‘James, has it ever occurred to
you that every man in the fleet knows what to do except
the commanding admiral?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond frowned. He said: ‘It hadn’t occurred to me,
sir. But I see what you mean. The rest only have to
carry out orders. The admiral has to decide on the
orders. I suppose it’s the same as saying that Supreme
Command is the loneliest post there is.’</p>

<p class="pindent">M jerked his pipe sideways. ‘Same sort of idea.
Someone’s got to be tough. Someone’s got to decide in
the end. If you send a havering signal to the Admiralty
you deserve to be put on the beach. Some
people are religious—pass the decision on to God.’
M’s eyes were defensive. ‘I used to try that sometimes
in the Service, but He always passed the buck back
again—told me to get on and make up my own mind.
Good for one, I suppose, but tough. Trouble is, very
few people keep tough after about forty. They’ve been
knocked about by life—had troubles, tragedies, illnesses.
These things soften you up.’ M looked sharply
at Bond. ‘How’s your coefficient of toughness, James?
You haven’t got to the dangerous age yet.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond didn’t like personal questions. He didn’t know
what to answer, nor what the truth was. He had not
got a wife or children—had never suffered the tragedy
of a personal loss. He had not had to stand up to blindness
or a mortal disease. He had absolutely no idea
how he would face these things that needed so much
more toughness than he had ever had to show. He said
hesitantly: ‘I suppose I can stand most things if I have
to and if I think it’s right, sir. I mean’—he did not like
using such words—‘if the cause is—er—sort of just,
sir.’ He went on, feeling ashamed at himself for throwing
the ball back at M: ‘Of course it’s not easy to know
what is just and what isn’t. I suppose I assume that
when I’m given an unpleasant job in the Service the
cause is a just one.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Dammit,’ M’s eyes glittered impatiently. ‘That’s
just what I mean! You rely on <span class="it">me</span>. You won’t take any
damned responsibility yourself.’ He thrust the stem of
his pipe towards his chest. ‘I’m the one who has to do
that. I’m the one who has to decide if a thing is right
or not.’ The anger died out of the eyes. The grim mouth
bent sourly. He said gloomily: ‘Oh well, I suppose it’s
what I’m paid for. Somebody’s got to drive the bloody
train.’ M put his pipe back in his mouth and drew
on it deeply to relieve his feelings.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now Bond felt sorry for M. He had never before
heard M use as strong a word as ‘bloody’. Nor had M
ever given a member of his staff any hint that he felt
the weight of the burden he was carrying and had
carried ever since he had thrown up the certain prospect
of becoming Fifth Sea Lord in order to take over
the Secret Service. M had got himself a problem. Bond
wondered what it was. It would not be concerned with
danger. If M could get the odds more or less right he
would risk anything, anywhere in the world. It would
not be political. M did not give a damn for the susceptibilities
of any Ministry and thought nothing of going
behind their backs to get a personal ruling from the
Prime Minister. It might be moral. It might be personal.
Bond said: ‘Is there anything I can help over, sir?’</p>

<p class="pindent">M looked briefly, thoughtfully at Bond, and then
swivelled his chair so that he could look out of the window
at the high summery clouds. He said abruptly:
‘Do you remember the Havelock case?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Only what I read in the papers, sir. Elderly couple
in Jamaica. The daughter came home one night and
found them full of bullets. There was some talk of
gangsters from Havana. The housekeeper said three
men had called in a car. She thought they might have
been Cubans. It turned out the car had been stolen. A
yacht had sailed from the local harbour that night.
But as far as I remember the police didn’t get anywhere.
That’s all, sir. I haven’t seen any signals passing
on the case.’</p>

<p class="pindent">M said gruffly: ‘You wouldn’t have. They’ve been
personal to me. We weren’t asked to handle the case.
Just happens,’ M cleared his throat: this private use
of the Service was on his conscience, ‘I knew the
Havelocks. Matter of fact I was best man at their wedding.
Malta. Nineteen twenty-five.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I see, sir. That’s bad.’</p>

<p class="pindent">M said shortly: ‘Nice people. Anyway, I told Station
C to look into it. They didn’t get anywhere with the
Batista people, but we’ve got a good man with the
other side—with this chap Castro. And Castro’s Intelligence
people seem to have the Government pretty
well penetrated. I got the whole story a couple of weeks
ago. It boils down to the fact that a man called Hammerstein,
or von Hammerstein, had the couple killed.
There are a lot of Germans well dug in in these banana
republics. They’re Nazis who got out of the net at the
end of the War. This one’s ex-Gestapo. He got a job
as head of Batista’s Counter Intelligence. Made a
packet of money out of extortion and blackmail and
protection. He was set up for life until Castro’s lot began
to make headway. He was one of the first to start
easing himself out. He cut one of his officers in on his
loot, a man called Gonzales, and this man travelled
around the Caribbean with a couple of gunmen to
protect him and began salting away Hammerstein’s
money outside Cuba—put it in real estate and suchlike
under nominees. Only bought the best, but at top
prices. Hammerstein could afford them. When money
didn’t work he’d use force—kidnap a child, burn down
a few acres, anything to make the owner see reason.
Well, this man Hammerstein heard of the Havelocks’
property, one of the best in Jamaica, and he told Gonzales
to go and get it. I suppose his orders were to kill
the Havelocks if they wouldn’t sell and then put pressure
on the daughter. There’s a daughter, by the way.
Should be about twenty-five by now. Never seen her
myself. Anyway, that’s what happened. They killed
the Havelocks. Then two weeks ago Batista sacked
Hammerstein. May have got to hear about one of
these jobs. I don’t know. But, anyway, Hammerstein
cleared out and took his little team of three with him.
Timed things pretty well, I should say. It looks as if
Castro may get in this winter if he keeps the pressure up.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said softly: ‘Where have they gone to?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘America. Right up in the North of Vermont. Up
against the Canadian border. Those sort of men like
being close to frontiers. Place called Echo Lake. It’s
some kind of a millionaire’s ranch he’s rented. Looks
pretty from the photographs. Tucked away in the
mountains with this little lake in the grounds. He’s
certainly chosen himself somewhere where he won’t be
troubled with visitors.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How did you get on to this, sir?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I sent a report of the whole case to Edgar Hoover.
He knew of the man. I guessed he would. He’s had a
lot of trouble with this gun-running from Miami to
Castro. And he’s been interested in Havana ever since
the big American gangster money started following the
casinos there. He said that Hammerstein and his party
had come into the States on six months visitors’ visas.
He was very helpful. Wanted to know if I’d got enough
to build up a case on. Did I want these men extradited
for trial in Jamaica? I talked it over here with the
Attorney General and he said there wasn’t a hope unless
we could get the witnesses from Havana. There’s
no chance of that. It was only through Castro’s Intelligence
that we even know as much as we do.
Officially the Cubans won’t raise a finger. Next Hoover
offered to have their visas revoked and get them on the
move again. I thanked him and said no, and we left it
at that.’</p>

<p class="pindent">M sat for a moment in silence. His pipe had died
and he relit it. He went on: ‘I decided to have a talk
with our friends the Mounties. I got on to the Commissioner
on the scrambler. He’s never let me down
yet. He strayed one of his frontier patrol planes over
the border and took a full aerial survey of this Echo
Lake place. Said that if I wanted any other co-operation
he’d provide it. And now,’ M slowly swivelled his
chair back square with the desk, ‘I’ve got to decide
what to do next.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Now Bond realized why M was troubled, why he
wanted someone else to make the decision. Because
these had been friends of M. Because a personal element
was involved, M had worked on the case by himself.
And now it had come to the point when justice
ought to be done and these people brought to book.
But M was thinking: is this justice, or is it revenge? No
judge would take a murder case in which he had personally
known the murdered person. M wanted someone
else, Bond, to deliver judgment. There were no
doubts in Bond’s mind. He didn’t know the Havelocks
or care who they were. Hammerstein had operated the
law of the jungle on two defenceless old people. Since
no other law was available, the law of the jungle
should be visited upon Hammerstein. In no other way
could justice be done. If it was revenge, it was the
revenge of the community.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said: ‘I wouldn’t hesitate for a minute, sir. If
foreign gangsters find they can get away with this kind
of thing they’ll decide the English are as soft as some
other people seem to think we are. This is a case for
rough justice—an eye for an eye.’</p>

<p class="pindent">M went on looking at Bond. He gave no encouragement,
made no comment.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said: ‘These people can’t be hung, sir. But
they ought to be killed.’</p>

<p class="pindent">M’s eyes ceased to focus on Bond. For a moment
they were blank, looking inward. Then he slowly
reached for the top drawer of his desk on the left-hand
side, pulled it open and extracted a thin file without
the usual title across it and without the top secret red
star. He placed the file squarely in front of him and his
hand rummaged again in the open drawer. The hand
brought out a rubber stamp and a red-ink pad. M
opened the pad, tamped the rubber stamp on it and
then carefully, so that it was properly aligned with the
top right-hand corner of the docket, pressed it down
on the grey cover.</p>

<p class="pindent">M replaced the stamp and the ink pad in the drawer
and closed the drawer. He turned the docket round
and pushed it gently across the desk to Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">The red sans serif letters, still damp, said: <span class="calibre1">FOR YOUR
EYES ONLY</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said nothing. He nodded and picked up the
docket and walked out of the room.</p>

<hr class="tbk1"/>

<p class="pindent">Two days later, Bond took the Friday Comet to
Montreal. He did not care for it. It flew too high and
too fast and there were too many passengers. He regretted
the days of the old Stratocruiser—that fine
lumbering old plane that took ten hours to cross the
Atlantic. Then one had been able to have dinner in
peace, sleep for seven hours in a comfortable bunk, and
get up in time to wander down to the lower deck and
have that ridiculous B.O.A.C. ‘country house’ breakfast
while the dawn came up and flooded the cabin
with the first bright gold of the Western hemisphere.
Now it was all too quick. The stewards had to serve
everything almost at the double, and then one had a
bare two hours snooze before the hundred-mile-long
descent from forty thousand feet. Only eight hours
after leaving London, Bond was driving a Hertz U-drive
Plymouth saloon along the broad Route 17 from
Montreal to Ottawa and trying to remember to keep
on the right of the road.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Headquarters of the Royal Canadian Mounted
Police are in the Department of Justice alongside Parliament
Buildings in Ottawa. Like most Canadian
public buildings, the Department of Justice is a massive
block of grey masonry built to look stodgily important
and to withstand long and hard winters. Bond
had been told to ask at the front desk for the Commissioner
and to give his name as ‘Mr James’. He did
so, and a young fresh-faced R.C.M.P. corporal, who
looked as if he did not like being kept indoors on a
warm sunny day, took him up in the lift to the third
floor and handed him over to a sergeant in a large tidy
office which contained two girl secretaries and a lot of
heavy furniture. The sergeant spoke on an intercom
and there was a ten minutes delay during which Bond
smoked and read a recruiting pamphlet which made
the Mounties sound like a mixture between a dude
ranch, Dick Tracy and <span class="it">Rose Marie</span>. When he was shown
in through the connecting door a tall youngish man in
a dark blue suit, white shirt and black tie turned away
from the window and came towards him. ‘Mr James?’
the man smiled thinly. ‘I’m Colonel, let’s say—er—Johns.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They shook hands. ‘Come along and sit down. The
Commissioner’s very sorry not to be here to welcome
you himself. He has a bad cold—you know, one of
those diplomatic ones.’ Colonel ‘Johns’ looked amused.
‘Thought it might be best to take the day off. I’m just
one of the help. I’ve been on one or two hunting-trips
myself and the Commissioner fixed on me to handle
this little holiday of yours,’ the Colonel paused, ‘on me
only. Right?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled. The Commissioner was glad to help
but he was going to handle this with kid gloves. There
would be no come-back on his office. Bond thought he
must be a careful and very sensible man. He said: ‘I
quite understand. My friends in London didn’t want
the Commissioner to bother himself personally with
any of this. And I haven’t seen the Commissioner or
been anywhere near his headquarters. That being so,
can we talk English for ten minutes or so—just between
the two of us?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colonel Johns laughed. ‘Sure. I was told to make
that little speech and then get down to business. You
understand, Commander, that you and I are about to
connive at various felonies, starting with obtaining a
Canadian hunting-licence under false pretences and
being an accessory to a breach of the frontier laws, and
going on down from there to more serious things. It
wouldn’t do anyone one bit of good to have any ricochets
from this little lot. Get me?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s how my friends feel too. When I go out of
here, we’ll forget each other, and if I end up in Sing-Sing
that’s my worry. Well, now?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colonel Johns opened a drawer in the desk and took
out a bulging file and opened it. The top document
was a list. He put his pencil on the first item and looked
across at Bond. He ran his eye over Bond’s old black
and white hound’s-tooth tweed suit and white shirt and
thin black tie. He said: ‘Clothes.’ He unclipped a plain
sheet of paper from the file and slid it across the desk.
‘This is a list of what I reckon you’ll need and the address
of a big second-hand clothing store here in the
city. Nothing fancy, nothing conspicuous—khaki
shirt, dark brown jeans, good climbing-boots or shoes.
See they’re comfortable. And there’s the address of a
chemist for walnut stain. Buy a gallon and give yourself
a bath in the stuff. There are plenty of browns in
the hills at this time and you won’t want to be wearing
parachute cloth or anything that smells of camouflage.
Right? If you’re picked up, you’re an Englishman on
a hunting-trip in Canada who’s lost his way and got
across the border by mistake. Rifle. Went down myself
and put it in the boot of your Plymouth while you
were waiting. One of the new Savage 99Fs, Weatherby
6 x 62 ‘scope, five-shot repeater with twenty rounds of
high-velocity ·250-3,000. Lightest big-game lever action
on the market. Only six and a half pounds. Belongs
to a friend. Glad to have it back one day, but he won’t
miss it if it doesn’t turn up. It’s been tested and it’s
okay up to five hundred. Gun licence,’ Colonel Johns
slid it over, ‘issued here in the city in your real name
as that fits with your passport. Hunting-licence ditto,
but small game only, vermin, as it isn’t quite the deer
season yet, also driving-licence to replace the provisional
one I had waiting for you with the Hertz
people. Haversack, compass—used ones, in the boot
of your car. Oh, by the way,’ Colonel Johns looked up
from his list, ‘you carrying a personal gun?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes. Walther PPK in a Berns-Martin holster.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Right, give me the number. I’ve got a blank licence
here. If that gets back to me it’s quite okay. I’ve got a
story for it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took out his gun and read off the number.
Colonel Johns filled in the form and pushed it over.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now then, maps. Here’s a local Esso map that’s all
you need to get you to the area.’ Colonel Johns got up
and walked round with the map to Bond and spread it
out. ‘You take this route 17 back to Montreal, get on
to 37 over the bridge at St Anne’s and then over the
river again on to 7. Follow 7 on down to Pike River.
Get on 52 to Stanbridge. Turn right in Stanbridge for
Frelighsburg and leave the car in a garage there. Good
roads all the way. Whole trip shouldn’t take you more
than five hours including stops. Okay? Now this is
where you’ve got to get things right. Make it that you
get to Frelighsburg around three a.m. Garage-hand’ll
be half asleep and you’ll be able to get the gear out of
the boot and move off without him noticing even if
you were a double-headed Chinaman.’ Colonel Johns
went back to his chair and took two more pieces of
paper off the file. The first was a scrap of pencilled
map, the other a section of aerial photograph. He said,
looking seriously at Bond: ‘Now, here are the only inflammable
things you’ll be carrying and I’ve got to
rely on you getting rid of them just as soon as they’ve
been used, or at once if there’s a chance of you getting
into trouble. This,’ he pushed the paper over, ‘is a
rough sketch of an old smuggling-route from Prohibition
days. It’s not used now or I wouldn’t recommend
it.’ Colonel Johns smiled sourly. ‘You might find some
rough customers coming over in the opposite direction,
and they’re apt to shoot and not even ask questions
afterwards—crooks, druggers, white-slavers—but
nowadays they mostly travel up by Viscount. This
route was used for runners between Franklin, just over
the Derby Line, and Frelighsburg. You follow this
path through the foothills, and you detour Franklin
and get into the start of the Green Mountains. There
it’s all Vermont spruce and pine with a bit of maple,
and you can stay inside that stuff for months and not
see a soul. You get across country here, over a couple
of highways, and you leave Enosburg Falls to the
West. Then you’re over a steep range and down into
the top of the valley you want. The cross is Echo Lake
and, judging from the photographs, I’d be inclined to
come down on top of it from the east. Got it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What’s the distance? About ten miles?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ten and a half. Take you about three hours from
Frelighsburg if you don’t lose your way, so you’ll be in
sight of the place around six and have about an hour’s
light to help you over the last stretch.’ Colonel Johns
pushed over the square of aerial photograph. It was a
central cut from the one Bond had seen in London. It
showed a long low range of well-kept buildings made
of cut stone. The roofs were of slate, and there was a
glimpse of graceful bow windows and a covered patio.
A dust road ran past the front door and on this side
were garages and what appeared to be kennels. On the
garden side was a stone flagged terrace with a flowered
border, and beyond this two or three acres of trim
lawn stretched down to the edge of the small lake. The
lake appeared to have been artificially created with
a deep stone dam. There was a group of wrought-iron
garden furniture where the dam wall left the bank
and, half-way along the wall, a diving-board and a
ladder to climb out of the lake. Beyond the lake the
forest rose steeply up. It was from this side that
Colonel Johns suggested an approach. There were no
people in the photograph, but on the stone flags in
front of the patio was a quantity of expensive-looking
aluminium garden furniture and a central glass table
with drinks. Bond remembered that the larger photograph
had shown a tennis court in the garden and on
the other side of the road the trim white fences and
grazing horses of a stud farm. Echo Lake looked what
it was—the luxurious retreat, in deep country, well
away from atom bomb targets, of a millionaire who
liked privacy and could probably offset a lot of his
running expenses against the stud farm and an occasional
good let. It would be an admirable refuge for a
man who had had ten steamy years of Caribbean
politics and who needed a rest to recharge his batteries.
The lake was also convenient for washing blood off
hands.</p>

<p class="pindent">Colonel Johns closed his now empty file and tore the
typewritten list into small fragments and dropped
them in the wastepaper basket. The two men got to
their feet. Colonel Johns took Bond to the door and
held out his hand. He said: ‘Well, I guess that’s all.
I’d give a lot to come with you. Talking about all this
has reminded me of one or two sniping jobs at the end
of the War. I was in the Army then. We were under
Monty in Eighth Corps. On the left of the line in the
Ardennes. It was much the same sort of country as
you’ll be using, only different trees. But you know how
it is in these police jobs. Plenty of paper-work and keep
your nose clean for the pension. Well, so long and the
best of luck. No doubt I’ll read all about it in the
papers,’ he smiled, ‘whichever way it goes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond thanked him and shook him by the hand. A
last question occurred to him. He said: ‘By the way, is
the Savage single pull or double? I won’t have a
chance of finding out and there may not be much time
for experimenting when the target shows.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Single pull and it’s a hair-trigger. Keep your finger
off until you’re sure you’ve got him. And keep outside
three hundred if you can. I guess these men are pretty
good themselves. Don’t get too close.’ He reached for
the door-handle. His other hand went to Bond’s
shoulder. ‘Our Commissioner’s got a motto: “Never
send a man where you can send a bullet.” You might
remember that. So long, Commander.’</p>

<hr class="tbk1"/>

<p class="pindent">Bond spent the night and most of the next day at the
<span class="calibre1">KO-ZEE</span> Motor Court outside Montreal. He paid in
advance for three nights. He passed the day looking to
his equipment and wearing in the soft ripple rubber
climbing-boots he had bought in Ottawa. He bought
glucose tablets and some smoked ham and bread from
which he made himself sandwiches. He also bought a
large aluminium flask and filled this with three-quarters
Bourbon and a quarter coffee. When darkness
came he had dinner and a short sleep and then
diluted the walnut stain and washed himself all over
with the stuff even to the roots of his hair. He came out
looking like a Red Indian with blue-grey eyes. Just
before midnight he quietly opened the side door into
the automobile bay, got into the Plymouth and drove
off on the last lap south to Frelighsburg.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man at the all-night garage was not as sleepy as
Colonel Johns had said he would be.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Goin’ huntin’, mister?’</p>

<p class="pindent">You can get far in North America with laconic
grunts. Huh, hun and hi! in their various modulations,
together with sure, guess so, that so? and nuts!
will meet almost any contingency.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond, slinging the strap of his rifle over his shoulder,
said ‘Hun.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Man got a fine beaver over by Highgate Springs
Saturday.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said indifferently ‘That so?’, paid for two
nights and walked out of the garage. He had stopped
on the far side of the town, and now he only had to
follow the highway for a hundred yards before he
found the dirt track running off into the woods on his
right. After half an hour the track petered out at a
broken-down farmhouse. A chained dog set up a
frenzied barking, but no light showed in the farmhouse
and Bond skirted it and at once found the path
by the stream. He was to follow this for three miles.
He lengthened his stride to get away from the dog.
When the barking stopped there was silence, the deep
velvet silence of woods on a still night. It was a warm
night with a full yellow moon that threw enough light
down through the thick spruce for Bond to follow the
path without difficulty. The springy, cushioned soles
of the climbing-boots were wonderful to walk on, and
Bond got his second wind and knew he was making
good time. At around four o’clock the trees began to
thin and he was soon walking through open fields with
the scattered lights of Franklin on his right. He crossed
a secondary, tarred road, and now there was a wider
track through more woods and on his right the pale
glitter of a lake. By five o’clock he had crossed the
black rivers of U.S. highways 108 and 120. On the
latter was a sign saying <span class="calibre1">ENOSBURG FALLS 1 MI</span>. Now he
was on the last lap—a small hunting-trail that climbed
steeply. Well away from the highway, he stopped and
shifted his rifle and knapsack round, had a cigarette
and burned the sketch-map. Already there was a faint
paling in the sky and small noises in the forest—the
harsh, melancholy cry of a bird he did not know and
the rustlings of small animals. Bond visualized the
house deep down in the little valley on the other side
of the mountain ahead of him. He saw the blank curtained
windows, the crumpled sleeping faces of the
four men, the dew on the lawn and the widening rings
of the early rise on the gunmetal surface of the lake.
And here, on the other side of the mountain, was the
executioner coming up through the trees. Bond closed
his mind to the picture, trod the remains of his
cigarette into the ground and got going.</p>

<p class="pindent">Was this a hill or a mountain? At what height does
a hill become a mountain? Why don’t they manufacture
something out of the silver bark of birch trees?
It looks so useful and valuable. The best things in
America are chipmunks, and oyster stew. In the
evening darkness doesn’t really fall, it rises. When you
sit on top of a mountain and watch the sun go down
behind the mountain opposite, the darkness rises up to
you out of the valley. Will the birds one day lose their
fear of man? It must be centuries since man has killed
a small bird for food in these woods, yet they are still
afraid. Who was this Ethan Allen who commanded the
Green Mountain Boys of Vermont? Now, in American
motels, they advertise Ethan Allen furniture as an
attraction. Why? Did he make furniture? Army boots
should have rubber soles like these.</p>

<p class="pindent">With these and other random thoughts Bond steadily
climbed upwards and obstinately pushed away from
him the thought of the four faces asleep on the white
pillows.</p>

<p class="pindent">The round peak was below the tree-line and Bond
could see nothing of the valley below. He rested and
then chose an oak tree, and climbed up and out along
a thick bough. Now he could see everything—the
endless vista of the Green Mountains stretching in
every direction as far as he could see, away to the east
the golden ball of the sun just coming up in glory, and
below, two thousand feet down a long easy slope of
tree-tops broken once by a wide band of meadow,
through a thin veil of mist, the lake, the lawns and the
house.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond lay along the branch and watched the band of
pale early morning sunshine creeping down into the
valley. It took a quarter of an hour to reach the lake,
and then seemed to flood at once over the glittering
lawn and over the wet slate tiles of the roofs. Then the
mist went quickly from the lake and the target area,
washed and bright and new, lay waiting like an empty
stage.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond slipped the telescopic sight out of his pocket
and went over the scene inch by inch. Then he examined
the sloping ground below him and estimated
ranges. From the edge of the meadow, which would be
his only open field of fire unless he went down through
the last belt of trees to the edge of the lake, it would be
about five hundred yards to the terrace and the patio,
and about three hundred to the diving-board and the
edge of the lake. What did these people do with their
time? What was their routine? Did they ever bathe?
It was still warm enough. Well, there was all day. If
by the end of it they had not come down to the lake, he
would just have to take his chance at the patio and
five hundred yards. But it would not be a good chance
with a strange rifle. Ought he to get on down straight
away to the edge of the meadow? It was a wide
meadow, perhaps five hundred yards of going without
cover. It would be as well to get that behind him before
the house awoke. What time did these people get up
in the morning?</p>

<p class="pindent">As if to answer him, a white blind rolled up in one
of the smaller windows to the left of the main block.
Bond could distinctly hear the final snap of the spring
roller. Echo Lake! Of course. Did the echo work both
ways? Would he have to be careful of breaking
branches and twigs? Probably not. The sounds in the
valley would bounce upwards off the surface of the
water. But there must be no chances taken.</p>

<p class="pindent">A thin column of smoke began to trickle up straight
into the air from one of the left-hand chimneys. Bond
thought of the bacon and eggs that would soon be
frying. And the hot coffee. He eased himself back along
the branch and down to the ground. He would have
something to eat, smoke his last safe cigarette and get
on down to the firing-point.</p>

<p class="pindent">The bread stuck in Bond’s throat. Tension was
building up in him. In his imagination he could already
hear the deep bark of the Savage. He could see
the black bullet lazily, like a slow flying bee, homing
down into the valley towards a square of pink skin.
There was a light smack as it hit. The skin dented,
broke and then closed up again leaving a small hole
with bruised edges. The bullet ploughed on, unhurriedly,
towards the pulsing heart—the tissues, the
blood-vessels, parting obediently to let it through.
Who was this man he was going to do this to? What
had he ever done to Bond? Bond looked thoughtfully
down at his trigger-finger. He crooked it slowly, feeling
in his imagination the cool curve of metal. Almost
automatically, his left hand reached out for the flask.
He held it to his lips and tilted his head back. The
coffee and whisky burned a small fire down his throat.
He put the top back on the flask and waited for the
warmth of the whisky to reach his stomach. Then he
got slowly to his feet, stretched and yawned deeply and
picked up the rifle and slung it over his shoulder. He
looked round carefully to mark the place when he
came back up the hill and started slowly off down
through the trees.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now there was no trail and he had to pick his way
slowly, watching the ground for dead branches. The
trees were more mixed. Among the spruce and silver
birch there was an occasional oak and beech and sycamore
and, here and there, the blazing Bengal fire of a
maple in autumn dress. Under the trees was a sparse
undergrowth of their saplings and much dead wood
from old hurricanes. Bond went carefully down, his
feet making little sound among the leaves and moss-covered
rocks, but soon the forest was aware of him
and began to pass on the news. A large doe, with two
Bambi-like young, saw him first and galloped off with
an appalling clatter. A brilliant woodpecker with a
scarlet head flew down ahead of him, screeching each
time Bond caught up with it, and always there were the
chipmunks, craning up on their hind feet, lifting their
small muzzles from their teeth as they tried to catch
his scent, and then scampering off to their rock holes
with chatterings that seemed to fill the woods with
fright. Bond willed them to have no fear, that the gun
he carried was not meant for them, but with each
alarm he wondered if, when he got to the edge of the
meadow, he would see down on the lawn a man with
glasses who had been watching the frightened birds
fleeing the tree-tops.</p>

<p class="pindent">But when he stopped behind a last broad oak and
looked down across the long meadow to the final belt
of trees and the lake and the house, nothing had
changed. All the other blinds were still down and the
only movement was the thin plume of smoke.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was eight o’clock. Bond gazed down across the
meadow to the trees, looking for one which would suit
his purpose. He found it—a big maple, blazing with
russet and crimson. This would be right for his
clothes, its trunk was thick enough and it stood slightly
back from the wall of spruce. From there, standing, he
would be able to see all he needed of the lake and the
house. Bond stood for a while, plotting his route down
through the thick grass and golden-rod of the meadow.
He would have to do it on his stomach, and slowly. A
small breeze got up and combed the meadow. If only
it would keep blowing and cover his passage!</p>

<p class="pindent">Somewhere not far off, up to the left on the edge of
the trees, a branch snapped. It snapped once decisively
and there was no further noise. Bond dropped to one
knee, his ears pricked and his senses questing. He
stayed like that for a full ten minutes, a motionless
brown shadow against the wide trunk of the oak.</p>

<p class="pindent">Animals and birds do not break twigs. Dead wood
must carry a special danger signal for them. Birds never
alight on twigs that will break under them, and even a
large animal like a deer with antlers and four hooves
to manipulate moves quite silently in a forest unless he
is in flight. Had these people after all got guards out?
Gently Bond eased the rifle off his shoulder and put his
thumb on the safe. Perhaps, if the people were still
sleeping, a single shot, from high up in the woods,
would pass for a hunter or a poacher. But then, between
him and approximately where the twig had
snapped, two deer broke cover and cantered unhurriedly
across the meadow to the left. It was true
that they stopped twice to look back, but each time
they cropped a few mouthfuls of grass before moving
on and into the distant fringe of the lower woods. They
showed no fright and no haste. It was certainly they
who had been the cause of the snapped branch. Bond
breathed a sigh. So much for that. And now to get on
across the meadow.</p>

<p class="pindent">A five-hundred-yard crawl through tall concealing
grass is a long and wearisome business. It is hard on
knees and hands and elbows, there is a vista of nothing
but grass and flower-stalks, and the dust and small insects
get into your eyes and nose and down your neck.
Bond focused on placing his hands right and maintaining
a slow, even speed. The breeze had kept up and
his wake through the grass would certainly not be
noticeable from the house.</p>

<p class="pindent">From above, it looked as if a big ground animal—a
beaver perhaps, or a woodchuck—was on its way
down the meadow. No, it would not be a beaver. They
always move in pairs. And yet perhaps it might be a
beaver—for now, from higher up on the meadow,
something, somebody else had entered the tall grass,
and behind and above Bond a second wake was being
cut in the deep sea of grass. It looked as if whatever it
was would slowly catch up on Bond and that the two
wakes would converge just at the next tree-line.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond crawled and slithered steadily on, stopping
only to wipe the sweat and dust off his face and, from
time to time, to make sure that he was on-course for
the maple. But when he was close enough for the tree-line
to hide him from the house, perhaps twenty feet
from the maple, he stopped and lay for a while,
massaging his knees and loosening his wrists for the last
lap.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had heard nothing to warn him, and when the
soft threatening whisper came from only feet away in
the thick grass on his left, his head swivelled so sharply
that the vertebrae of his neck made a cracking sound.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Move an inch and I’ll kill you.’ It had been a girl’s
voice, but a voice that fiercely meant what it said.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond, his heart thumping, stared up the shaft of the
steel arrow whose blue-tempered triangular tip parted
the grass stalks perhaps eighteen inches from his head.</p>

<p class="pindent">The bow was held sideways, flat in the grass. The
knuckles of the brown fingers that held the binding of
the bow below the arrow-tip were white. Then there
was the length of glinting steel and, behind the metal
feathers, partly obscured by waving strands of grass,
were grimly clamped lips below two fierce grey eyes
against a background of sunburned skin damp with
sweat. That was all Bond could make out through the
grass. Who the hell was this? One of the guards? Bond
gathered saliva back into his dry mouth and began
slowly to edge his right hand, his out-of-sight hand,
round and up towards his waistband and his gun. He
said softly: ‘Who the hell are you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The arrow-tip gestured threateningly. ‘Stop that
right hand or I’ll put this through your shoulder. Are
you one of the guards?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No. Are you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t be a fool. What are you doing here?’ The
tension in the voice had slackened, but it was still hard,
suspicious. There was a trace of accent—what was it,
Scots? Welsh?</p>

<p class="pindent">It was time to get to level terms. There was something
particularly deadly about the blue arrow-tip.
Bond said easily: ‘Put away your bow and arrow,
Robina. Then I’ll tell you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You swear not to go for your gun?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right. But for God’s sake let’s get out of the
middle of this field.’ Without waiting, Bond rose on
hands and knees and started to crawl again. Now he
must get the initiative and hold it. Whoever this
damned girl was, she would have to be disposed of
quickly and discreetly before the shooting-match began.
God, as if there wasn’t enough to think of already!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond reached the trunk of the tree. He got carefully
to his feet and took a quick look through the blazing
leaves. Most of the blinds had gone up. Two slow-moving
coloured maids were laying a large breakfast
table on the patio. He had been right. The field of
vision over the tops of the trees that now fell sharply to
the lake was perfect. Bond unslung his rifle and knapsack
and sat down with his back against the trunk of
the tree. The girl came out of the edge of the grass and
stood up under the maple. She kept her distance. The
arrow was still held in the bow but the bow was unpulled.
They looked warily at each other.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl looked like a beautiful unkempt dryad in
ragged shirt and trousers. The shirt and trousers were
olive green, crumpled and splashed with mud and
stains and torn in places, and she had bound her pale
blonde hair with golden-rod to conceal its brightness
for her crawl through the meadow. The beauty of her
face was wild and rather animal, with a wide sensuous
mouth, high cheek-bones and silvery grey, disdainful
eyes. There was the blood of scratches on her forearms
and down one cheek, and a bruise had puffed and
slightly blackened the same cheek-bone. The metal
feathers of a quiver full of arrows showed above her
left shoulder. Apart from the bow, she carried nothing
but a hunting-knife at her belt and, at her other hip,
a small brown canvas bag that presumably carried her
food. She looked like a beautiful, dangerous customer
who knew wild country and forests and was not afraid
of them. She would walk alone through life and have
little use for civilization.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond thought she was wonderful. He smiled at her.
He said softly, reassuringly: ‘I suppose you’re Robina
Hood. My name’s James Bond.’ He reached for his
flask and unscrewed the top and held it out. ‘Sit down
and have a drink of this—firewater and coffee. And
I’ve got some biltong. Or do you live on dew and
berries?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She came a little closer and sat down a yard from
him. She sat like a Red Indian, her knees splayed wide
and her ankles tucked up high under her thighs. She
reached for the flask and drank deeply with her head
thrown back. She handed it back without comment.
She did not smile. She said ‘Thanks’ grudgingly, and
took her arrow and thrust it over her back to join the
others in the quiver. She said, watching him closely:
‘I suppose you’re a poacher. The deer-hunting season
doesn’t open for another three weeks. But you won’t
find any deer down here. They only come so low at
night. You ought to be higher up during the day, much
higher. If you like, I’ll tell you where there are some.
Quite a big herd. It’s a bit late in the day, but you
could still get to them. They’re up-wind from here
and you seem to know about stalking. You don’t make
much noise.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Is that what you’re doing here—hunting? Let’s see
your licence.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Her shirt had buttoned-down breast pockets. Without
protest she took out from one of them the white
paper and handed it over.</p>

<p class="pindent">The licence had been issued in Bennington, Vermont.
It had been issued in the name of Judy Havelock.
There was a list of types of permit. ‘Non-resident
hunting’ and ‘Non-resident bow and arrow’ had been
ticked. The cost had been $18.50, payable to the Fish
and Game Service, Montpelier, Vermont. Judy Havelock
had given her age as twenty-five and her place of
birth as Jamaica.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond thought: ‘God Almighty!’ He handed the paper
back. So that was the score! He said with sympathy
and respect: ‘You’re quite a girl, Judy. It’s a long walk
from Jamaica. And you were going to take him on
with your bow and arrow. You know what they say in
China: “Before you set out on revenge, dig two
graves.” Have you done that, or did you expect to get
away with it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl was staring at him. ‘Who are you? What
are you doing here? What do you know about it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond reflected. There was only one way out of this
mess and that was to join forces with the girl. What a
hell of a business! He said resignedly: ‘I’ve told you
my name. I’ve been sent out from London by, er,
Scotland Yard, I know all about your troubles and
I’ve come out here to pay off some of the score and see
you’re not bothered by these people. In London we
think that the man in that house might start putting
pressure on you, about your property, and there’s no
other way of stopping him.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl said bitterly: ‘I had a favourite pony, a
Palomino. Three weeks ago they poisoned it. Then
they shot my Alsatian. I’d raised it from a puppy.
Then came a letter. It said, “Death has many hands.
One of these hands is now raised over you.” I was to
put a notice in the paper, in the personal column, on a
particular day. I was just to say, “I will obey. Judy.”
I went to the police. All they did was to offer me protection.
It was people in Cuba, they thought. There
was nothing else they could do about it. So I went to
Cuba and stayed in the best hotel and gambled big in
the casinos.’ She gave a little smile. ‘I wasn’t dressed
like this. I wore my best dresses and the family jewels.
And people made up to me. I was nice to them. I had
to be. And all the while I asked questions. I pretended
I was out for thrills—that I wanted to see the underworld
and some real gangsters, and so on. And in the
end I found out about this man.’ She gestured down
towards the house. ‘He had left Cuba. Batista had
found out about him or something. And he had a
lot of enemies. I was told plenty about him and in
the end I met a man, a sort of high-up policeman,
who told me the rest after I had,’ she hesitated and
avoided Bond’s eyes, ‘after I had made up to him.’
She paused. She went on: ‘I left and went to America.
I had read somewhere about Pinkerton’s, the detective
people. I went to them and paid to have them find this
man’s address.’ She turned her hands palm upwards
on her lap. Now her eyes were defiant. ‘That’s all.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How did you get here?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I flew up to Bennington. Then I walked. Four days.
Up through the Green Mountains. I kept out of the
way of people. I’m used to this sort of thing. Our
house is in the mountains in Jamaica. They’re much
more difficult than these. And there are more people,
peasants, about in them. Here no one ever seems to
walk. They go by car.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And what were you going to do then?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m going to shoot von Hammerstein and walk back
to Bennington.’ The voice was as casual as if she had
said she was going to pick a wild flower.</p>

<p class="pindent">From down in the valley came the sound of voices.
Bond got to his feet and took a quick look through the
branches. Three men and two girls had come on to the
patio. There was talk and laughter as they pulled out
chairs and sat down at the table. One place was left
empty at the head of the table between the two girls.
Bond took out his telescopic sight and looked through
it. The three men were very small and dark. One of
them, who smiled all the time and whose clothes
looked the cleanest and smartest, would be Gonzales.
The other two were low peasant types. They sat together
at the foot of the oblong table and took no part
in the talk. The girls were swarthy brunettes. They
looked like cheap Cuban whores. They wore bright
bathing-dresses and a lot of gold jewellery, and
laughed and chattered like pretty monkeys. The
voices were almost clear enough to understand, but
they were talking Spanish.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond felt the girl near him. She stood a yard behind
him. Bond handed her the glass. He said: ‘The neat
little man is called Major Gonzales. The two at the
bottom of the table are gunmen. I don’t know who the
girls are. Von Hammerstein isn’t there yet.’ She took
a quick look through the glass and handed it back
without comment. Bond wondered if she realized that
she had been looking at the murderers of her father and
mother.</p>

<p class="pindent">The two girls had turned and were looking towards
the door into the house. One of them called out something
that might have been a greeting. A short, square,
almost naked man came out into the sunshine. He
walked silently past the table to the edge of the flagged
terrace facing the lawn and proceeded to go through a
five-minute programme of physical drill.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond examined the man minutely. He was about
five feet four with a boxer’s shoulders and hips, but a
stomach that was going to fat. A mat of black hair
covered his breasts and shoulder-blades, and his arms
and legs were thick with it. By contrast, there was not
a hair on his face or head and his skull was a glittering
whitish yellow with a deep dent at the back that might
have been a wound or the scar of a trepanning. The
bone-structure of the face was that of the conventional
Prussian officer—square, hard and thrusting—but
the eyes under the naked brows were close-set and
piggish, and the large mouth had hideous lips—thick
and wet and crimson. He wore nothing but a strip of
black material, hardly larger than an athletic support-belt,
round his stomach, and a large gold wrist-watch
on a gold bracelet. Bond handed the glass to the girl.
He was relieved. Von Hammerstein looked just about
as unpleasant as M’s dossier said he was.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond watched the girl’s face. The mouth looked
grim, almost cruel, as she looked down on the man she
had come to kill. What was he to do about her? He
could see nothing but a vista of troubles from her presence.
She might even interfere with his own plans and
insist on playing some silly role with her bow and
arrow. Bond made up his mind. He just could not
afford to take chances. One short tap at the base of the
skull and he would gag her and tie her up until it was
all over. Bond reached softly for the butt of his automatic.</p>

<p class="pindent">Nonchalantly the girl moved a few steps back. Just
as nonchalantly she bent down, put the glass on the
ground and picked up her bow. She reached behind
her for an arrow, and fitted it casually into the bow.
Then she looked up at Bond and said quietly: ‘Don’t
get any silly ideas. And keep your distance. I’ve got
what’s called wide-angled vision. I haven’t come all
the way here to be knocked on the head by a flat-footed
London bobby. I can’t miss with this at fifty
yards, and I’ve killed birds on the wing at a hundred.
I don’t want to put an arrow through your leg, but I
shall if you interfere.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond cursed his previous indecision. He said fiercely:
‘Don’t be a silly bitch. Put that damned thing down.
This is man’s work. How in hell do you think you can
take on four men with a bow and arrow?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl’s eyes blazed obstinately. She moved her
right foot back into the shooting-stance. She said
through compressed, angry lips: ‘You go to hell. And
keep out of this. It was my mother and father they
killed. Not yours. I’ve already been here a day and a
night. I know what they do and I know how to get
Hammerstein. I don’t care about the others. They’re
nothing without him. Now then.’ She pulled the bow
half taut. The arrow pointed at Bond’s feet. ‘Either
you do what I say or you’re going to be sorry. And
don’t think I don’t mean it. This is a private thing I’ve
sworn to do and nobody’s going to stop me.’ She tossed
her head imperiously. ‘Well?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gloomily measured the situation. He looked
the ridiculously beautiful wild girl up and down. This
was good hard English stock spiced with the hot
peppers of a tropical childhood. Dangerous mixture.
She had keyed herself up to a state of controlled hysteria.
He was quite certain that she would think
nothing of putting him out of action. And he had absolutely
no defence. Her weapon was silent, his would
alert the whole neighbourhood. Now the only hope
would be to work with her. Give her part of the job
and he would do the rest. He said quietly: ‘Now listen,
Judy. If you insist on coming in on this thing we’d
better do it together. Then perhaps we can bring it off
and stay alive. This sort of thing is my profession. I
was ordered to do it—by a close friend of your family,
if you want to know. And I’ve got the right weapon.
It’s got at least five times the range of yours. I could
take a good chance of killing him now, on the patio.
But the odds aren’t quite good enough. Some of them
have got bathing-things on. They’ll be coming down
to the lake. Then I’m going to do it. You can give
supporting fire.’ He ended lamely: ‘It’ll be a great
help.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No.’ She shook her head decisively. ‘I’m sorry. You
can give what you call supporting fire if you like. I
don’t care one way or the other. You’re right about
the swimming. Yesterday they were all down at the
lake around eleven. It’s just as warm today and they’ll
be there again. I shall get him from the edge of the
trees by the lake. I found a perfect place last night.
The bodyguard men bring their guns with them—sort
of tommy-gun things. They don’t bathe. They sit
around and keep guard. I know the moment to get
von Hammerstein and I’ll be well away from the lake
before they take in what’s happened. I tell you I’ve
got it all planned. Now then. I can’t hang around any
more. I ought to have been in my place already. I’m
sorry, but unless you say yes straight away there’s no
alternative.’ She raised the bow a few inches.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond thought: Damn this girl to hell. He said
angrily: ‘All right then. But I can tell you that if we
get out of this you’re going to get such a spanking you
won’t be able to sit down for a week.’ He shrugged.
He said with resignation: ‘Go ahead. I’ll look after the
others. If you get away all right, meet me here. If you
don’t, I’ll come down and pick up the pieces.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl unstrung her bow. She said indifferently:
‘I’m glad you’re seeing sense. These arrows are difficult
to pull out. Don’t worry about me. But keep out
of sight and mind the sun doesn’t catch that glass of
yours.’ She gave Bond the brief, pitying, self-congratulatory
smile of the woman who has had the last
word, and turned and made off down through the
trees.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond watched the lithe dark green figure until it
had vanished among the tree-trunks, then he impatiently
picked up the glass and went back to his
vantage-point. To hell with her! It was time to clear
the silly bitch out of his mind and concentrate on the
job. Was there anything else he could have done—any
other way of handling it? Now he was committed
to wait for her to fire the first shot. That was bad. But
if he fired first there was no knowing what the hot-headed
bitch would do. Bond’s mind luxuriated briefly
in the thought of what he would do to the girl once all
this was over. Then there was movement in front of
the house, and he put the exciting thoughts aside and
lifted his glass.</p>

<p class="pindent">The breakfast things were being cleared away by
the two maids. There was no sign of the girls or the
gunmen. Von Hammerstein was lying back among the
cushions of an outdoor couch reading a newspaper and
occasionally commenting to Major Gonzales, who sat
astride an iron garden chair near his feet. Gonzales
was smoking a cigar and from time to time he delicately
raised a hand in front of his mouth, leant sideways
and spat a bit of leaf out on the ground. Bond
could not hear what von Hammerstein was saying, but
his comments were in English and Gonzales answered
in English. Bond glanced at his watch. It was ten-thirty.
Since the scene seemed to be static, Bond sat
down with his back to the tree and went over the
Savage with minute care. At the same time he thought
of what would shortly have to be done with it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond did not like what he was going to do, and all
the way from England he had had to keep on reminding
himself what sort of men these were. The killing of
the Havelocks had been a particularly dreadful killing.
Von Hammerstein and his gunmen were particularly
dreadful men whom many people around the world
would probably be very glad to destroy, as this girl
proposed to do, out of private revenge. But for Bond it
was different. He had no personal motives against
them. This was merely his job—as it was the job of a
pest control officer to kill rats. He was the public executioner
appointed by M to represent the community.
In a way, Bond argued to himself, these men were as
much enemies of his country as were the agents of
SMERSH or of other enemy Secret Services. They had
declared and waged war against British people on
British soil and they were currently planning another
attack. Bond’s mind hunted round for more arguments
to bolster his resolve. They had killed the
girl’s pony and her dog with two casual sideswipes of
the hand as if they had been flies. They . . .</p>

<p class="pindent">A burst of automatic fire from the valley brought
Bond to his feet. His rifle was up and taking aim as the
second burst came. The harsh racket of noise was followed
by laughter and hand-clapping. The kingfisher,
a handful of tattered blue and grey feathers, thudded
to the lawn and lay fluttering. Von Hammerstein,
smoke still dribbling from the snout of his tommy-gun,
walked a few steps and put the heel of his naked foot
down and pivoted sharply. He took his heel away and
wiped it on the grass beside the heap of feathers. The
others stood round, laughing and applauding obsequiously.
Von Hammerstein’s red lips grinned with
pleasure. He said something which included the word
‘crackshot’. He handed the gun to one of the gunmen
and wiped his hands down his fat backsides. He gave a
sharp order to the two girls, who ran off into the house,
then, with the others following, he turned and ambled
down the sloping lawn towards the lake. Now the girls
came running back out of the house. Each one carried
an empty champagne bottle. Chattering and laughing
they skipped down after the men.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got himself ready. He clipped the telescopic
sight on to the barrel of the Savage and took his stance
against the trunk of the tree. He found a bump in the
wood as a rest for his left hand, put his sights at 300,
and took broad aim at the group of people by the lake.
Then, holding the rifle loosely, he leaned against the
trunk and watched the scene.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was going to be some kind of a shooting contest
between the two gunmen. They snapped fresh magazines
on to their guns and at Gonzales’s orders stationed
themselves on the flat stone wall of the dam
some twenty feet apart on either side of the diving-board.
They stood with their backs to the lake and
their guns at the ready.</p>

<p class="pindent">Von Hammerstein took up his place on the grass
verge, a champagne bottle swinging in each hand.
The girls stood behind him, their hands over their ears.
There was excited jabbering in Spanish, and laughter
in which the two gunmen did not join. Through the
telescopic sight their faces looked sharp with
concentration.</p>

<p class="pindent">Von Hammerstein barked an order and there was
silence. He swung both arms back and counted ‘Un
. . . Dos . . . Tres.’ With the ‘tres’ he hurled the champagne
bottles high into the air over the lake.</p>

<p class="pindent">The two men turned like marionettes, the guns
clamped to their hips. As they completed the turn they
fired. The thunder of the guns split the peaceful scene
and racketed up from the water. Birds fled away
from the trees screeching and some small branches
cut by the bullets pattered down into the lake. The
left-hand bottle disintegrated into dust, the right-hand
one, hit by only a single bullet, split in two a fraction
of a second later. The fragments of glass made small
splashes over the middle of the lake. The gunman on
the left had won. The smoke-clouds over the two of
them joined and drifted away over the lawn. The
echoes boomed softly into silence. The two gunmen
walked along the wall to the grass, the rear one
looking sullen, the leading one with a sly grin on his
face. Von Hammerstein beckoned the two girls forward.
They came reluctantly, dragging their feet and
pouting. Von Hammerstein said something, asked a
question of the winner. The man nodded at the girl
on the left. She looked sullenly back at him. Gonzales
and Hammerstein laughed. Hammerstein reached out
and patted the girl on the rump as if she had been a
cow. He said something in which Bond caught the
words ‘una noche’. The girl looked up at him and
nodded obediently. The group broke up. The prize
girl took a quick run and dived into the lake, perhaps
to get away from the man who had won her favours,
and the other girl followed her. They swam away
across the lake calling angrily to each other. Major
Gonzales took off his coat and laid it on the grass and
sat down on it. He was wearing a shoulder holster
which showed the butt of a medium-calibre automatic.
He watched von Hammerstein take off his
watch and walk along the dam wall to the diving-board.
The gunmen stood back from the lake and
also watched von Hammerstein and the two girls,
who were now out in the middle of the little lake and
were making for the far shore. The gunmen stood
with their guns cradled in their arms and occasionally
one of them would glance round the garden or towards
the house. Bond thought there was every reason
why von Hammerstein had managed to stay alive so
long. He was a man who took trouble to do so.</p>

<p class="pindent">Von Hammerstein had reached the diving-board.
He walked along to the end and stood looking down
at the water. Bond tensed himself and put up the safe.
His eyes were fierce slits. It would be any minute now.
His finger itched on the trigger-guard. What in hell
was the girl waiting for?</p>

<p class="pindent">Von Hammerstein had made up his mind. He
flexed his knees slightly. The arms came back.
Through the telescopic sight Bond could see the thick
hair over his shoulder-blades tremble in a breeze that
came to give a quick shiver to the surface of the lake.
Now his arms were coming forward and there was a
fraction of a second when his feet had left the board
and he was still almost upright. In that fraction of a
second there was a flash of silver against his back and
then von Hammerstein’s body hit the water in a neat
dive.</p>

<p class="pindent">Gonzales was on his feet, looking uncertainly at the
turbulence caused by the dive. His mouth was open,
waiting. He did not know if he had seen something or
not. The two gunmen were more certain. They had
their guns at the ready. They crouched, looking from
Gonzales to the trees behind the dam, waiting for an
order.</p>

<p class="pindent">Slowly the turbulence subsided and the ripples
spread across the lake. The dive had gone deep.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s mouth was dry. He licked his lips, searching
the lake with his glass. There was a pink shimmer deep
down. It wobbled slowly up. Von Hammerstein’s body
broke the surface. It lay head down, wallowing softly.
A foot or so of steel shaft stuck up from below the left
shoulder-blade and the sun winked on the aluminium
feathers.</p>

<p class="pindent">Major Gonzales yelled an order and the two tommy-guns
roared and flamed. Bond could hear the crash
of the bullets among the trees below him. The Savage
shuddered against his shoulder and the right-hand
man fell slowly forward on his face. Now the other
man was running for the lake, his gun still firing from
the hip in short bursts. Bond fired and missed and
fired again. The man’s legs buckled, but his momentum
still carried him forward. He crashed into the
water. The clenched finger went on firing the gun
aimlessly up towards the blue sky until the water
throttled the mechanism.</p>

<p class="pindent">The seconds wasted on the extra shot had given
Major Gonzales a chance. He had got behind the
body of the first gunman and now he opened up on
Bond with the tommy-gun. Whether he had seen
Bond or was only firing at the flashes from the Savage
he was doing well. Bullets zwipped into the maple and
slivers of wood spattered into Bond’s face. Bond fired
twice. The dead body of the gunman jerked. Too low!
Bond reloaded and took fresh aim. A snapped branch
fell across his rifle. He shook it free, but now Gonzales
was up and running forward to the group of garden
furniture. He hurled the iron table on its side and got
behind it as two snap shots from Bond kicked chunks
out of the lawn at his heels. With this solid cover his
shooting became more accurate, and burst after burst,
now from the right of the table and now from the left,
crashed into the maple tree while Bond’s single shots
clanged against the white iron or whined off across
the lawn. It was not easy to traverse the telescopic
sight quickly from one side of the table to the other and
Gonzales was cunning with his changes. Again and
again his bullets thudded into the trunk beside and
above Bond. Bond ducked and ran swiftly to the right.
He would fire, standing, from the open meadow and
catch Gonzales off-guard. But even as he ran, he saw
Gonzales dart from behind the iron table. He also had
decided to end the stalemate. He was running for the
dam to get across and into the woods and come up
after Bond. Bond stood and threw up his rifle. As he
did so, Gonzales also saw him. He went down on one
knee on the dam wall and sprayed a burst at Bond.
Bond stood icily, hearing the bullets. The crossed
hairs centred on Gonzales’s chest. Bond squeezed the
trigger. Gonzales rocked. He half got to his feet. He
raised his arms and, with his gun still pumping bullets
into the sky, dived clumsily face forward into the
water.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond watched to see if the face would rise. It did
not. Slowly he lowered his rifle and wiped the back
of his arm across his face.</p>

<p class="pindent">The echoes, the echoes of much death, rolled to and
fro across the valley. Away to the right, in the trees
beyond the lake, he caught a glimpse of the two girls
running up towards the house. Soon they, if the maids
had not already done so, would be on to the State
troopers. It was time to get moving.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked back through the meadow to the lone
maple. The girl was there. She stood up against the
trunk of the tree with her back to him. Her head was
cradled in her arms against the tree. Blood was running
down the right arm and dripping to the ground,
and there was a black stain high up on the sleeve of
the dark green shirt. The bow and quiver of arrows
lay at her feet. Her shoulders were shaking.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond came up behind her and put a protective arm
across her shoulders. He said softly: ‘Take it easy,
Judy. It’s all over now. How bad’s the arm?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She said in a muffled voice: ‘It’s nothing. Something
hit me. But that was awful. I didn’t—I didn’t
know it would be like that.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond pressed her arm reassuringly. ‘It had to be
done. They’d have got you otherwise. Those were pro
killers—the worst. But I told you this sort of thing
was man’s work. Now then, let’s have a look at your
arm. We’ve got to get going—over the border. The
troopers’ll be here before long.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She turned. The beautiful wild face was streaked
with sweat and tears. Now the grey eyes were soft and
obedient. She said: ‘It’s nice of you to be like that.
After the way I was. I was sort of—sort of wound up.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She held out her arm. Bond reached for the hunting-knife
at her belt and cut off her shirt-sleeve at the
shoulder. There was the bruised, bleeding gash of a
bullet wound across the muscle. Bond took out his
own khaki handkerchief, cut it into three lengths and
joined them together. He washed the wound clean
with the coffee and whisky, and then took a thick
slice of bread from his haversack and bound it over
the wound. He cut her shirt-sleeve into a sling and
reached behind her neck to tie the knot. Her mouth
was inches from his. The scent of her body had a warm
animal tang. Bond kissed her once softly on the lips
and once again, hard. He tied the knot. He looked
into the grey eyes close to his. They looked surprised
and happy. He kissed her again at each corner of the
mouth and the mouth slowly smiled. Bond stood away
from her and smiled back. He softly picked up her
right hand and slipped the wrist into the sling. She
said docilely: ‘Where are you taking me?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said: ‘I’m taking you to London. There’s this
old man who will want to see you. But first we’ve got
to get over into Canada, and I’ll talk to a friend in
Ottawa and get your passport straightened out. You’ll
have to get some clothes and things. It’ll take a few
days. We’ll be staying in a place called the KO-ZEE
Motel.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked at him. She was a different girl. She said
softly: ‘That’ll be nice. I’ve never stayed in a motel.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond bent down and picked up his rifle and knapsack
and slung them over one shoulder. Then he
hung her bow and quiver over the other, and turned
and started up through the meadow.</p>

<p class="pindent">She fell in behind and followed him, and as she
walked she pulled the tired bits of golden-rod out of
her hair and undid a ribbon and let the pale gold hair
fall down to her shoulders.</p>
