<p class="line19">———— * ————</p>

<p class="line2"><span class="sc">The</span> eyes behind the wide black rubber goggles were
cold as flint. In the howling speed-turmoil of a B.S.A.
M.20 doing seventy, they were the only quiet things in
the hurtling flesh and metal. Protected by the glass of
the goggles, they stared fixedly ahead from just above
the centre of the handle-bars, and their dark unwavering
focus was that of gun-muzzles. Below the goggles,
the wind had got into the face through the mouth and
had wrenched the lips back into a square grin that
showed big tombstone teeth and strips of whitish gum.
On both sides of the grin the cheeks had been blown
out by the wind into pouches that fluttered slightly. To
right and left of the hurtling face under the crash-helmet,
the black gauntlets, broken-wristed at the controls,
looked like the attacking paws of a big animal.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man was dressed in the uniform of a dispatch-rider
in the Royal Corps of Signals, and his machine,
painted olive green, was, with certain modifications to
the valves and the carburettor and the removal of
some of the silencer baffles to give more speed, identical
with a standard British Army machine. There was
nothing in the man or his equipment to suggest that he
was not what he appeared to be, except a fully loaded
Luger held by a clip to the top of the petrol tank.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was seven o’clock on a May morning and the dead
straight road through the forest glittered with the tiny
luminous mist of spring. On both sides of the road the
moss- and flower-carpeted depths between the great
oak trees held the theatrical enchantment of the royal
forests of Versailles and St Germain. The road was
D.98, a secondary road serving local traffic in the St
Germain area, and the motor-cyclist had just passed
beneath the Paris-Mantes autoroute already thundering
with commuter traffic for Paris. He was heading
north towards St Germain and there was no one else
in sight in either direction, except, perhaps half a mile
ahead, an almost identical figure—another Royal
Corps dispatch-rider. He was a younger, slimmer man
and he sat comfortably back on his machine, enjoying
the morning and keeping his speed to around forty.
He was well on time and it was a beautiful day. He
wondered whether to have his eggs fried or scrambled
when he got back to H.Q. around eight.</p>

<p class="pindent">Five hundred yards, four hundred, three, two, one.
The man coming up from behind slowed to fifty. He
put his right gauntlet up to his teeth and pulled it off.
He stuffed the gauntlet between the buttons of his
tunic and reached down and unclipped the gun.</p>

<p class="pindent">By now he must have been big in the driving-mirror
of the young man ahead, for suddenly the young man
jerked his head round, surprised to find another dispatch-rider
on his run at that time of the morning. He
expected that it would be an American or perhaps
French military police. It might be anyone from the
eight <span class="calibre1">NATO</span> nations that made up the staff of <span class="calibre1">SHAPE</span>, but
when he recognized the uniform of the Corps he was
astonished and delighted. Who the hell could it be?
He raised a cheerful right thumb in recognition and
cut his speed to thirty, waiting for the other man to
drift up alongside. With one eye on the road ahead
and the other on the approaching silhouette in the
mirror, he ran through the names of the British riders
in the Special Service Transportation Unit at Headquarters
Command. Albert, Sid, Wally—might
be Wally, same thick build. Good show! He’d be
able to pull his leg about that little frog bit in the
canteen—Louise, Elise, Lise—what the hell was her
name.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man with the gun had slowed. Now he was fifty
yards away. His face, undistorted by the wind, had set
into blunt, hard, perhaps Slav lines. A red spark
burned behind the black, aimed muzzles of the eyes.
Forty yards, thirty. A single magpie flew out of the
forest ahead of the young dispatch-rider. It fled clumsily
across the road into the bushes behind a Michelin
sign that said that St Germain was one kilometre
to go. The young man grinned and raised an ironical
finger in salute and self-protection—‘One magpie is
sorrow.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Twenty yards behind him the man with the gun
took both hands off the handle-bars, lifted the
Luger, rested it carefully on his left forearm and fired
one shot.</p>

<p class="pindent">The young man’s hands whipped off his controls
and met across the centre of his backward-arching
spine. His machine veered across the road, jumped a
narrow ditch and ploughed into a patch of grass and
lilies of the valley. There it rose up on its screaming
back wheel and slowly crashed backwards on top of
its dead rider. The B.S.A. coughed and kicked and
tore at the young man’s clothes and at the flowers, and
then lay quiet.</p>

<p class="pindent">The killer executed a narrow turn and stopped with
his machine pointing back the way he had come. He
stamped down the wheel-rest, pulled his machine up
on to it and walked in among the wild flowers under
the trees. He knelt down beside the dead man and
brusquely pulled back an eyelid. Just as roughly he
tore the black leather dispatch-case off the corpse and
ripped open the buttons of the tunic and removed a
battered leather wallet. He wrenched a cheap wrist-watch
so sharply off the left wrist that the chrome expanding
bracelet snapped in half. He stood up and
slung the dispatch-case over his shoulder. While he
stowed the wallet and the watch away in his tunic
pocket he listened. There were only forest sounds
and the slow tick of hot metal from the crashed B.S.A.
The killer retraced his steps to the road. He walked
slowly, scuffing leaves over the tyre marks in the soft
earth and moss. He took extra trouble over the deep
scars in the ditch and the grass verge, and then stood
beside his motor-cycle and looked back towards the
lily of the valley patch. Not bad! Probably only the
police dogs would get it, and, with ten miles of road to
cover, they would be hours, perhaps days—plenty
long enough. The main thing in these jobs was to have
enough safety margin. He could have shot the man at
forty yards, but he had preferred to get to twenty. And
taking the watch and the wallet had been nice touches—pro
touches.</p>

<p class="pindent">Pleased with himself, the man heaved his machine
off its rest, vaulted smartly into the saddle and kicked
down on the starter. Slowly, so as not to show skid
marks, he accelerated away back down the road and
in a minute or so he was doing seventy again and the
wind had redrawn the empty turnip grin across
his face.</p>

<p class="pindent">Around the scene of the killing, the forest, which
had held its breath while it was done, slowly began to
breathe again.</p>

<hr class="tbk1"/>

<p class="pindent">James Bond had his first drink of the evening at
Fouquet’s. It was not a solid drink. One cannot drink
seriously in French cafés. Out of doors on a pavement
in the sun is no place for vodka or whisky or gin. A
<span class="it">fine à l’eau</span> is fairly serious, but it intoxicates without
tasting very good. A <span class="it">quart de champagne</span> or a <span class="it">champagne à
l’orange</span> is all right before luncheon, but in the evening
one <span class="it">quart</span> leads to another <span class="it">quart</span> and a bottle of indifferent
champagne is a bad foundation for the night.
Pernod is possible, but it should be drunk in company,
and anyway Bond had never liked the stuff because
its liquorice taste reminded him of his childhood.
No, in cafés you have to drink the least offensive of the
musical comedy drinks that go with them, and Bond
always had the same thing—an Americano—Bitter
Campari, Cinzano, a large slice of lemon peel and
soda. For the soda he always stipulated Perrier, for in
his opinion expensive soda water was the cheapest way
to improve a poor drink.</p>

<p class="pindent">When Bond was in Paris he invariably stuck to the
same addresses. He stayed at the Terminus Nord, because
he liked station hotels and because this was the
least pretentious and most anonymous of them. He had
luncheon at the Café de la Paix, the Rotonde or the
Dôme, because the food was good enough and it
amused him to watch the people. If he wanted a solid
drink he had it at Harry’s Bar, both because of the
solidity of the drinks and because, on his first ignorant
visit to Paris at the age of sixteen, he had done what
Harry’s advertisement in the <span class="it">Continental Daily Mail</span> had
told him to do and had said to his taxi-driver ‘Sank
Roo Doe Noo.’ That had started one of the memorable
evenings of his life, culminating in the loss, almost
simultaneous, of his virginity and his note-case. For
dinner, Bond went to one of the great restaurants—Véfour,
the Caneton, Lucas-Carton or the Cochon
d’Or. These he considered, whatever Michelin might
say about the Tour d’Argent, Maxim's and the like, to
have somehow avoided the tarnish of the expense account
and the dollar. Anyway, he preferred their cooking.
After dinner he generally went to the Place Pigalle
to see what would happen to him. When, as usual,
nothing did, he would walk home across Paris to the
Gare du Nord and go to bed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tonight Bond decided to tear up this dusty address-book
and have himself an old-fashioned ball. He was
on his way through Paris after a dismally failed assignment
on the Austro-Hungarian border. It had been a
question of getting a certain Hungarian out. Bond had
been sent from London specially to direct the operation
over the head of Station V. This had been unpopular
with the Vienna Station. There had been misunderstandings—wilful
ones. The man had been
killed in the frontier minefield. There would have to
be a Court of Inquiry. Bond was due back at his London
headquarters on the following day to make his report,
and the thought of it all depressed him. Today
had been so beautiful—one of those days when you
almost believe that Paris is beautiful and gay—and
Bond had decided to give the town just one more
chance. He would somehow find himself a girl who
was a real girl, and he would take her to dinner at
some make-believe place in the Bois like the Armenonville.
To clean the money-look out of her eyes—for it
would certainly be there—he would as soon as possible
give her fifty thousand francs. He would say to her:
‘I propose to call you Donatienne, or possibly Solange,
because these are names that suit my mood and the
evening. We knew each other before and you lent me
this money because I was in a jam. Here it is, and now
we will tell each other what we have been doing since
we last met in St Tropez just a year ago. In the meantime,
here is the menu and the wine list and you must
choose what will make you happy and fat.’ And she
would look relieved at not having to try any more, and
she would laugh and say: ‘But, James, I do not want
to be fat.’ And there they would be, started on the
myth of ‘Paris in the Spring’, and Bond would stay
sober and be interested in her and everything she said.
And, by God, by the end of the evening it would not
be his fault if it transpired that there was in fact no
shred of stuffing left in the hoary old fairy-tale of ‘A
good time in Paris’.</p>

<p class="pindent">Sitting in Fouquet’s, waiting for his Americano,
Bond smiled at his vehemence. He knew that he was
only playing at this fantasy for the satisfaction of
launching a last kick at a town he had cordially disliked
since the War. Since 1945, he had not had a
happy day in Paris. It was not that the town had sold
its body. Many towns have done that. It was its heart
that was gone—pawned to the tourists, pawned to the
Russians and Roumanians and Bulgars, pawned to the
scum of the world who had gradually taken the town
over. And, of course, pawned to the Germans. You
could see it in the people’s eyes—sullen, envious,
ashamed. Architecture? Bond glanced across the pavement
at the shiny black ribbons of cars off which the
sun glinted painfully. Everywhere it was the same as in
the Champs-Elysées. There were only two hours in
which you could even see the town—between five and
seven in the morning. After seven it was engulfed in a
thundering stream of black metal with which no beautiful
buildings, no spacious, tree-lined boulevards,
could compete.</p>

<p class="pindent">The waiter’s tray clattered down on the marble-topped
table. With a slick one-handed jerk that Bond
had never been able to copy, the waiter’s bottle-opener
prised the cap off the Perrier. The man slipped
the tab under the ice-bucket, said a mechanical ‘Voilà,
M’sieur’ and darted away. Bond put ice into his
drink, filled it to the top with soda and took a long pull
at it. He sat back and lit a Laurens jaune. Of course
the evening would be a disaster. Even supposing he
found the girl in the next hour or so, the contents
would certainly not stand up to the wrapping. On
closer examination she would turn out to have the
heavy, dank, wide-pored skin of the bourgeois French.
The blonde hair under the rakish velvet beret would
be brown at the roots and as coarse as piano wire. The
peppermint on the breath would not conceal the midday
garlic. The alluring figure would be intricately
scaffolded with wire and rubber. She would be from
Lille and she would ask him if he was American. And,
Bond smiled to himself, she or her maquereau would
probably steal his note-case. La ronde! He would be
back where he came in. More or less, that was. Well,
to hell with it!</p>

<p class="pindent">A battered black Peugeot 403 broke out of the
centre stream of traffic, cut across the inside line of
cars and pulled in to double park at the kerb. There
was the usual screaming of brakes, hooting and yelling.
Quite unmoved, a girl got out of the car and, leaving
the traffic to sort itself out, walked purposefully across
the sidewalk. Bond sat up. She had everything, but
absolutely everything that belonged in his fantasy. She
was tall and, although her figure was hidden by a light
raincoat, the way she moved and the way she held herself
promised that it would be beautiful. The face had
the gaiety and bravado that went with her driving,
but now there was impatience in the compressed lips
and the eyes fretted as she pushed diagonally through
the moving crowd on the pavement.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond watched her narrowly as she reached the edge
of the tables and came up the aisle. Of course it was
hopeless. She was coming to meet someone—her
lover. She was the sort of woman who always belongs
to somebody else. She was late for him. That’s why she
was in such a hurry. What damnable luck—right
down to the long blonde hair under the rakish beret!
And she was looking straight at him. She was
smiling . . . !</p>

<p class="pindent">Before Bond could pull himself together, the girl had
come up to his table and had drawn out a chair and
sat down.</p>

<p class="pindent">She smiled rather tautly into his startled eyes. ‘I’m
sorry I’m late, and I’m afraid we’ve got to get moving
at once. You’re wanted at the office.’ She added under
her breath: ‘Crash dive.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond jerked himself back to reality. Whoever she
was, she was certainly from ‘the firm’. ‘Crash dive’
was a slang expression the Secret Service had borrowed
from the Submarine Service. It meant bad news—the
worst. Bond dug into his pocket and slid some
coins over the tab. He said ‘Right. Let’s go,’ and got
up and followed her down through the tables and
across to her car. It was still obstructing the inner lane
of traffic. Any minute now there would be a policeman.
Angry faces glared at them as they climbed in.
The girl had left the engine running. She banged the
gears into second and slid out into the traffic.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked sideways at her. The pale skin was velvet.
The blonde hair was silk—to the roots. He said:
‘Where are you from and what’s it all about?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She said, concentrating on the traffic: ‘From the
Station. Grade two assistant. Number 765 on duty,
Mary Ann Russell off. I’ve no idea what it’s all about.
I just saw the signal from H.Q.—personal from M to
Head of Station. Most Immediate and all that. He was
to find you at once and if necessary use the Deuxième
to help. Head of F said you always went to the
same places when you were in Paris, and I and
another girl were given a list.’ She smiled. ‘I’d only
tried Harry’s Bar, and after Fouquet’s I was going to
start on the restaurants. It was marvellous picking you
up like that.’ She gave him a quick glance. ‘I hope I
wasn’t very clumsy.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said: ‘You were fine. How were you going to
handle it if I’d had a girl with me?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She laughed. ‘I was going to do much the same except
call you ‘sir’. I was only worried about how you’d
dispose of the girl. If she started a scene I was going to
offer to take her home in my car and for you to take a
taxi.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You sound pretty resourceful. How long have you
been in the Service?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Five years. This is my first time with a Station.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How do you like it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I like the work all right. The evenings and days off
drag a bit. It’s not easy to make friends in Paris without’—her
mouth turned down with irony—‘without
all the rest. I mean,’ she hastened to add, ‘I’m not a
prude and all that, but somehow the French make the
whole business such a bore. I mean I’ve had to give up
taking the Metro or buses. Whatever time of day it is,
you end up with your behind black and blue.’ She
laughed. ‘Apart from the boredom of it and not knowing
what to say to the man, some of the pinches really
hurt. It’s the limit. So to get around I bought this car
cheap, and other cars seem to keep out of my way. As
long as you don’t catch the other driver’s eye, you can
take on even the meanest of them. They’re afraid you
haven’t seen them. And they’re worried by the bashed-about
look of the car. They give you a wide berth.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They had come to the Rond Point. As if to demonstrate
her theory, she tore round it and went straight at
the line of traffic coming up from the Place de la Concorde.
Miraculously it divided and let her through
into the Avenue Matignon.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said: ‘Pretty good. But don’t make it a habit.
There may be some French Mary Anns about.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She laughed. She turned into the Avenue Gabrielle
and pulled up outside the Paris headquarters of the
Secret Service. ‘I only try that sort of manœuvre in the
line of duty.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got out and came round to her side of the car.
He said: ‘Well, thanks for picking me up. When this
whirl is over, can I pick you up in exchange? I don’t
get the pinches, but I’m just as bored in Paris as
you are.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Her eyes were blue and wide apart. They searched
his. She said seriously: ‘I’d like that. The switchboard
here can always find me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond reached in through the window and pressed
the hand on the wheel. He said ‘Good,’ and turned
and walked quickly in through the archway.</p>

<p class="pindent">Wing Commander Rattray, Head of Station F, was
a fattish man with pink cheeks and fair hair brushed
straight back. He dressed in a mannered fashion with
turned-back cuffs and double slits to his coat, bow-ties
and fancy waistcoats. He made a good-living, wine-and-food-society
impression in which only the slow,
rather cunning blue eyes struck a false note. He chain-smoked
Gauloises and his office stank of them. He
greeted Bond with relief. ‘Who found you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Russell. At Fouquet’s. Is she new?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Six months. She’s a good one. But take a pew.
There’s the hell of a flap on and I’ve got to brief you
and get you going.’ He bent to his intercom and
pressed down a switch. ‘Signal to M, please. Personal
from Head of Station. “Located 007 briefing now.”
Okay?’ He let go the switch.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond pulled a chair over by the open window to
keep away from the fog of Gauloises. The traffic
on the Champs-Elysées was a soft roar in the background.
Half an hour before he had been fed up with
Paris, glad to be going. Now he hoped he would be
staying.</p>

<p class="pindent">Head of F said: ‘Somebody got our dawn dispatch-rider
from <span class="calibre1">SHAPE</span> to the St Germain Station yesterday
morning. The weekly run from the <span class="calibre1">SHAPE</span> Intelligence
Division with the Summaries, Joint Intelligence
papers, Iron Curtain Order of Battle—all the top gen.
One shot in the back. Took his dispatch-case and his
wallet and watch.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said: ‘That’s bad. No chance that it was an
ordinary hold-up? Or do they think the wallet and
watch were cover?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="sc">Shape</span> Security can’t make up their minds. On the
whole they guess it was cover. Seven o’clock in the
morning’s a rum time for a hold-up. But you can argue
it out with them when you get down there. M’s sending
you as his personal representative. He’s worried as
hell. Apart from the loss of the Intelligence dope, their
I. people have never liked having one of our Stations
outside the Reservation so to speak. For years they’ve
been trying to get the St Germain unit incorporated
in the <span class="calibre1">SHAPE</span> Intelligence set-up. But you know what
M is, independent old devil. He’s never been happy
about <span class="calibre1">NATO</span> Security. Why, right in the <span class="calibre1">SHAPE</span> Intelligence
Division there are not only a couple of Frenchmen
and an Italian, but the head of their Counter Intelligence
and Security section is a German!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond whistled.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The trouble is that this damnable business is all
<span class="calibre1">SHAPE</span> needs to bring M to heel. Anyway, he says
you’re to get down there right away. I’ve fixed up
clearance for you. Got the passes. You’re to report to
Colonel Schreiber, Headquarters Command Security
Branch. American. Efficient chap. He’s been handling
the thing from the beginning. As far as I can gather,
he’s already done just about all there was to be done.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What’s he done? What actually happened?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Head of F picked up a map from his desk and
walked over with it. It was the big-scale Michelin
<span class="it">Environs de Paris</span>. He pointed with a pencil. ‘Here’s Versailles,
and here, just north of the park, is the big
junction of the Paris-Mantes and the Versailles autoroutes.
A couple of hundred yards north of that, on
N.184, is <span class="calibre1">SHAPE</span>. Every Wednesday, at seven in the
morning, a Special Services dispatch-rider leaves
<span class="calibre1">SHAPE</span> with the weekly Intelligence stuff I told you
about. He has to get to this little village called Fourqueux,
just outside St Germain, deliver his stuff to the
duty officer at our H.Q., and report back to <span class="calibre1">SHAPE</span> by
seven-thirty. Rather than go through all this built-up
area, for security reasons his orders are to take this
N.307 to St Nom, turn right-handed on to D.98 and
go under the autoroute and through the forest of St
Germain. The distance is about twelve kilometres, and
taking it easy he’ll do the trip in under a quarter of an
hour. Well, yesterday it was a corporal from the Corps
of Signals, good solid man called Bates, and when he
hadn’t reported back to <span class="calibre1">SHAPE</span> by seven-forty-five they
sent another rider to look for him. Not a trace, and he
hadn’t reported at our H.Q. By eight-fifteen the Security
Branch was on the job, and by nine the road-blocks
were up. The police and the Deuxième were
told and search parties got under way. The dogs found
him, but not till the evening around six, and by that
time if there had been any clues on the road they’d
been wiped out by the traffic.’ Head of F handed the
map to Bond and walked back to his desk. ‘And that’s
about the lot, except that all the usual steps have been
taken—frontiers, ports, aerodromes and so forth. But
that sort of thing won’t help. If it was a professional
job, whoever did it could have had the stuff out of the
country by midday or into an Embassy in Paris inside
an hour.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said impatiently: ‘Exactly! And so what the
hell does M expect me to do? Tell <span class="calibre1">SHAPE</span> Security to
do it all over again, but better? This sort of thing isn’t
my line at all. Bloody waste of time.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Head of F smiled sympathetically. ‘Matter of fact I
put much the same point of view to M over the scrambler.
Tactfully. The old man was quite reasonable.
Said he wanted to show <span class="calibre1">SHAPE</span> he was taking the business
just as seriously as they were. You happened to be
available and more or less on the spot, and he said you
had the sort of mind that might pick up the invisible
factor. I asked him what he meant, and he said that
at all closely guarded headquarters there’s bound to
be an invisible man—a man everyone takes so much
for granted that he just isn’t noticed—gardener, window-cleaner,
postman. I said that <span class="calibre1">SHAPE</span> had thought
of that, and that all those sort of jobs were done by
enlisted men. M told me not to be so literal-minded
and hung up.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. He could see M’s frown and hear the
crusty voice. He said: ‘All right, then. I’ll see what I
can do. Who do I report back to?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Here. M doesn’t want the St Germain unit to get
involved. Anything you have to say I’ll put straight on
the printer to London. But I may not be available
when you call up. I’ll make someone your duty officer
and you’ll be able to get them any time in the twenty-four
hours. Russell can do it. She picked you up. She
might as well carry you. Suit you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ said Bond. ‘That’ll be all right.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The battered Peugeot, commandeered by Rattray,
smelled of her. There were bits of her in the glove
compartment—half a packet of Suchard milk chocolate,
a twist of paper containing bobby pins, a paperback
John O’Hara, a single black suede glove. Bond
thought about her as far as the Etoile and then closed
his mind to her and pushed the car along fast through
the Bois. Rattray had said it would take about fifteen
minutes at fifty. Bond said to halve the speed and
double the time and to tell Colonel Schreiber that he
would be with him by nine-thirty. After the Porte de
St Cloud there was little traffic, and Bond held seventy
on the autoroute until the second exit road came up
on his right and there was the red arrow for <span class="calibre1">SHAPE</span>.
Bond turned up the slope and on to N.184. Two hundred
yards farther, in the centre of the road, was the
traffic policeman Bond had been told to look out for.
The policeman waved him in through the big gates on
the left and he pulled up at the first check-point. A
grey-uniformed American policeman hung out of his
cabin and glanced at his pass. He was told to pull inside
and hold it. Now a French policeman took his pass,
noted the details on a printed form clipped to a board,
gave him a large plastic windscreen number and
waved him on. As Bond pulled in to the car park,
with theatrical suddenness a hundred arc-lights blazed
and lit up the acre of low-lying hutments in front of
him as if it was day. Feeling naked, Bond walked
across the open gravel beneath the flags of the <span class="calibre1">NATO</span>
countries and ran up the four shallow steps to the wide
glass doors that gave entrance to the Supreme Headquarters
Allied Forces Europe. Now there was the
main Security desk. American and French military
police again checked his pass and noted the details.
He was handed over to a red-capped British M.P. and
led off down the main corridor past endless office
doors. They bore no names but the usual alphabetical
abracadabra of all headquarters. One said <span class="calibre1">COMSTRIK-FLTLANT
AND SACLANT LIAISON TO SACEUR</span>. Bond
asked what it meant. The military policeman, either
ignorant or, more probably, security-minded, said
stolidly: ‘Couldn’t rightly say, sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Behind a door that said <span class="it">Colonel G. A. Schreiber. Chief
of Security. Headquarters Command</span>, was a ramrod-straight,
middle-aged American with greying hair and
the politely negative manner of a bank manager.
There were several family photographs in silver frames
on his desk and a vase containing one white rose. There
was no smell of tobacco smoke in the room. After cautiously
amiable preliminaries, Bond congratulated the
Colonel on his security. He said: ‘All these checks and
double checks don’t make it easy for the opposition.
Have you ever lost anything before, or have you ever
found signs of a serious attempt at a coup?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No to both questions, Commander. I’m quite satisfied
about Headquarters. It’s only the outlying units
that worry me. Apart from this section of your Secret
Service, we have various detached signal units. Then,
of course, there are the Home Ministries of fourteen
different nations. I can’t answer for what may leak
from those quarters.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It can’t be an easy job,’ agreed Bond. ‘Now, about
this mess. Has anything else come up since Wing Commander
Rattray spoke to you last?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Got the bullet. Luger. Severed the spinal cord.
Probably fired at around thirty yards, give or take ten
yards. Assuming our man was riding a straight course,
the bullet must have been fired from dead astern on a
level trajectory. Since it can’t have been a man standing
in the road, the killer must have been moving in or
on some vehicle.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So your man would have seen him in the driving-mirror?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Probably.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If your riders find themselves being followed, do they
have any instructions about taking evasive action?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Colonel smiled slightly. ‘Sure. They’re told to
go like hell.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And at what speed did your man crash?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not fast, they think. Between twenty and forty.
What are you getting at, Commander?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I was wondering if you’d decided whether it was a
pro or an amateur job. If your man wasn’t trying to
get away, and assuming he saw the killer in his mirror,
which I agree is only a probability, that suggests that
he accepted the man on his tail as friend rather than
foe. That could mean some sort of a disguise that
would fit in with the set-up here—something your
man would accept even at that hour of the morning.’</p>

<p class="pindent">A small frown had been gathering across Colonel
Schreiber’s smooth forehead. ‘Commander,’ there was
an edge of tension in the voice, ‘we have, of course,
been considering every angle of this case, including the
one you mention. At midday yesterday the Commanding
General declared emergency in this matter, standing
security and security ops committees were set up,
and from that moment on every angle, every hint of a
clue, has been systematically run to earth. And I can
tell you, Commander,’ the Colonel raised one well-manicured
hand and let it descend in soft emphasis on
his blotting-pad, ‘any man who can come up with an
even remotely original idea on this case will have to be
closely related to Einstein. There is nothing, repeat
nothing, to go on in this case whatsoever.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled sympathetically. He got to his feet. ‘In
that case, Colonel, I won’t waste any more of your
time this evening. If I could just have the minutes of
the various meetings to bring myself up to date, and if
one of your men could show me the way to the canteen
and my quarters . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sure, sure.’ The Colonel pressed a bell. A young
crew-cutted aide came in. ‘Proctor, show the Commander
to his room in the V.I.P. wing, would you,
and then take him along to the bar and the canteen.’
He turned to Bond. ‘I’ll have those papers ready for
you after you’ve had a meal and a drink. They’ll be in
my office. They can’t be taken out, of course, but
you’ll find everything to hand next door, and Proctor
will be able to fill you in on anything that’s missing.’
He held out his hand. ‘Okay? Then we’ll meet again
in the morning.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said good night and followed the aide out. As
he walked along the neutral-painted, neutral-smelling
corridors, he reflected that this was probably the
most hopeless assignment he had ever been on. If the
top security brains of fourteen countries were stumped,
what hope had he got? By the time he was in bed that
night, in the Spartan luxury of the visitors’ overnight
quarters, Bond had decided he would give it a couple
more days—largely for the sake of keeping in touch
with Mary Ann Russell for as long as possible—and
then chuck it. On this decision he fell immediately
into a deep and untroubled sleep.</p>

<hr class="tbk1"/>

<p class="pindent">Not two, but four days later, as the dawn came up
over the Forest of St Germain, James Bond was lying
along the thick branch of an oak tree keeping watch
over a small empty glade that lay deep among the
trees bordering D.98, the road of the murder.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was dressed from head to foot in parachutists’
camouflage—green, brown and black. Even his
hands were covered with the stuff, and there was
a hood over his head with slits cut for the eyes
and mouth. It was good camouflage which would be
still better when the sun was higher and the shadows
blacker, and from anywhere on the ground, even
directly below the high branch, he could not be
seen.</p>

<p class="pindent">It had come about like this. The first two days at
<span class="calibre1">SHAPE</span> had been the expected waste of time. Bond had
achieved nothing except to make himself mildly unpopular
with the persistence of his double-checking
questions. On the morning of the third day he was
about to go and say his goodbyes when he had a telephone
call from the Colonel. ‘Oh, Commander,
thought I’d let you know that the last team of police
dogs got in late last night—your idea that it might be
worth while covering the whole forest. Sorry’—the
voice sounded un-sorry—‘but negative, absolutely
negative.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh. My fault for the wasted time.’ As much to
annoy the Colonel as anything, Bond said: ‘Mind if I
have a talk with the handler?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sure, sure. Anything you want. By the way, Commander,
how long are you planning to be around?
Glad to have you with us for as long as you like. But
it’s a question of your room. Seems there’s a big party
coming in from Holland in a few days’ time. Top level
staff course or something of the kind, and Admin says
they’re a bit pushed for space.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had not expected to get on well with Colonel
Schreiber and he had not done so. He said amiably:
‘I’ll see what my Chief has to say and call you back,
Colonel.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Do that, would you.’ The Colonel’s voice was
equally polite, but the manners of both men were running
out and the two receivers broke the line simultaneously.</p>

<p class="pindent">The chief handler was a Frenchman from the Landes.
He had the quick sly eyes of a poacher. Bond
met him at the kennels, but the handler’s proximity
was too much for the Alsatians and, to get away from
the noise, he took Bond into the duty-room, a tiny
office with binoculars hanging from pegs, and water-proofs,
gumboots, dog-harness and other gear stacked
round the walls. There were a couple of deal chairs and
a table covered with a large-scale map of the Forest of
St Germain. This had been marked off into pencilled
squares. The handler made a gesture over the map.
‘Our dogs covered it all, Monsieur. There is nothing
there.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Do you mean to say they didn’t check once?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The handler scratched his head. ‘We had trouble
with a bit of game, Monsieur. There was a hare or two.
A couple of foxes’ earths. We had quite a time getting
them away from a clearing near the Carrefour Royal.
They probably still smelled the gipsies.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh.’ Bond was only mildly interested. ‘Show me.
Who were these gipsies?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The handler pointed daintily with a grimy little
finger. ‘These are the names from the old days. Here
is the Etoile Parfaite, and here, where the killing took
place, is the Carrefour des Curieux. And here, forming
the bottom of the triangle, is the Carrefour Royal. It
makes,’ he added dramatically, ‘a cross with the road
of death.’ He took a pencil out of his pocket and made
a dot just off the cross-roads. ‘And this is the clearing,
Monsieur. There was a gipsy caravan there for most
of the winter. They left last month. Cleaned the place
up all right, but, for the dogs, their scent will hang
about there for months.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond thanked him, and after inspecting and admiring
the dogs and making some small talk about the
handler’s profession, he got into the Peugeot and went
off to the gendarmerie in St Germain. ‘Yes, certainly
they had known the gipsies. Real Romany-looking
fellows. Hardly spoke a word of French, but they had
behaved themselves. There had been no complaints.
Six men and two women. No. No one had seen them
go. One morning they just weren’t there any more.
Might have been gone a week for all one knew. They
had chosen an isolated spot.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took the D.98 through the forest. When the
great autoroute bridge showed up a quarter of a mile
ahead over the road, Bond accelerated and then
switched off the engine and coasted silently until he
came to the Carrefour Royal. He stopped and got out
of the car without a sound, and, feeling rather foolish,
softly entered the forest and walked with great circumspection
towards where the clearing would be.
Twenty yards inside the trees he came to it. He stood
in the fringe of bushes and trees and examined it carefully.
Then he walked in and went over it from end
to end.</p>

<p class="pindent">The clearing was about as big as two tennis courts
and floored in thick grass and moss. There was one
large patch of lilies of the valley and, under the bordering
trees, a scattering of bluebells. To one side
there was a low mound, perhaps a tumulus, completely
surrounded and covered with brambles and brier
roses now thickly in bloom. Bond walked round this
and gazed in among the roots, but there was nothing
to see except the earthy shape of the mound.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took one last look round and then went to the
corner of the clearing that would be nearest to the
road. Here there was easy access through the trees.
Were there traces of a path, a slight flattening of the
leaves? Not more than would have been left by the
gipsies or last year’s picnickers. On the edge of the
road there was a narrow passage between two trees.
Casually Bond bent to examine the trunks. He stiffened
and dropped to a crouch. With a fingernail, he
delicately scraped away a narrow sliver of caked mud.
It hid a deep scratch in the tree-trunk. He caught the
scraps of mud in his free hand. He now spat and
moistened the mud and carefully filled up the scratch
again. There were three camouflaged scratches on one
tree and four on the other. Bond walked quickly out
of the trees on to the road. His car had stopped on a
slight slope leading down under the autoroute bridge.
Although there was some protection from the boom of
the traffic on the autoroute, Bond pushed the car,
jumped in and only engaged the gears when he was
well under the bridge.</p>

<p class="pindent">And now Bond was back in the clearing, above it,
and he still did not know if his hunch had been right.
It had been M’s dictum that had put him on the scent—if
it was a scent—and the mention of the gipsies.
‘It was the gipsies the dogs smelled . . . Most of the
winter . . . they went last month. No complaints . . .
One morning they just weren’t there any more.’ The
invisible factor. The invisible man. The people who
are so much part of the background that you don’t
know if they’re there or not. Six men and two girls and
they hardly spoke a word of French. Good cover,
gipsies. You could be a foreigner and yet not a
foreigner, because you were only a gipsy. Some of
them had gone off in the caravan. Had some of them
stayed, built themselves a hide-out during the winter,
a secret place from which the hijacking of the top
secret dispatches had been the first sortie? Bond had
thought he was building fantasies until he found the
scratches, the carefully camouflaged scratches, on the
two trees. They were just at the height where, if one
was carrying any kind of a cycle, the pedals might
catch against the bark. It could all be a pipe-dream,
but it was good enough for Bond. The only question
in his mind was whether these people had made a one-time-only
coup or whether they were so confident of
their security that they would try again. He confided
only in Station F. Mary Ann Russell told him to be
careful. Head of F, more constructively, ordered his
unit at St Germain to co-operate. Bond said goodbye
to Colonel Schreiber and moved to a camp-bed in the
unit’s H.Q.—an anonymous house in an anonymous
village back-street. The unit had provided the camouflage
outfit and the four Secret Service men who ran
the unit had happily put themselves under Bond’s
orders. They realised as well as Bond did that if Bond
managed to wipe the eye of the whole security
machine of <span class="calibre1">SHAPE</span>, the Secret Service would have won
a priceless feather in its cap <span class="it">vis-à-vis</span> the <span class="calibre1">SHAPE</span> High
Command, and M’s worries over the independence of
his unit would be gone for ever.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond, lying along the oak branch, smiled to himself.
Private armies, private wars. How much energy
they siphoned off from the common cause, how much
fire they directed away from the common enemy!</p>

<p class="pindent">Six-thirty. Time for breakfast. Cautiously Bond’s
right hand fumbled in his clothing and came up to the
slit of his mouth. Bond made the glucose tablet last as
long as possible and then sucked another. His eyes
never left the glade. The red squirrel that had appeared
at first light and had been steadily eating away
at young beech shoots ever since, ran a few feet nearer
to the rose-bushes on the mound, picked up something
and began turning it in his paws and nibbling at it.
Two wood-pigeons that had been noisily courting
among the thick grass started to make clumsy, fluttering
love. A pair of hedge-sparrows went busily on
collecting bits and pieces for a nest they were tardily
building in a thorn-bush. The fat thrush finally located
its worm and began pulling at it, its legs braced. Bees
clustered thick among the roses on the mound, and
from where he was, perhaps twenty yards away from
and above the mound, Bond could just hear their
summery sound. It was a scene from a fairy-tale—the
roses, the lilies of the valley, the birds and the great
shafts of sunlight lancing down through the tall trees
into the pool of glistening green. Bond had climbed to
his hide-out at four in the morning and he had never
examined so closely or for so long the transition from
night to a glorious day. He suddenly felt rather foolish.
Any moment now and some damned bird would come
and sit on his head!</p>

<p class="pindent">It was the pigeons that gave the first alarm. With a
loud clatter they took off and dashed into the trees.
All the birds followed, and the squirrel. Now the glade
was quite quiet except for the soft hum of the bees.
What had sounded the alarm? Bond’s heart began to
thump. His eyes hunted, quartering the glade for a
clue. Something was moving among the roses. It was a
tiny movement, but an extraordinary one. Slowly,
inch by inch, a single thorny stem, an unnaturally
straight and rather thick one, was rising through the
upper branches. It went on rising until it was a clear
foot above the bush. Then it stopped. There was a
solitary pink rose at the tip of the stem. Separated
from the bush, it looked unnatural, but only if one
happened to have watched the whole process. At a
casual glance it was a stray stem and nothing else.
Now, silently, the petals of the rose seemed to swivel
and expand, the yellow pistils drew aside and sun
glinted on a glass lens the size of a shilling. The lens
seemed to be looking straight at Bond, but then very,
very slowly, the rose-eye began to turn on its stem and
continued to turn until the lens was again looking at
Bond and the whole glade had been minutely surveyed.
As if satisfied, the petals softly swivelled to
cover the eye and very slowly the single rose descended
to join the others.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s breath came out with a rush. He momentarily
closed his eyes to rest them. Gipsies! If that
piece of machinery was any evidence, inside the
mound, deep down in the earth, was certainly the
most professional left-behind spy unit that had ever
been devised—far more brilliant than anything England
had prepared to operate in the wake of a successful
German invasion, far better than what the Germans
themselves had left behind in the Ardennes. A
shiver of excitement and anticipation—almost of fear—ran
down Bond’s spine. So he had been right! But
what was to be the next act?</p>

<p class="pindent">Now, from the direction of the mound, came a thin
high-pitched whine—the sound of an electric motor
at very high revs. The rose-bush trembled slightly.
The bees took off, hovered, and settled again. Slowly,
a jagged fissure formed down the centre of the big bush
and smoothly widened. Now the two halves of the bush
were opening like double doors. The dark aperture
broadened until Bond could see the roots of the bush
running into the earth on both sides of the opening
doorway. The whine of machinery was louder and
there was a glint of metal from the edges of the curved
doors. It was like the opening of a hinged Easter egg.
In a moment the two segments stood apart and the
two halves of the rose-bush, still alive with bees, were
splayed widely open. Now the inside of the metal
caisson that supported the earth and the roots of the
bush were naked to the sun. There was a glint of pale
electric light from the dark aperture between the
curved doors. The whine of the motor had stopped. A
head and shoulders appeared, and then the rest of the
man. He climbed softly out and crouched, looking
sharply round the glade. There was a gun—a Luger—in
his hand. Satisfied, he turned and gestured into
the shaft. The head and shoulders of a second man appeared.
He handed up three pairs of what looked like
snow-shoes and ducked out of sight. The first man selected
a pair and knelt and strapped them over his
boots. Now he moved about more freely, leaving no
footprints, for the grass flattened only momentarily
under the wide mesh and then rose slowly again.
Bond smiled to himself. Clever bastards!</p>

<p class="pindent">The second man emerged. He was followed by a
third. Between them they manhandled a motor-cycle
out of the shaft and stood holding it slung between
them by harness webbing while the first man, who was
clearly the leader, knelt and strapped the snow-shoes
under their boots. Then, in single file, they moved
off through the trees towards the road. There was
something extraordinarily sinister about the way
they softly high-stepped along through the shadows,
lifting and carefully placing each big webbed foot in
turn.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond let out a long sigh of released tension and laid
his head softly down on the branch to relax the strain
in his neck muscles. So that was the score! Even the
last small detail could now be added to the file. While
the two underlings were dressed in grey overalls, the
leader was wearing the uniform of the Royal Corps of
Signals and his motor-cycle was an olive green B.S.A.
M.20 with a British Army registration number on its
petrol tank. No wonder the <span class="calibre1">SHAPE</span> dispatch-rider had
let him get within range. And what did the unit do
with its top secret booty? Probably radioed the cream
of it out at night. Instead of the periscope, a rose-stalk
aerial would rise up from the bush, the pedal generator
would get going deep down under the earth and
off would go the high-speed cipher groups. Ciphers?
There would be many good enemy secrets down that
shaft if Bond could round up the unit when it was outside
the hide-out. And what a chance to feed back
phoney intelligence to <span class="calibre1">GRU</span>, the Soviet Military Intelligence
Apparat which was presumably the control! Bond’s thoughts raced.</p>

<p class="pindent">The two underlings were coming back. They went
into the shaft and the rose-bush closed over it. The
leader with his machine would be among the bushes
on the verge of the road. Bond glanced at his watch.
Six-fifty-five. Of course! He would be waiting to see if
a dispatch-rider came along. Either he did not know
the man he had killed was doing a weekly run, which
was unlikely, or he was assuming that <span class="calibre1">SHAPE</span> would
now change the routine for additional security. These
were careful people. Probably their orders were to
clean up as much as possible before the summer came
and there were too many holiday-makers about in the
forest. Then the unit might be pulled out and put back
again in the winter. Who could say what the long-term
plans were? Sufficient that the leader was preparing
for another kill.</p>

<p class="pindent">The minutes ticked by. At seven-ten the leader reappeared.
He stood in the shadow of a big tree at the
edge of the clearing and whistled once on a brief, high,
birdlike note. Immediately the rose-bush began to
open and the two underlings came out and followed
the leader back into the trees. In two minutes they
were back with the motor-cycle slung between them.
The leader, after a careful look round to see that they
had left no traces, followed them down into the shaft
and the two halves of the rose-bush closed swiftly
behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Half an hour later life had started up in the glade
again. An hour later still, when the high sun had
darkened the shadows, James Bond silently edged
backwards along his branch, dropped softly on to a
patch of moss behind some brambles and melted
carefully back into the forest.</p>

<hr class="tbk1"/>

<p class="pindent">That evening Bond’s routine call with Mary Ann
Russell was a stormy one. She said: ‘You’re crazy.
I’m not going to let you do it. I’m going to get Head
of F to ring up Colonel Schreiber and tell him the
whole story. This is <span class="calibre1">SHAPE</span>’s job. Not yours.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said sharply: ‘You’ll do nothing of the sort.
Colonel Schreiber says he’s perfectly happy to let me
make a dummy run tomorrow morning instead of the
duty dispatch-rider. That’s all he needs to know at
this stage. Reconstruction of the crime sort of thing.
He couldn’t care less. He’s practically closed the file
on this business. Now, be a good girl and do as you’re
told. Just put my report on the printer to M. He’ll
see the point of me cleaning this thing up. He won’t
object.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Damn M! Damn you! Damn the whole silly Service!’
There were angry tears in the voice. ‘You’re just
a lot of children playing at Red Indians. Taking these
people on by yourself! It’s—it’s showing off. That’s
all it is. Showing off.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was beginning to get annoyed. He said:
‘That’s enough, Mary Ann. Put that report on the
printer. I’m sorry, but it’s an order.’</p>

<p class="pindent">There was resignation in the voice. ‘Oh, all right.
You don’t have to pull your rank on me. But don’t get
hurt. At least you’ll have the boys from the local
Station to pick up the bits. Good luck.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thanks, Mary Ann. And will you have dinner with
me tomorrow night? Some place like Armenonville.
Pink champagne and gipsy violins. Paris in the spring
routine.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ she said seriously. ‘I’d like that. But then take
care all the more, would you? Please?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course I will. Don’t worry. Good night.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘ ’Night.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond spent the rest of the evening putting a last
high polish on his plans and giving a final briefing to
the four men from the Station.</p>

<hr class="tbk1"/>

<p class="pindent">It was another beautiful day. Bond, sitting comfortably
astride the throbbing B.S.A. waiting for the
off, could hardly believe in the ambush that would
now be waiting for him just beyond the Carrefour
Royal. The corporal from the Signal Corps who had
handed him his empty dispatch-case and was about to
give him the signal to go said: ‘You look as if you’d
been in the Royal Corps all your life, sir. Time for a
hair-cut soon, I’d say, but the uniform’s bang on. How
d’you like the bike, sir?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Goes like a dream. I’d forgotten what fun these
damned things are.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Give me a nice little Austin A.40 any day,
sir.’ The corporal looked at his watch. ‘Seven
o’clock just coming up.’ He held up his thumb.
‘Okay.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond pulled the goggles down over his eyes, lifted a
hand to the corporal, kicked the machine into gear
and wheeled off across the gravel and through the
main gates.</p>

<p class="pindent">Off 184 and on to 307, through Bailly and Noisy-le-Roi
and there was the straggle of St Nom. Here he
would be turning sharp right on to D.98—the ‘route
de la mort’, as the handler had called it. Bond pulled
into the grass verge and once more looked to the long-barrel
.45 Colt. He put the warm gun back against his
stomach and left the jacket button undone. On your
marks! Get set . . . !</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took the sharp corner and accelerated up to
fifty. The viaduct carrying the Paris autoroute loomed
up ahead. The dark mouth of the tunnel beneath it
opened and swallowed him. The noise of his exhaust
was gigantic, and for an instant there was a tunnel
smell of cold and damp. Then he was out in the sunshine
again and immediately across the Carrefour
Royal. Ahead the oily tarmac glittered dead straight
for two miles through the enchanted forest and there
was a sweet smell of leaves and dew. Bond cut his
speed to forty. The driving-mirror by his left hand
shivered slightly with his speed. It showed nothing but
an empty unfurling vista of road between lines of trees
that curled away behind him like a green wake. No
sign of the killer. Had he taken fright? Had there been
some hitch? But then there was a tiny black speck in
the centre of the convex glass—a midge that became
a fly and then a bee and then a beetle. Now it was a
crash-helmet bent low over handle-bars between two
big black paws. God, he was coming fast! Bond’s eyes
flickered from the mirror to the road ahead and back
to the mirror. When the killer’s right hand went for
his gun . . . !</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond slowed—thirty-five, thirty, twenty. Ahead
the tarmac was smooth as metal. A last quick look in
the mirror. The right hand had left the handle-bars.
The sun on the man’s goggles made huge fiery eyes
below the rim of the crash-helmet. Now! Bond braked
fiercely and skidded the B.S.A. through forty-five degrees,
killing the engine. He was not quite quick enough
on the draw. The killer’s gun flared twice and a bullet
tore into the saddle-springs beside Bond’s thigh. But
then the Colt spoke its single word, and the killer and
his B.S.A., as if lassoed from within the forest, veered
crazily off the road, leapt the ditch and crashed head-on
into the trunk of a beech. For a moment the tangle
of man and machinery clung to the broad trunk and
then, with a metallic death-rattle, toppled backwards
into the grass.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got off his machine and walked over to the
ugly twist of khaki and smoking steel. There was no
need to feel for a pulse. Wherever the bullet had
struck, the crash-helmet had smashed like an eggshell.
Bond turned away and thrust his gun back into the
front of his tunic. He had been lucky. It would not do
to press his luck. He got on the B.S.A. and accelerated
back down the road.</p>

<p class="pindent">He leant the B.S.A. up against one of the scarred
trees just inside the forest and walked softly through to
the edge of the clearing. He took up his stand in the
shadow of the big beech. He moistened his lips and
gave, as near as he could, the killer’s bird-whistle. He
waited. Had he got the whistle wrong? But then the
bush trembled and the high thin whine began. Bond
hooked his right thumb through his belt within inches
of his gun-butt. He hoped he would not have to do any
more killing. The two underlings had not seemed to be
armed. With any luck they would come quietly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now the curved doors were open. From where he
was, Bond could not see down the shaft, but within
seconds the first man was out and putting on his snow-shoes
and the second followed. Snow-shoes! Bond’s
heart missed a beat. He had forgotten them! They
must be hidden back there in the bushes. Blasted fool!
Would they notice?</p>

<p class="pindent">The two men came slowly towards him, delicately
placing their feet. When he was about twenty feet
away, the leading man said something softly in what
sounded like Russian. When Bond did not reply, the
two men stopped in their tracks. They stared at him in
astonishment, waiting perhaps for the answer to a
password. Bond sensed trouble. He whipped out his
gun and moved towards them, crouching. ‘Hands up.’
He gestured with the muzzle of the Colt. The leading
man shouted an order and threw himself forward. At
the same time the second man made a dash back towards
the hide-out. A rifle boomed from among the
trees and the man’s right leg buckled under him. The
men from the Station broke cover and came running.
Bond fell to one knee and clubbed upwards with his
gun-barrel at the hurtling body. It made contact, but
then the man was on him. Bond saw finger-nails flashing
towards his eyes, ducked and ran into an upper-cut.
Now a hand was at his right wrist and his gun
was being slowly turned on him. Not wanting to
kill, he had kept the safety catch up. He tried to get
his thumb to it. A boot hit him in the side of the head
and he let the gun go and fell back. Through a red
mist he saw the muzzle of the gun pointing at his face.
The thought flashed through his mind that he was
going to die—die for showing mercy . . . !</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly the gun-muzzle had gone and the weight
of the man was off him. Bond got to his knees and then
to his feet. The body, spread-eagled in the grass beside
him, gave a last kick. There were bloody rents in
the back of the dungarees. Bond looked round. The
four men from the Station were in a group. Bond
undid the strap of his crash-helmet and rubbed
the side of his head. He said: ‘Well, thanks. Who
did it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Nobody answered. The men looked embarrassed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked towards them, puzzled. ‘What’s
up?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly Bond caught a trace of movement behind
the men. An extra leg showed—a woman’s leg. Bond
laughed out loud. The men grinned sheepishly and
looked behind them. Mary Ann Russell, in a brown
shirt and black jeans, came out from behind them
with her hands up. One of the hands held what looked
like a .22 target pistol. She brought her hands down
and tucked the pistol into the top of her jeans. She
came up to Bond. She said anxiously. ‘You won’t
blame anybody, will you? I just wouldn’t let them
leave this morning without me.’ Her eyes pleaded.
‘Rather lucky I did come, really. I mean, I just happened
to get to you first. No one wanted to shoot for
fear of hitting you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled into her eyes. He said: ‘If you hadn’t
come, I’d have had to break that dinner date.’
He turned back to the men, his voice businesslike.
‘All right. One of you take the motor-bike
and report the gist of this to Colonel Schreiber. Say
we’re waiting for his team before we take a look at
the hide-out. And would he include a couple of anti-sabotage
men. That shaft may be booby-trapped.
All right?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took the girl by the arm. He said: ‘Come over
here. I want to show you a bird’s nest.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Is that an order?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes.’</p>
