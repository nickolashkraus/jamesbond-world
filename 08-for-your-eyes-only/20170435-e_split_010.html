<p class="line19">———— * ————</p>

<p class="line2"><span class="sc">‘In</span> this pizniss is much risico.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The words came softly through the thick brown
moustache. The hard black eyes moved slowly over
Bond’s face and down to Bond’s hands which were
carefully shredding a paper match on which was
printed <span class="it">Albergo Colombo d’Oro</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond felt the inspection. The same surreptitious
examination had been going on since he had met
the man two hours before at the rendezvous in the
Excelsior bar. Bond had been told to look for a man
with a heavy moustache who would be sitting by himself
drinking an Alexandra. Bond had been amused
by this secret recognition signal. The creamy, feminine
drink was so much cleverer than the folded newspaper,
the flower in the buttonhole, the yellow gloves
that were the hoary, slipshod call-signs between agents.
It had also the great merit of being able to operate
alone, without its owner. And Kristatos had started
off with a little test. When Bond had come into the
bar and looked round there had been perhaps twenty
people in the room. None of them had a moustache.
But on a corner table at the far side of the tall, discreet
room, flanked by a saucer of olives and another of
cashew nuts, stood the tall-stemmed glass of cream
and vodka. Bond went straight over to the table, pulled
out a chair and sat down.</p>

<p class="pindent">The waiter came. ‘Good evening, sir. Signor Kristatos
is at the telephone.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond nodded. ‘A Negroni. With Gordon’s, please.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The waiter walked back to the bar. ‘Negroni. Uno.
Gordon’s.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I am so sorry.’ The big hairy hand picked up the
small chair as if it had been as light as a match-box
and swept it under the heavy hips. ‘I had to have a
word with Alfredo.’</p>

<p class="pindent">There had been no handshake. These were old
acquaintances. In the same line of business, probably.
Something like import and export. The younger one
looked American. No. Not with those clothes. English.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond returned the fast serve. ‘How’s his little boy?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The black eyes of Signor Kristatos narrowed.
Yes, they had said this man was a professional. He
spread his hands. ‘Much the same. What can you
expect?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Polio is a terrible thing.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Negroni came. The two men sat back comfortably,
each one satisfied that he had to do with a
man in the same league. This was rare in ‘The
Game’. So many times, before one had even started
on a tandem assignment like this, one had lost confidence
in the outcome. There was so often, at least in
Bond’s imagination, a faint smell of burning in the air
at such a rendezvous. He knew it for the sign that the
fringe of his cover had already started to smoulder.
In due course the smouldering fabric would burst into
flames and he would be <span class="it">brûlé</span>. Then the game would
be up and he would have to decide whether to pull out
or wait and get shot at by someone. But at this meeting
there had been no fumbling.</p>

<p class="pindent">Later that evening, at the little restaurant off the
Piazza di Spagna called the Colomba d’Oro, Bond
was amused to find that he was still on probation.
Kristatos was still watching and weighing him, wondering
if he could be trusted. This remark about the
risky business was as near as Kristatos had so far got
to admitting that there existed any business between
the two of them. Bond was encouraged. He had not
really believed in Kristatos. But surely all these precautions
could only mean that M’s intuition had paid
off—that Kristatos knew something big.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond dropped the last shred of match into the ashtray.
He said mildly: ‘I was once taught that any business
that pays more than ten per cent or is conducted
after nine o’clock at night is a dangerous business.
The business which brings us together pays up to one
thousand per cent and is conducted almost exclusively
at night. On both counts it is obviously a risky
business.’ Bond lowered his voice. ‘Funds are available.
Dollars, Swiss francs, Venezuelan bolivars—anything
convenient.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That makes me glad. I have already too much lire.’
Signor Kristatos picked up the folio menu. ‘But let us
feed on something. One should not decide important
pizniss on a hollow stomach.’</p>

<hr class="tbk1"/>

<p class="pindent">A week earlier M had sent for Bond. M was in a bad
temper. ‘Got anything on, 007?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Only paper-work, sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What do you mean, only paper-work?’ M jerked
his pipe towards his loaded in-tray. ‘Who hasn’t got
paper-work?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I meant nothing active, sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, say so.’ M picked up a bundle of dark red
files tied together with tape and slid them so sharply
across the desk that Bond had to catch them. ‘And
here’s some more paper-work. Scotland Yard stuff
mostly—their narcotics people. Wads from the Home
Office and the Ministry of Health, and some nice
thick reports from the International Opium Control
people in Geneva. Take it away and read it. You’ll
need today and most of tonight. Tomorrow you fly
to Rome and get after the big men. Is that clear?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said that it was. The state of M’s temper was
also explained. There was nothing that made him
more angry than having to divert his staff from their
primary duty. This duty was espionage, and when
necessary sabotage and subversion. Anything else was
a misuse of the Service and of Secret Funds which,
God knows, were meagre enough.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Any questions?’ M’s jaw stuck out like the prow of a
ship. The jaw seemed to tell Bond to pick up the files
and get the hell out of the office and let M move on to
something important.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond knew that a part of all this—if only a small
part—was an act. M had certain bees in his bonnet.
They were famous in the Service, and M knew they
were. But that did not mean that he would allow them
to stop buzzing. There were queen bees, like the misuse
of the Service, and the search for true as distinct
from wishful intelligence, and there were worker bees.
These included such idiosyncrasies as not employing
men with beards, or those who were completely bilingual,
instantly dismissing men who tried to bring
pressure to bear on him through family relationships
with members of the Cabinet, mistrusting men or
women who were too ‘dressy’, and those who called
him ‘sir’ off-duty; and having an exaggerated faith in
Scotsmen. But M was ironically conscious of his obsessions,
as, thought Bond, a Churchill or a Montgomery
were about theirs. He never minded his bluff,
as it partly was, being called on any of them. Moreover,
he would never have dreamed of sending Bond
out on an assignment without proper briefing.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond knew all this. He said mildly: ‘Two things,
sir. Why are we taking this thing on, and what lead, if
any, have Station I got towards the people involved
in it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">M gave Bond a hard, sour look. He swivelled his
chair sideways so that he could watch the high, scudding
October clouds through the broad window. He
reached out for his pipe, blew through it sharply, and
then, as if this action had let off the small head of
steam, replaced it gently on the desk. When he spoke,
his voice was patient, reasonable. ‘As you can imagine,
007, I do not wish the Service to become involved in
this drug business. Earlier this year I had to take you
off other duties for a fortnight so that you could go to
Mexico and chase off that Mexican grower. You
nearly got yourself killed. I sent you as a favour to the
Special Branch. When they asked for you again to
tackle this Italian gang I refused. Ronnie Vallance
went behind my back to the Home Office and the
Ministry of Health. The Ministers pressed me. I said
that you were needed here and that I had no one else
to spare. Then the two Ministers went to the P.M.’ M
paused. ‘And that was that. I must say the P.M. was
very persuasive. Took the line that heroin, in the
quantities that have been coming in, is an instrument
of psychological warfare—that it saps a country’s
strength. He said he wouldn’t be surprised to find
that this wasn’t just a gang of Italians out to make big
money—that subversion and not money was at the
back of it.’ M smiled sourly. ‘I expect Ronnie Vallance
thought up that line of argument. Apparently
his narcotics people have been having the devil of a
time with the traffic—trying to stop it getting a hold
on the teenagers as it has in America. Seems the dance
halls and the amusement arcades are full of pedlars.
Vallance’s Ghost Squad have managed to penetrate
back up the line to one of the middle-men, and there’s
no doubt it’s all coming from Italy, hidden in Italian
tourists’ cars. Vallance has done what he can through
the Italian police and Interpol, and got nowhere.
They get so far back up the pipeline, arrest a few little
people, and then, when they seem to be getting near
the centre, there’s a blank wall. The inner ring of distributors
are too frightened or too well paid.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond interrupted. ‘Perhaps there’s protection somewhere,
sir. That Montesi business didn’t look so
good.’</p>

<p class="pindent">M shrugged impatiently. ‘Maybe, maybe. And
you’ll have to watch out for that too, but my impression
is that the Montesi case resulted in a pretty
extensive clean-up. Anyway, when the P.M. gave me
the order to get on with it, it occurred to me to have
a talk with Washington. C.I.A. were very helpful.
You know the Narcotics Bureau have a team in Italy.
Have had ever since the War. They’re nothing to do
with C.I.A.—run by the American Treasury Department,
of all people. The American Treasury control a
so-called Secret Service that looks after drug smuggling
and counterfeiting. Pretty crazy arrangement. Often
wonder what the F.B.I. must think of it. However.’ M
slowly swivelled his chair away from the window. He
linked his hands behind his head and leaned back,
looking across the desk at Bond. ‘The point is that the
C.I.A. Rome Station works pretty closely with this
little narcotics team. Has to, to prevent crossed lines
and so on. And C.I.A.—Alan Dulles himself, as a
matter of fact—gave me the name of the top narcotics
agent used by the Bureau. Apparently he’s a
double. Does a little smuggling as cover. Chap called
Kristatos. Dulles said that of course he couldn’t involve
his people in any way and he was pretty certain
the Treasury Department wouldn’t welcome their
Rome Bureau playing too closely with us. But he said
that, if I wished, he would get word to this Kristatos
that one of our, er, best men would like to make
contact with a view to doing business. I said I would
much appreciate that, and yesterday I got word that
the rendezvous is fixed for the day after tomorrow.’
M gestured towards the files in front of Bond. ‘You’ll
find all the details in there.’</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a brief silence in the room. Bond was
thinking that the whole affair sounded unpleasant,
probably dangerous and certainly dirty. With the last
quality in mind, Bond got to his feet and picked up
the files. ‘All right, sir. It looks like money. How much
will we pay for the traffic to stop?’</p>

<p class="pindent">M let his chair tip forward. He put his hands flat
down on the desk, side by side. He said roughly: ‘A
hundred thousand pounds. In any currency. That’s the
P.M.’s figure. But I don’t want you to get hurt. Certainly
not picking other people’s coals out of the fire.
So you can go up to another hundred thousand if
there’s bad trouble. Drugs are the biggest and tightest
ring in crime.’ M reached for his in-basket and took
out a file of signals. Without looking up he said:
‘Look after yourself.’</p>

<hr class="tbk1"/>

<p class="pindent">Signor Kristatos picked up the menu. He said: ‘I do
not beat about bushes, Mr Bond. How much?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Fifty thousand pounds for one hundred per cent
results.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kristatos said indifferently: ‘Yes. Those are important
funds. I shall have melon with prosciutto ham
and a chocolate ice-cream. I do not eat greatly at
night. These people have their own Chianti. I commend
it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The waiter came and there was a brisk rattle of
Italian. Bond ordered Tagliatelli Verdi with a Genoese
sauce which Kristatos said was improbably concocted
of basil, garlic and fir-cones.</p>

<p class="pindent">When the waiter had gone, Kristatos sat and chewed
silently on a wooden toothpick. His face gradually became
dark and glum as if bad weather had come to
his mind. The black, hard eyes that glanced restlessly
at everything in the restaurant except Bond, glittered.
Bond guessed that Kristatos was wondering whether or
not to betray somebody. Bond said encouragingly: ‘In
certain circumstances, there might be more.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kristatos seemed to make up his mind. He said:
‘So?’ He pushed back his chair and got up. ‘Forgive
me. I must visit the toletta.’ He turned and walked
swiftly towards the back of the restaurant.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was suddenly hungry and thirsty. He poured
out a large glass of Chianti and swallowed half of it.
He broke a roll and began eating, smothering each
mouthful with deep yellow butter. He wondered why
rolls and butter are delicious only in France and Italy.
There was nothing else on his mind. It was just a
question of waiting. He had confidence in Kristatos.
He was a big, solid man who was trusted by the Americans.
He was probably making some telephone call
that would be decisive. Bond felt in good spirits. He
watched the passers-by through the plate-glass window.
A man selling one of the Party papers went by
on a bicycle. Flying from the basket in front of the
handle-bars was a pennant. In red on white it said:
<span class="calibre1">PROGRESSO?—SI! AVVENTURI?—NO!</span> Bond smiled.
That was how it was. Let it so remain for the rest of
the assignment.</p>

<hr class="tbk1"/>

<p class="pindent">On the far side of the square, rather plain room, at
the corner table by the <span class="it">caisse</span>, the plump fair-haired
girl with the dramatic mouth said to the jovial good-living
man with the thick rope of spaghetti joining his
face to his plate: ‘He has a rather cruel smile. But he
is very handsome. Spies aren’t usually so good-looking.
Are you sure you are right, mein Täubchen?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The man’s teeth cut through the rope. He wiped
his mouth on a napkin already streaked with tomato
sauce, belched sonorously and said: ‘Santos is never
wrong about these things. He has a nose for spies.
That is why I chose him as the permanent tail for that
bastard Kristatos. And who else but a spy would
think of spending an evening with the pig? But we
will make sure.’ The man took out of his pocket one of
those cheap tin snappers that are sometimes given out,
with paper hats and whistles, on carnival nights. It
gave one sharp click. The maître d’hôtel, on the far
side of the room, stopped whatever he was doing and
hurried over.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Si, padrone.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The man beckoned. The maître d’hôtel leant over
and received the whispered instructions. He nodded
briefly, walked over to a door near the kitchens marked
<span class="calibre1">UFFICIO</span>, and went in and closed the door behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Phase by phase, in a series of minute moves, an
exercise that had long been perfected was then
smoothly put into effect. The man near the <span class="it">caisse</span>
munched his spaghetti and critically observed each
step in the operation as if it had been a fast game of
chess.</p>

<p class="pindent">The maître d’hôtel came out of the door marked
<span class="calibre1">UFFICIO</span>, hurried across the restaurant and said loudly
to his No. 2: ‘An extra table for four. Immediately.’
The No. 2 gave him a direct look and nodded. He
followed the maître d’hôtel over to a space adjoining
Bond’s table, clicked his fingers for help, borrowed a
chair from one table, a chair from another table and,
with a bow and an apology, the spare chair from
Bond’s table. The fourth chair was being carried over
from the direction of the door marked <span class="calibre1">UFFICIO</span> by the
maître d’hôtel. He placed it square with the others, a
table was lowered into the middle and glass and cutlery
were deftly laid. The maître d’hôtel frowned.
‘But you have laid a table for four. I said three—for
three people.’ He casually took the chair he had himself
brought to the table and switched it to Bond’s
table. He gave a wave of the hand to dismiss his
helpers and everyone dispersed about their business.</p>

<p class="pindent">The innocent little flurry of restaurant movement
had taken about a minute. An innocuous trio of
Italians came into the restaurant. The maître d’hôtel
greeted them personally and bowed them to the new
table, and the gambit was completed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had hardly been conscious of it. Kristatos returned
from whatever business he had been about,
their food came and they got on with the meal.</p>

<p class="pindent">While they ate they talked about nothing—the
election chances in Italy, the latest Alfa Romeo,
Italian shoes compared with English. Kristatos talked
well. He seemed to know the inside story of everything.
He gave information so casually that it did not sound
like bluff. He spoke his own kind of English with an
occasional phrase borrowed from other languages. It
made a lively mixture. Bond was interested and
amused. Kristatos was a tough insider—a useful man.
Bond was not surprised that the American Intelligence
people found him good value.</p>

<p class="pindent">Coffee came. Kristatos lit a thin black cigar and
talked through it, the cigar jumping up and down
between the thin straight lips. He put both hands flat
on the table in front of him. He looked at the table-cloth
between them and said softly: ‘This pizniss. I
will play with you. To now I have only played with
the Americans. I have not told them what I am about
to tell you. There was no requirement. This machina
does not operate with America. These things are
closely regulated. This machina operates only with
England. Yes? Capito?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I understand. Everyone has his own territory. It’s
the usual way in these things.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Exact. Now, before I give you the informations,
like good commercials we make the terms. Yes?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Signor Kristatos examined the table-cloth more
closely. ‘I wish for ten thousand dollars American, in
paper of small sizes, by tomorrow lunch-time. When
you have destroyed the machina I wish for a further
twenty thousand.’ Signor Kristatos briefly raised his
eyes and surveyed Bond’s face. ‘I am not greedy. I do
not take all your funds, isn’t it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The price is satisfactory.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Bueno. Second term. There is no telling where you
get these informations from. Even if you are beaten.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Fair enough.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Third term. The head of this machina is a bad
man.’ Signor Kristatos paused and looked up. The
black eyes held a red glint. The clenched dry lips
pulled away from the cigar to let the words out. ‘He
is to be destrutto—killed.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat back. He gazed quizzically at the other
man who now leaned slightly forward over the table,
waiting. So the wheels had now shown within the
wheels! This was a private vendetta of some sort.
Kristatos wanted to get himself a gunman. And he was
not paying the gunman, the gunman was paying him
for the privilege of disposing of an enemy. Not bad!
The fixer was certainly working on a big fix this time—using
the Secret Service to pay off his private scores.
Bond said softly: ‘Why?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Signor Kristatos said indifferently: ‘No questions
catch no lies.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond drank down his coffee. It was the usual story
of big syndicate crime. You never saw more than the
tip of the iceberg. But what did that matter to him?
He had been sent to do one specific job. If his success
benefited others, nobody, least of all M, could care
less. Bond had been told to destroy the machine. If
this unnamed man was the machine, it would be
merely carrying out orders to destroy the man. Bond
said: ‘I cannot promise that. You must see that. All I
can say is that if the man tries to destroy me, I will
destroy him.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Signor Kristatos took a toothpick out of the holder,
stripped off the paper and set about cleaning his
finger-nails. When he had finished one hand he looked
up. He said: ‘I do not often gamble on incertitudes.
This time I will do so because it is you who are paying
me, and not me you. Is all right? So now I will give
you the informations. Then you are alone—solo.
Tomorrow night I fly to Karachi. I have important
pizniss there. I can only give you the informations.
After that you run with the ball and—’ he threw the
dirty toothpick down on the table—‘Che sara, sara.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Signor Kristatos edged his chair nearer to Bond.
He spoke softly and quickly. He gave specimen dates
and names to document his narrative. He never hesitated
for a fact and he did not waste time on irrelevant
detail. It was a short story and a pithy one. There were
two thousand American gangsters in the country—Italian-Americans
who had been convicted and expelled
from the United States. These men were in
a bad way. They were on the blackest of all police
lists and, because of their records, their own people
were wary of employing them. A hundred of the
toughest among them had pooled their funds and small
groups from this elite had moved to Beirut, Istanbul,
Tangier and Macao—the great smuggling centres of
the world. A further large section acted as couriers,
and the bosses had acquired, through nominees, a
small and respectable pharmaceutical business in
Milan. To this centre the outlying groups smuggled
opium and its derivatives. They used small craft across
the Mediterranean, a group of stewards in an Italian
charter airline and, as a regular weekly source of
supply, the through carriage of the Orient Express in
which whole sections of bogus upholstery were fitted
by bribed members of the train cleaners in Istanbul.
The Milan firm—Pharmacia Colomba S.A.—acted
as a clearing-house and as a convenient centre for
breaking down the raw opium into heroin. Thence the
couriers, using innocent motor-cars of various makes,
ran a delivery service to the middle-men in England.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond interrupted. ‘Our Customs are pretty good at
spotting that sort of traffic. There aren’t many hiding-places
in a car they don’t know about. Where do these
men carry the stuff?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Always in the spare wheel. You can carry twenty
thousand pounds worth of heroin in one spare wheel.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t they ever get caught—either bringing the
stuff in to Milan or taking it on?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Certainly. Many times. But these are well-trained
men. And they are tough. They never talk. If they are
convicted, they receive ten thousand dollars for each
year spent in prison. If they have families, they are cared
for. And when all goes well they make good money.
It is a co-operative. Each man receives his tranche of
the brutto. Only the chief gets a special tranche.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right. Well, who is this man?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Signor Kristatos put his hand up to the cheroot in
his mouth. He kept the hand there and spoke softly
from behind it. ‘Is a man they call “The Dove”, Enrico
Colombo. Is the padrone of this restaurant. That
is why I bring you here, so that you may see him. Is
the fat man who sits with a blonde woman. At the
table by the cassa. She is from Vienna. Her name is
Lisl Baum. A luxus whore.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said reflectively: ‘She is, is she?’ He did not
need to look. He had noticed the girl, as soon as he
had sat down at the table. Every man in the restaurant
would have noticed her. She had the gay, bold, forthcoming
looks the Viennese are supposed to have and
seldom do. There was a vivacity and a charm about
her that lit up her corner of the room. She had the
wildest possible urchin cut in ash-blonde, a pert nose,
a wide laughing mouth and a black ribbon round her
throat. James Bond knew that her eyes had been on
him at intervals throughout the evening. Her companion
had seemed just the type of rich, cheerful,
good-living man she would be glad to have as her
lover for a while. He would give her a good time. He
would be generous. There would be no regrets on
either side. On the whole, Bond had vaguely approved
of him. He liked cheerful, expansive people with a
zest for life. Since he, Bond, could not have the girl, it
was at least something that she was in good hands.
But now? Bond glanced across the room. The couple
were laughing about something. The man patted her
cheek and got up and went to the door marked
<span class="calibre1">UFFICIO</span> and went through and shut the door. So this
was the man who ran the great pipeline into England.
The man with M’s price of a hundred thousand pounds
on his head. The man Kristatos wanted Bond to kill.
Well, he had better get on with the job. Bond stared
rudely across the room at the girl. When she lifted her
head and looked at him, he smiled at her. Her eyes
swept past him, but there was a half smile, as if for
herself, on her lips, and when she took a cigarette out
of her case and lit it and blew the smoke straight up
towards the ceiling there was an offering of the throat
and the profile that Bond knew were for him.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was nearing the time for the after-cinema trade.
The maître d’hôtel was supervising the clearing of the
unoccupied tables and the setting up of new ones.
There was the usual bustle and slapping of napkins
across chair-seats and tinkle of glass and cutlery being
laid. Vaguely Bond noticed the spare chair at his table
being whisked away to help build up a near-by table
for six. He began asking Kristatos specific questions—the
personal habits of Enrico Colombo, where he lived,
the address of his firm in Milan, what other business
interests he had. He did not notice the casual progress
of the spare chair from its fresh table to another, and
then to another, and finally through the door marked
<span class="calibre1">UFFICIO</span>. There was no reason why he should.</p>

<hr class="tbk1"/>

<p class="pindent">When the chair was brought into his office, Enrico
Colombo waved the maître d’hôtel away and locked
the door behind him. Then he went to the chair and
lifted off the squab cushion and put it on his desk. He
unzipped one side of the cushion and withdrew a
Grundig tape-recorder, stopped the machine, ran the
tape back, took it off the recorder and put it on a playback
and adjusted the speed and volume. Then he sat
down at his desk and lit a cigarette and listened,
occasionally making further adjustments and occasionally
repeating passages. At the end, when Bond’s tinny
voice said ‘She is, is she?’ and there was a long silence
interspersed with background noises from the restaurant,
Enrico Colombo switched off the machine and
sat looking at it. He looked at it for a full minute. His
face showed nothing but acute concentration on his
thoughts. Then he looked away from the machine and
into nothing and said softly, out loud: ‘Son-a-beech.’
He got slowly to his feet and went to the door and
unlocked it. He looked back once more at the Grundig,
said ‘Son-a-beech’ again with more emphasis and
went out and back to his table.</p>

<p class="pindent">Enrico Colombo spoke swiftly and urgently to the
girl. She nodded and glanced across the room at Bond.
He and Kristatos were getting up from the table. She
said to Colombo in a low, angry voice: ‘You are a disgusting
man. Everybody said so and warned me
against you. They were right. Just because you give
me dinner in your lousy restaurant you think you have
the right to insult me with your filthy propositions’—the
girl’s voice had got louder. Now she had snatched
up her handbag and had got to her feet. She stood
beside the table directly in the line of Bond’s approach
on his way to the exit.</p>

<p class="pindent">Enrico Colombo’s face was black with rage. Now
he, too, was on his feet. ‘You goddam Austrian
beech——’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t dare insult my country, you Italian toad.’
She reached for a half-full glass of wine and hurled it
accurately in the man’s face. When he came at her it
was easy for her to back the few steps into Bond
who was standing with Kristatos politely waiting to
get by.</p>

<p class="pindent">Enrico Colombo stood panting, wiping the wine off
his face with a napkin. He said furiously to the girl:
‘Don’t ever show your face inside my restaurant again.’
He made the gesture of spitting on the floor between
them, turned and strode off through the door marked
<span class="calibre1">UFFICIO</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">The maître d’hôtel had hurried up. Everyone in the
restaurant had stopped eating. Bond took the girl by
the elbow. ‘May I help you find a taxi?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She jerked herself free. She said, still angry: ‘All
men are pigs.’ She remembered her manners. She
said stiffly: ‘You are very kind.’ She moved
haughtily towards the door with the men in her wake.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a buzz in the restaurant and a renewed
clatter of knives and forks. Everyone was delighted
with the scene. The maître d’hôtel, looking solemn,
held open the door. He said to Bond: ‘I apologize,
Monsieur. And you are very kind to be of assistance.’
A cruising taxi slowed. He beckoned it to the pavement
and held open the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl got in. Bond firmly followed and closed the
door. He said to Kristatos through the window: ‘I’ll
telephone you in the morning. All right?’ Without
waiting for the man’s reply he sat back in the seat.
The girl had drawn herself away into the farthest
corner. Bond said: ‘Where shall I tell him?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hotel Ambassadori.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They drove a short way in silence. Bond said:
‘Would you like to go somewhere first for a drink?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No thank you.’ She hesitated. ‘You are very kind,
but tonight I am tired.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Perhaps another night.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Perhaps, but I go to Venice tomorrow.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I shall also be there. Will you have dinner with me
tomorrow night?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl smiled. She said: ‘I thought Englishmen
were supposed to be shy. You are English, aren’t you?
What is your name? What do you do?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, I’m English. My name’s Bond—James Bond.
I write books—adventure stories. I’m writing one
now about drug smuggling. It’s set in Rome and
Venice. The trouble is that I don’t know enough about
the trade. I am going round picking up stories about
it. Do you know any?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So that is why you were having dinner with that
Kristatos. I know of him. He has a bad reputation. No.
I don’t know any stories. I only know what everybody
knows.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said enthusiastically: ‘But that’s exactly what
I want. When I said “stories” I didn’t mean fiction. I
meant the sort of high-level gossip that’s probably
pretty near the truth. That sort of thing’s worth
diamonds to a writer.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She laughed. ‘You mean that . . . diamonds?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said: ‘Well, I don’t earn all that as a writer,
but I’ve already sold an option on this story for a film,
and if I can make it authentic enough I daresay they’ll
actually buy the film.’ He reached out and put his
hand over hers in her lap. She did not take her hand
away. ‘Yes, diamonds. A diamond clip from Van
Cleef. Is it a deal?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Now she took her hand away. They were arriving at
the Ambassadori. She picked up her bag from the seat
beside her. She turned on the seat so that she faced
him. The commissionaire opened the door and the
light from the street turned her eyes into stars. She
examined his face with a certain seriousness. She said:
‘All men are pigs, but some are lesser pigs than others.
All right. I will meet you. But not for dinner. What I
may tell you is not for public places. I bathe every
afternoon at the Lido. But not at the fashionable
plage. I bathe at the Bagni Alberoni, where the English
poet Byron used to ride his horse. It is at the tip
of the peninsula. The Vaporetto will take you there.
You will find me there the day after tomorrow—at
three in the afternoon. I shall be getting my last sunburn
before the winter. Among the sand-dunes. You
will see a pale yellow umbrella. Underneath it will be
me.’ She smiled. ‘Knock on the umbrella and ask for
Fräulein Lisl Baum.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She got out of the taxi. Bond followed. She held out
her hand. ‘Thank you for coming to my rescue.
Good night.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said: ‘Three o’clock then. I shall be there.
Good night.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She turned and walked up the curved steps of the
hotel. Bond looked after her thoughtfully, and then
turned and got back into the taxi and told the man to
take him to the Nazionale. He sat back and watched
the neon signs ribbon past the window. Things, including
the taxi, were going almost too fast for comfort. The
only one over which he had any control was the taxi.
He leant forward and told the man to drive more slowly.</p>

<hr class="tbk1"/>

<p class="pindent">The best train from Rome to Venice is the Laguna
express that leaves every day at midday. Bond, after a
morning that was chiefly occupied with difficult talks
with his London Headquarters on Station I’s
scrambler, caught it by the skin of his teeth. The Laguna
is a smart, streamlined affair that looks and
sounds more luxurious than it is. The seats are made
for small Italians and the restaurant car staff suffer
from the disease that afflicts their brethren in the
great trains all over the world—a genuine loathing
for the modern traveller and particularly for the
foreigner. Bond had a gangway seat over the axle in
the rear aluminium coach. If the seven heavens had
been flowing by outside the window he would not
have cared. He kept his eyes inside the train, read a
jerking book, spilled Chianti over the table-cloth and
shifted his long, aching legs and cursed the Ferrovie
Italiane dello Stato.</p>

<p class="pindent">But at last there was Mestre and the dead straight
finger of rail across the eighteenth-century aquatint
into Venice. Then came the unfailing shock of the
beauty that never betrays and the soft swaying progress
down the Grand Canal into a blood-red sunset,
and the extreme pleasure—so it seemed—of the
Gritti Palace that Bond should have ordered the best
double room on the first floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">That evening, scattering thousand-lira notes like
leaves in Vallombrosa, James Bond sought, at Harry’s
Bar, at Florian’s, and finally upstairs in the admirable
Quadri, to establish to anyone who might be interested
that he was what he had wished to appear to the girl—a
prosperous writer who lived high and well. Then,
in the temporary state of euphoria that a first night in
Venice engenders, however high and serious the purpose
of the visitor, James Bond walked back to the
Gritti and had eight hours dreamless sleep.</p>

<p class="pindent">May and October are the best months in Venice.
The sun is soft and the nights are cool. The glittering
scene is kinder to the eyes and there is a freshness in
the air that helps one to hammer out those long miles
of stone and terrazza and marble that are intolerable
to the feet in summer. And there are fewer people.
Although Venice is the one town in the world that can
swallow up a hundred thousand tourists as easily as it
can a thousand—hiding them down its side-streets,
using them for crowd scenes on the piazzas, stuffing
them into the vaporetti—it is still better to share
Venice with the minimum number of packaged tours
and Lederhosen.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond spent the next morning strolling the back-streets
in the hope that he would be able to uncover a
tail. He visited a couple of churches—not to admire
their interiors but to discover if anyone came in after
him through the main entrance before he left by the
side door. No one was following him. Bond went to
Florian’s and had an Americano and listened to a
couple of French culture-snobs discussing the imbalance
of the containing façade of St Mark’s Square.
On an impulse, he bought a postcard and sent it off
to his secretary who had once been with the Georgian
Group to Italy and had never allowed Bond to forget
it. He wrote: ‘Venice is wonderful. Have so far inspected
the railway station and the Stock Exchange.
Very aesthetically satisfying. To the Municipal Waterworks
this afternoon and then an old Brigitte Bardot at
the Scala Cinema. Do you know a wonderful tune
called “O Sole Mio”? It’s v. romantic like everything
here. JB.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Pleased with his inspiration, Bond had an early
luncheon and went back to his hotel. He locked the
door of his room and took off his coat and ran over the
Walther PPK. He put up the safe and practised
one or two quick draws and put the gun back in the
holster. It was time to go. He went along to the landing-stage
and boarded the twelve-forty vaporetto to
Alberoni, out of sight across the mirrored lagoons.
Then he settled down in a seat in the bows and wondered
what was going to happen to him.</p>

<hr class="tbk1"/>

<p class="pindent">From the jetty at Alberoni, on the Venice side of the
Lido peninsula, there is a half-mile dusty walk across
the neck of land to the Bagni Alberoni facing the
Adriatic. It is a curiously deserted world, this tip of
the famous peninsula. A mile down the thin neck of
land the luxury real estate development has petered
out in a scattering of cracked stucco villas and bankrupt
housing projects, and here there is nothing but
the tiny fishing village of Alberoni, a sanatorium for
students, a derelict experimental station belonging to
the Italian Navy and some massive weed-choked gun
emplacements from the last war. In the no man’s land
in the centre of this thin tongue of land is the Golf du
Lido, whose brownish undulating fairways meander
around the ruins of ancient fortifications. Not many
people come to Venice to play golf, and the project is
kept alive for its snob appeal by the grand hotels of the
Lido. The golf-course is surrounded by a high wire
fence hung at intervals, as if it protected something of
great value or secrecy, with threatening Vietatos and
Prohibitos. Around this wired enclave, the scrub and
sand-hills have not even been cleared of mines, and
amongst the rusting barbed wire are signs saying
<span class="calibre1">MINAS. PERICOLO DI MORTE</span> beneath a roughly stencilled
skull and cross-bones. The whole area is strange
and melancholy and in extraordinary contrast to the
gay carnival world of Venice less than an hour away
across the lagoons.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was sweating slightly by the time he had
walked the half-mile across the peninsula to the plage,
and he stood for a moment under the last of the acacia
trees that had bordered the dusty road to cool off
while he got his bearings. In front of him was a rickety
wooden archway whose central span said <span class="calibre1">BAGNI
ALBERONI</span> in faded blue paint. Beyond were the lines of
equally dilapidated wooden cabins, and then a hundred
yards of sand and then the quiet blue glass of the
sea. There were no bathers and the place seemed to be
closed, but when he walked through the archway he
heard the tinny sound of a radio playing Neapolitan
music. It came from a ramshackle hut that advertised
Coca-Cola and various Italian soft drinks. Deckchairs
were stacked against its walls and there were
two pedallos and a child’s half-inflated sea-horse. The
whole establishment looked so derelict that Bond
could not imagine it doing business even at the height
of the summer season. He stepped off the narrow
duck-boards into the soft, burned sand and moved
round behind the huts to the beach. He walked down
to the edge of the sea. To the left, until it disappeared
in the autumn heat haze, the wide empty sand swept
away in a slight curve towards the Lido proper. To
the right was half a mile of beach terminating in the
sea-wall at the tip of the peninsula. The sea-wall
stretched like a finger out into the silent mirrored sea,
and at intervals along its top were the flimsy derricks
of the octopus fishermen. Behind the beach were the
sand-hills and a section of the wire fence surrounding
the golf-course. On the edge of the sand-hills, perhaps
five hundred yards away, there was a speck of bright
yellow.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond set off towards it along the tide-line.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ahem.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The hands flew to the top scrap of bikini and pulled
it up. Bond walked into her line of vision and stood
looking down. The bright shadow of the umbrella
covered only her face. The rest of her—a burned
cream body in a black bikini on a black and white
striped bath-towel—lay offered to the sun.</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked up at him through half-closed eyelashes.
‘You are five minutes early and I told you to knock.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat down close to her in the shade of the big
umbrella. He took out a handkerchief and wiped his
face. ‘You happen to own the only palm tree in the
whole of this desert. I had to get underneath it as soon
as I could. This is the hell of a place for a rendezvous.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She laughed. ‘I am like Greta Garbo. I like to be
alone.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Are we alone?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She opened her eyes wide. ‘Why not? You think I
have brought a chaperone?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Since you think all man are pigs . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ah, but you are a gentleman pig,’ she giggled. ‘A
milord pig. And anyway, it is too hot for that kind of
thing. And there is too much sand. And besides this is
a business meeting, no? I tell you stories about drugs
and you give me a diamond clip. From Van Cleef. Or
have you changed your mind?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No. That’s how it is. Where shall we begin?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You ask the questions. What is it you want to
know?’ She sat up and pulled her knees to her between
her arms. Flirtation had gone out of her eyes
and they had become attentive, and perhaps a little
careful.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond noticed the change. He said casually, watching
her: ‘They say your friend Colombo is a big man
in the game. Tell me about him. He would make a
good character for my book—disguised, of course.
But it’s the detail I need. How does he operate,
and so on? That’s not the sort of thing a writer can
invent.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She veiled her eyes. She said: ‘Enrico would be very
angry if he knew that I had told any of his secrets. I
don’t know what he would do to me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He will never know.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked at him seriously. ‘Lieber Mr Bond, there
is very little that he does not know. And he is also quite
capable of acting on a guess. I would not be surprised’—Bond
caught her quick glance at his watch—‘if it
had crossed his mind to have me followed here. He is a
very suspicious man.’ She put her hand out and
touched his sleeve. Now she looked nervous. She said
urgently: ‘I think you had better go now. This has
been a great mistake.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond openly looked at his watch. It was three-thirty.
He moved his head so that he could look behind
the umbrella and back down the beach. Far down by
the bathing-huts, their outlines dancing slightly in the
heat haze, were three men in dark clothes. They were
walking purposefully up the beach, their feet keeping
step as if they were a squad.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got to his feet. He looked down at the bent
head. He said drily: ‘I see what you mean. Just tell
Colombo that from now on I’m writing his life-story.
And I’m a very persistent writer. So long.’ Bond
started running up the sand towards the tip of the
peninsula. From there he could double back down the
other shore to the village and the safety of people.</p>

<p class="pindent">Down the beach the three men broke into a fast jog-trot,
elbows and legs pounding in time with each
other as if they were long-distance runners out for a
training spin. As they jogged past the girl, one of the
men raised a hand. She raised hers in answer and then
lay down on the sand and turned over—perhaps so
that her back could now get its toasting, or perhaps
because she did not want to watch the man-hunt.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took off his tie as he ran and put it in his
pocket. It was very hot and he was already sweating
profusely. But so would the three men be. It was a
question who was in better training. At the tip of the
peninsula, Bond clambered up on to the sea-wall and
looked back. The men had hardly gained, but now
two of them were fanning out to cut round the edge of
the golf-course boundary. They did not seem to mind
the danger notices with the skulls and cross-bones.
Bond, running fast down the wide sea-wall, measured
angles and distances. The two men were cutting
across the base of the triangle. It was going to be a
close call.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s shirt was already soaked and his feet were
beginning to hurt. He had run perhaps a mile. How
much farther to safety? At intervals along the sea-wall
the breeches of antique cannon had been sunk in the
concrete. They would be mooring-posts for the fishing-fleets
sheltering in the protection of the lagoons before
taking to the Adriatic. Bond counted his steps between
two of them. Fifty yards. How many black knobs to
the end of the wall—to the first houses of the village?
Bond counted up to thirty before the line vanished
into the heat haze. Probably another mile to go.
Could he do it, and fast enough to beat the two flankers?
Bond’s breath was already rasping in his throat.
Now even his suit was soaked with sweat and the cloth
of his trousers was chafing his legs. Behind him, three
hundred yards back, was one pursuer. To his right,
dodging among the sand-dunes and converging fast,
were the other two. To his left was a twenty-foot slope
of masonry to the green tide ripping out into the
Adriatic.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was planning to slow down to a walk and keep
enough breath to try and shoot it out with the three
men, when two things happened in quick succession.
First he saw through the haze ahead a group of spear-fishermen.
There were about half a dozen of them,
some in the water and some sunning themselves on the
sea-wall. Then, from the sand-dunes came the deep
roar of an explosion. Earth and scrub and what might
have been bits of a man fountained briefly into the
air, and a small shock-wave hit him. Bond slowed.
The other man in the dunes had stopped. He was
standing stock-still. His mouth was open and a
frightened jabber came from it. Suddenly he collapsed
on the ground with his arms wrapped round his head.
Bond knew the signs. He would not move again until
someone came and carried him away from there.
Bond’s heart lifted. Now he had only about two hundred
yards to go to the fishermen. They were already
gathering into a group, looking towards him. Bond
summoned a few words of Italian and rehearsed them.
‘Mi Ingles. Prego, dove il carabinieri.’ Bond glanced
over his shoulder. Odd, but despite the witnessing
spear-fishers, the man was still coming on. He had
gained and was only about a hundred yards behind.
There was a gun in his hand. Now, ahead, the fishermen
had fanned out across Bond’s path. They had
harpoon guns held at the ready. In the centre was a
big man with a tiny red bathing-slip hanging beneath
his stomach. A green mask was slipped back on to the
crown of his head. He stood with his blue swim-fins
pointing out and his arms akimbo. He looked like
Mr Toad of Toad Hall in Technicolor. Bond’s amused
thought died in him stillborn. Panting, he slowed to a
walk. Automatically his sweaty hand felt under his
coat for the gun and drew it out. The man in the
centre of the arc of pointing harpoons was Enrico
Colombo.</p>

<p class="pindent">Colombo watched him approach. When he was
twenty yards away, Colombo said quietly: ‘Put away
your toy, Mr Bond of the Secret Service. These are
CO<sub class="calibre12">2</sub> harpoon guns. And stay where you are. Unless
you wish to make a copy of Mantegna’s St Sebastian.’
He turned to the man on his right. He spoke in English.
‘At what range was that Albanian last week?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Twenty yards, padrone. And the harpoon went
right through. But he was a fat man—perhaps twice
as thick as this one.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stopped. One of the iron bollards was beside
him. He sat down and rested the gun on his knee. It
pointed at the centre of Colombo’s big stomach. He
said: ‘Five harpoons in me won’t stop one bullet in
you, Colombo.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colombo smiled and nodded, and the man who
had been coming softly up behind Bond hit him once
hard in the base of the skull with the butt of his Luger.</p>

<hr class="tbk1"/>

<p class="pindent">When you come to from being hit on the head the
first reaction is a fit of vomiting. Even in his wretchedness
Bond was aware of two sensations—he was in a
ship at sea, and someone, a man, was wiping his forehead
with a cool wet towel and murmuring encouragement
in bad English. ‘Is okay, amigo. Take him easy.
Take him easy.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond fell back on his bunk, exhausted. It was a
comfortable small cabin with a feminine smell and
dainty curtains and colours. A sailor in a tattered vest
and trousers—Bond thought he recognized him as
one of the spear-fishermen—was bending over him.
He smiled when Bond opened his eyes. ‘Is better, yes?
Subito okay.’ He rubbed the back of his neck in sympathy.
‘It hurts for a little. Soon it will only be a
black. Beneath the hair. The girls will see nothing.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled feebly and nodded. The pain of the
nod made him screw up his eyes. When he opened
them the sailor shook his head in admonition. He
brought his wrist-watch close up to Bond’s eyes. It
said seven o’clock. He pointed with his little finger at
the figure nine. ‘Mangiare con Padrone, Si?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said: ‘Si.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The man put his hand to his cheek and laid his head
on one side. ‘Dormire.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said ‘Si’ again and the sailor went out of the
cabin and closed the door without locking it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got gingerly off the bunk and went over to the
wash-basin and set about cleaning himself. On top
of the chest of drawers was a neat pile of his personal
belongings. Everything was there except his gun.
Bond stowed the things away in his pockets, and sat
down again on the bunk and smoked and thought.
His thoughts were totally inconclusive. He was being
taken for a ride, or rather a sail, but from the behaviour
of the sailor it did not seem that he was regarded
as an enemy. Yet a great deal of trouble had
been taken to make him prisoner and one of Colombo’s
men had even, though inadvertently, died in the process.
It did not seem to be just a question of killing
him. Perhaps this soft treatment was the preliminary
to trying to make a deal with him. What was the
deal—and what was the alternative?</p>

<p class="pindent">At nine o’clock the same sailor came for Bond and
led him down a short passage to a small, blowzy saloon,
and left him. There was a table and two chairs in the
middle of the room, and beside the table a nickel-plated
trolley laden with food and drinks. Bond tried
the hatchway at the end of the saloon. It was bolted.
He unlatched one of the portholes and looked out.
There was just enough light to see that the ship was
about two hundred tons and might once have been a
large fishing-vessel. The engine sounded like a single
diesel and they were carrying sail. Bond estimated the
ship’s speed at six or seven knots. On the dark horizon
there was a tiny cluster of yellow lights. It seemed
probable that they were sailing down the Adriatic
coast.</p>

<p class="pindent">The hatchway bolt rattled back. Bond pulled in his
head. Colombo came down the steps. He was dressed
in a sweat-shirt, dungarees and scuffed sandals. There
was a wicked, amused gleam in his eyes. He sat down
in one chair and waved to the other. ‘Come, my
friend. Food and drink and plenty of talk. We will
now stop behaving like little boys and be grown-up.
Yes? What will you have—gin, whisky, champagne?
And this is the finest sausage in the whole of Bologna.
Olives from my own estate. Bread, butter, Provolone—that
is smoked cheese—and fresh figs. Peasant
food, but good. Come. All that running must have
given you an appetite.’</p>

<p class="pindent">His laugh was infectious. Bond poured himself a
stiff whisky and soda, and sat down. He said: ‘Why
did you have to go to so much trouble? We could have
met without all these dramatics. As it is you have prepared
a lot of grief for yourself. I warned my chief that
something like this might happen—the way the girl
picked me up in your restaurant was too childish for
words. I said that I would walk into the trap to see
what it was all about. If I am not out of it again
by tomorrow midday, you’ll have Interpol as
well as the Italian police on top of you like a load of
bricks.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colombo looked puzzled. He said: ‘If you were
ready to walk into the trap, why did you try and
escape from my men this afternoon? I had sent them
to fetch you and bring you to my ship, and it would
all have been much more friendly. Now I have lost a
good man and you might easily have had your skull
broken. I do not understand.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I didn’t like the look of those three men. I know
killers when I see them. I thought you might be thinking
of doing something stupid. You should have used
the girl. The men were unnecessary.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colombo shook his head. ‘Lisl was willing to find
out more about you, but nothing else. She will now be
just as angry with me as you are. Life is very difficult.
I like to be friends with everyone, and now I have
made two enemies in one afternoon. It is too bad.”
Colombo looked genuinely sorry for himself. He cut
a thick slice of sausage, impatiently tore the rind off it
with his teeth and began to eat. While his mouth was
still full he took a glass of champagne and washed the
sausage down with it. He said, shaking his head reproachfully
at Bond: ‘It is always the same, when I am
worried I have to eat. But the food that I eat when I
am worried I cannot digest. And now you have worried
me. You say that we could have met and talked
things over—that I need not have taken all this
trouble.’ He spread his hands helplessly. ‘How was I
to know that? By saying that, you put the blood of
Mario on my hands. I did not tell him to take a short
cut through that place.’ Colombo pounded the table.
Now he shouted angrily at Bond. ‘I do not agree that
this was all my fault. It was your fault. Yours only.
You had agreed to kill me. How does one arrange a
friendly meeting with one’s murderer? Eh? Just tell
me that.’ Colombo snatched up a long roll of bread
and stuffed it into his mouth, his eyes furious.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What the hell are you talking about?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colombo threw the remains of the roll on the table
and got to his feet, holding Bond’s eyes locked in his.
He walked sideways, still gazing fixedly at Bond, to a
chest of drawers, felt for the knob of the top drawer,
opened it, groped and lifted out what Bond recognized
as a tape-recorder playback machine. Still looking
accusingly at Bond, he brought the machine over to
the table. He sat down and pressed a switch.</p>

<p class="pindent">When Bond heard the voice he picked up his glass
of whisky and looked into it. The tinny voice said:
‘Exact. Now, before I give you the informations, like
good commercials we make the terms. Yes?’ The voice
went on: ‘Ten thousand dollars American . . . There
is no telling where you get these informations from.
Even if you are beaten . . . The head of this machina
is a bad man. He is to be destrutto—killed.’ Bond
waited for his own voice to break through the restaurant
noises. There had been a long pause while he
thought about the last condition. What was it he had
said? His voice came out of the machine, answering
him. ‘I cannot promise that. You must see that. All I
can say is that if the man tries to destroy me, I will
destroy him.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colombo switched off the machine. Bond swallowed
down his whisky. Now he could look up at Colombo.
He said defensively: ‘That doesn’t make me a
murderer.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colombo looked at him sorrowfully. ‘To me it does.
Coming from an Englishman. I worked for the English
during the War. In the Resistance. I have the
King’s Medal.’ He put his hand in his pocket and
threw the silver Freedom medal with the red, white
and blue striped ribbon on to the table. ‘You see?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond obstinately held Colombo’s eyes. He said:
‘And the rest of the stuff on that tape? You long ago
stopped working for the English. Now you work
against them, for money.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colombo grunted. He tapped the machine with his
forefinger. He said impassively: ‘I have heard it all.
It is lies.’ He banged his fist on the table so that the
glasses jumped. He bellowed furiously: ‘It is lies, lies.
Every word of it.’ He jumped to his feet. His chair
crashed down behind him. He slowly bent and picked
it up. He reached for the whisky bottle and walked
round and poured four fingers into Bond’s glass. He
went back to his chair and sat down and put the
champagne bottle on the table in front of him. Now
his face was composed, serious. He said quietly: ‘It is
not all lies. There is a grain of truth in what that
bastard told you. That is why I decided not to argue
with you. You might not have believed me. You
would have dragged in the police. There would have
been much trouble for me and my comrades. Even if
you or someone else had not found reason to kill me,
there would have been scandal, ruin. Instead I decided
to show you the truth—the truth you were sent to
Italy to find out. Within a matter of hours, tomorrow
at dawn, your mission will have been completed.’
Colombo clicked his fingers. ‘Presto—like that.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said: ‘What part of Kristatos’s story is not
lies?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colombo’s eyes looked into Bond’s, calculating.
Finally he said: ‘My friend, I am a smuggler. That
part is true. I am probably the most successful smuggler
in the Mediterranean. Half the American cigarettes
in Italy are brought in by me from Tangier.
Gold? I am the sole supplier of the black valuta
market. Diamonds? I have my own purveyor in
Beirut with direct lines to Sierra Leone and South
Africa. In the old days, when these things were scarce,
I also handled aureomycin and penicillin and such
medicines. Bribery at the American base hospitals. And
there have been many other things—even beautiful
girls from Syria and Persia for the houses of Naples.
I have also smuggled out escaped convicts. But,’
Colombo’s fist crashed on the table, ‘drugs, heroin,
opium, hemp—no! Never! I will have nothing to do
with these things. These things are evil. There is no
sin in the others.’ Colombo held up his right hand.
‘My friend, this I swear to you on the head of my
mother.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was beginning to see daylight. He was prepared
to believe Colombo. He even felt a curious liking
for this greedy, boisterous pirate who had so nearly
been put on the spot by Kristatos. Bond said: ‘But why
did Kristatos put the finger on you? What’s he got to
gain?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colombo slowly shook a finger to and fro in front of
his nose. He said: ‘My friend, Kristatos is Kristatos.
He is playing the biggest double game it is possible to
conceive. To keep it up—to keep the protection of
American Intelligence and their Narcotics people—he
must now and then throw them a victim—some small
man on the fringe of the big game. But with this English
problem it is different. That is a huge traffic. To
protect it, a big victim was required. I was chosen—by
Kristatos, or by his employers. And it is true that if
you had been vigorous in your investigations and had
spent enough hard currency on buying information,
you might have discovered the story of my operations.
But each trail towards <span class="it">me</span> would have led you further
away from the truth. In the end, for I do not underestimate
your Service, I would have gone to prison.
But the big fox you are after would only be laughing
at the sound of the hunt dying away in the distance.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Why did Kristatos want you killed?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colombo looked cunning. ‘My friend, I know too
much. In the fraternity of smugglers, we occasionally
stumble on a corner of the next man’s business. Not
long ago, in this ship, I had a running fight with a
small gunboat from Albania. A lucky shot set fire to
their fuel. There was only one survivor. He was persuaded
to talk. I learnt much, but like a fool I took a
chance with the minefields and set him ashore on the
coast north of Tirana. It was a mistake. Ever since
then I have had this bastard Kristatos after me.
Fortunately,’ Colombo grinned wolfishly, ‘I have one
piece of information he does not know of. And we
have a rendezvous with this piece of information at
first light tomorrow—at a small fishing-port just
north of Ancona, Santa Maria. And there,’ Colombo
gave a harsh, cruel laugh, ‘we shall see what we shall
see.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said mildly: ‘What’s your price for all this?
You say my mission will have been completed tomorrow
morning. How much?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colombo shook his head. He said indifferently:
‘Nothing. It just happens that our interests coincide.
But I shall need your promise that what I have told
you this evening is between you and me and, if necessary,
your Chief in London. It must never come back
to Italy. Is that agreed?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes. I agree to that.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colombo got to his feet. He went to the chest of
drawers and took out Bond’s gun. He handed it to
Bond. ‘In that case, my friend, you had better have
this, because you are going to need it. And you had
better get some sleep. There will be rum and coffee
for everyone at five in the morning.’ He held out his
hand. Bond took it. Suddenly the two men were
friends. Bond felt the fact. He said awkwardly ‘All
right, Colombo,’ and went out of the saloon and along
to his cabin.</p>

<hr class="tbk1"/>

<p class="pindent">The <span class="it">Colombina</span> had a crew of twelve. They were
youngish, tough-looking men. They talked softly
among themselves as the mugs of hot coffee and rum
were dished out by Colombo in the saloon. A storm
lantern was the only light—the ship had been darkened—and
Bond smiled to himself at the Treasure
Island atmosphere of excitement and conspiracy.
Colombo went from man to man on a weapon inspection.
They all had Lugers, carried under the jersey inside
the trouser-band, and flick-knives in the pocket.
Colombo had a word of approval or criticism for each
weapon. It struck Bond that Colombo had made a
good life for himself—a life of adventure and thrill
and risk. It was a criminal life—a running fight with
the currency laws, the State tobacco monopoly, the
Customs, the police—but there was a whiff of adolescent
rascality in the air which somehow changed the
colour of the crime from black to white—or at least
to grey.</p>

<p class="pindent">Colombo looked at his watch. He dismissed the men
to their posts. He dowsed the lantern and, in the oyster
light of dawn, Bond followed him up to the bridge. He
found the ship was close to a black, rocky shore
which they were following at reduced speed. Colombo
pointed ahead. ‘Round that headland is the harbour.
Our approach will not have been observed. In the
harbour, against the jetty, I expect to find a ship of
about this size unloading innocent rolls of newsprint
down a ramp into a warehouse. Round the headland,
we will put on full speed and come alongside this ship
and board her. There will be resistance. Heads will
be broken. I hope it is not shooting. We shall not shoot
unless they do. But it will be an Albanian ship manned
by a crew of Albanian toughs. If there is shooting, you
must shoot well with the rest of us. These people are
enemies of your country as well as mine. If you get
killed, you get killed. Okay?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s all right.’</p>

<p class="pindent">As Bond said the words, there came a ting on the
engine-room telegraph and the deck began to tremble
under his feet. Making ten knots, the small ship
rounded the headland into the harbour.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was as Colombo had said. Alongside a stone jetty
lay the ship, its sails flapping idly. From her stern a
ramp of wooden planks sloped down towards the dark
mouth of a ramshackle corrugated iron warehouse, inside
which burned feeble electric lights. The ship carried
a deck cargo of what appeared to be rolls of newsprint,
and these were being hoisted one by one on to
the ramp whence they rolled down under their own
momentum through the mouth of the warehouse.
There were about twenty men in sight. Only surprise
would straighten out these odds. Now Colombo’s craft
was fifty yards away from the other ship, and one or
two of the men had stopped working and were looking
in their direction. One man ran off into the warehouse.
Simultaneously Colombo issued a sharp order.
The engines stopped and went into reverse. A big
searchlight on the bridge came on and lit the whole
scene brightly as the ship drifted up alongside the
Albanian trawler. At the first hard contact, grappling-irons
were tossed over the Albanian’s rail fore and aft,
and Colombo’s men swarmed over the side with
Colombo in the lead.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had made his own plans. As soon as his feet
landed on the enemy deck, he ran straight across the
ship, climbed the far rail and jumped. It was about
twelve feet to the jetty and he landed like a cat, on his
hands and toes, and stayed for a moment, crouching,
planning his next move. Shooting had already started
on deck. An early shot killed the searchlight and now
there was only the grey, luminous light of dawn. A
body, one of the enemy, crunched to the stone in front
of him and lay spread-eagled, motionless. At the same
time, from the mouth of the warehouse, a light
machine-gun started up, firing short bursts with a
highly professional touch. Bond ran towards it in the
dark shadow of the ship. The machine-gunner saw
him and gave him a burst. The bullets zipped round
Bond, clanged against the iron hull of the ship and
whined off into the night. Bond got to the cover of the
sloping ramp of boards and dived forward on his stomach.
The bullets crashed into the wood above his head.
Bond crept forward into the narrowing space. When
he had got as close as he could, he would have a
choice of breaking cover either to right or left of the
boards. There came a series of heavy thuds and a
swift rumble above his head. One of Colombo’s men
must have cut the ropes and sent the whole pile of
newsprint rolls down the ramp. Now was Bond’s
chance. He leapt out from under cover—to the left.
If the machine-gunner was waiting for him, he would
expect Bond to come out firing on the right. The
machine-gunner was there, crouching up against the
wall of the warehouse. Bond fired twice in the split
second before the bright muzzle of the enemy weapon
had swung through its small arc. The dead man’s
finger clenched on the trigger and, as he slumped, his
gun made a brief Catherine-wheel of flashes before it
shook itself free from his hand and clattered to the
ground.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was running forward towards the warehouse
door when he slipped and fell headlong. He lay for a
moment, stunned, his face in a pool of black treacle.
He cursed and got to his hands and knees and made
a dash for cover behind a jumble of the big newsprint
rolls that had crashed into the wall of the warehouse.
One of them, sliced by a burst from the machine-gun,
was leaking black treacle. Bond wiped as much of the
stuff off his hands and face as he could. It had the
musty sweet smell that Bond had once smelled in
Mexico. It was raw opium.</p>

<p class="pindent">A bullet whanged into the wall of the warehouse
not far from his head. Bond gave his gun-hand a last
wipe on the seat of his trousers and leapt for the warehouse
door. He was surprised not to be shot at from
the interior as soon as he was silhouetted against the
entrance. It was quiet and cool inside the place. The
lights had been turned out, but it was now getting
brighter outside. The pale newsprint rolls were
stacked in orderly ranks with a space to make a passage-way
down the centre. At the far end of the passage-way
was a door. The whole arrangement leered
at him, daring him. Bond smelled death. He edged
back to the entrance and out into the open. The
shooting had become spasmodic. Colombo came
running swiftly towards him, his feet close to the
ground as fat men run. Bond said peremptorily: ‘Stay
at this door. Don’t go in or let any of your men in. I’m
going round to the back.’ Without waiting for an answer
he sprinted round the corner of the building and
down along its side.</p>

<p class="pindent">The warehouse was about fifty feet long. Bond
slowed and walked softly to the far corner. He flattened
himself against the corrugated iron wall and took a
swift look round. He immediately drew back. A man
was standing up against the back entrance. His eyes
were at some kind of a spyhole. In his hand was a
plunger from which wires ran under the bottom of the
door. A car, a black Lancia Granturismo convertible
with the hood down, stood beside him, its engine ticking
over softly. It pointed inland along a deeply
tracked dust road.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man was Kristatos.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond knelt. He held his gun in both hands for
steadiness, inched swiftly round the corner of the
building and fired one shot at the man’s feet. He
missed. Almost as he saw the dust kick up inches off
the target, there was the rumbling crack of an explosion
and the tin wall hit him and sent him flying.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond scrambled to his feet. The warehouse had
buckled crazily out of shape. Now it started to collapse
noisily like a pack of tin cards. Kristatos was in the car.
It was already twenty yards away, dust fountaining
up from the traction on the rear wheels. Bond stood in
the classic pistol-shooting pose and took careful aim.
The Walther roared and kicked three times. At the
last shot, at fifty yards, the figure crouched over the
wheel jerked backwards. The hands flew sideways off
the wheel. The head craned briefly into the air and
slumped forward. The right hand remained sticking
out as if the dead man was signalling a right-hand turn.
Bond started to run up the road, expecting the car to
stop, but the wheels were held in the ruts and, with the
weight of the dead right foot still on the accelerator,
the Lancia tore onwards in its screaming third gear.
Bond stopped and watched it. It hurried on along the
flat road across the burned-up plain and the cloud
of white dust blew gaily up behind. At any moment
Bond expected it to veer off the road, but it did not,
and Bond stood and saw it out of sight into the early
morning mist that promised a beautiful day.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond put his gun on safe and tucked it away in the
belt of his trousers. He turned to find Colombo approaching
him. The fat man was grinning delightedly.
He came up with Bond and, to Bond’s horror, threw
open his arms, clutched Bond to him and kissed him
on both cheeks.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said: ‘For God’s sake, Colombo.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colombo roared with laughter. ‘Ah, the quiet Englishman!
He fears nothing save the emotions. But me,’
he hit himself in the chest, ‘me, Enrico Colombo,
loves this man and he is not ashamed to say so. If you
had not got the machine-gunner, not one of us would
have survived. As it is, I lost two of my men and others
have wounds. But only half a dozen Albanians remain
on their feet and they have escaped into the village.
No doubt the police will round them up. And now
you have sent that bastard Kristatos motoring down
to hell. What a splendid finish to him! What will happen
when the little racing-hearse meets the main
road? He is already signalling for the right-hand turn
on to the autostrada. I hope he will remember to
drive on the right.’ Colombo clapped Bond boisterously
on the shoulder. ‘But come, my friend. It is time
we got out of here. The cocks are open in the Albanian
ship and she will soon be on the bottom. There are no
telephones in this little place. We will have a good
start on the police. It will take them some time to get
sense out of the fishermen. I have spoken to the head
man. No one here has any love for Albanians. But we
must be on our way. We have a stiff sail into the wind
and there is no doctor I can trust this side of Venice.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Flames were beginning to lick out of the shattered
warehouse, and there was billowing smoke that smelled
of sweet vegetables. Bond and Colombo walked
round to windward. The Albanian ship had settled
on the bottom and her decks were awash. They waded
across her and climbed on board the <span class="it">Colombina</span>, where
Bond had to go through some more handshaking and
backslapping. They cast off at once and made for the
headland guarding the harbour. There was a small
group of fishermen standing by their boats that lay
drawn up on the beach below a huddle of stone cottages.
They made a surly impression, but when
Colombo waved and shouted something in Italian
most of them raised a hand in farewell, and one of
them called back something that made the crew of the
<span class="it">Colombina</span> laugh. Colombo explained: ‘They say we
were better than the cinema at Ancona and we must
come again soon.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond suddenly felt the excitement drain out of him.
He felt dirty and unshaven, and he could smell his own
sweat. He went below and borrowed a razor and a
clean shirt from one of the crew, and stripped in his
cabin and cleaned himself. When he took out his gun
and threw it on the bunk he caught a whiff of cordite
from the barrel. It brought back the fear and violence
and death of the grey dawn. He opened the porthole.
Outside, the sea was dancing and gay, and the receding
coastline, that had been black and mysterious,
was now green and beautiful. A sudden delicious scent
of frying bacon came down-wind from the galley.
Abruptly Bond pulled the porthole to and dressed and
went along to the saloon.</p>

<p class="pindent">Over a mound of fried eggs and bacon washed down
with hot sweet coffee laced with rum, Colombo dotted
the i’s and crossed the t’s.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘This we have done, my friend,’ he said through
crunching toast. ‘That was a year’s supply of raw
opium on its way to Kristatos’s chemical works in
Naples. It is true that I have such a business in Milan
and that it is a convenient depot for some of my wares.
But it fabricates nothing more deadly than cascara
and aspirin. For all that part of Kristatos’s story, read
Kristatos instead of Colombo. It is he who breaks the
stuff down into heroin and it is he who employs the
couriers to take it to London. That huge shipment was
worth perhaps a million pounds to Kristatos and his
men. But do you know something, my dear James? It
cost him not one solitary cent. Why? Because it is a
gift from Russia. The gift of a massive and deadly projectile
to be fired into the bowels of England. The
Russians can supply unlimited quantities of the charge
for the projectile. It comes from their poppy-fields in
the Caucasus, and Albania is a convenient entrepôt.
But they have not the apparatus to fire this projectile.
The man Kristatos created the necessary apparatus,
and it is he, on behalf of his masters in Russia, who
pulls the trigger. Today, between us, we have destroyed,
in half an hour, the entire conspiracy. You
can now go back and tell your people in England that
the traffic will cease. You can also tell them the truth—that
Italy was not the origin of this terrible underground
weapon of war. That it is our old friends the
Russians. No doubt it is some psychological warfare
section of their Intelligence apparatus. That I cannot
tell you. Perhaps, my dear James,’ Colombo smiled
encouragingly, ‘they will send you to Moscow to find
out. If that should happen, let us hope you will find
some girl as charming as your friend Fräulein Lisl
Baum to put you on the right road to the truth.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What do you mean “my friend”? She’s yours.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Colombo shook his head. ‘My dear James, I have
many friends. You will be spending a few more days in
Italy writing your report, and no doubt,’ he chuckled,
‘checking on some of the things I have told you. Perhaps
you will also have an enjoyable half an hour
explaining the facts of life to your colleagues in American
Intelligence. In between these duties you will
need companionship—someone to show you the
beauties of my beloved homeland. In uncivilized
countries, it is the polite custom to offer one of your
wives to a man whom you love and wish to honour.
I also am uncivilized. I have no wives, but I have
many such friends as Lisl Baum. She will not need to
receive any instructions in this matter. I have good
reason to believe that she is awaiting your return this
evening.’ Colombo fished in his trousers pocket and
tossed something down with a clang on the table in
front of Bond. ‘Here is the good reason.’ Colombo put
his hand to his heart and looked seriously into Bond’s
eyes. ‘I give it to you from my heart. Perhaps also from
hers.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond picked the thing up. It was a key with a heavy
metal tag attached. The metal tag was inscribed
<span class="it">Albergo Danielli. Room 68</span>.</p>
