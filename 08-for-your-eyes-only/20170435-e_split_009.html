<p class="line19">———— * ————</p>

<p class="line2"><span class="sc">James Bond</span> said: ‘I’ve always thought that if I ever
married I would marry an air hostess.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The dinner party had been rather sticky, and now
that the other two guests had left accompanied by the
A.D.C. to catch their plane, the Governor and Bond
were sitting together on a chintzy sofa in the large
Office of Works furnished drawing-room, trying to
make conversation. Bond had a sharp sense of the
ridiculous. He was never comfortable sitting deep in
soft cushions. He preferred to sit up in a solidly upholstered
armed chair with his feet firmly on the
ground. And he felt foolish sitting with an elderly
bachelor on this bed of rose chintz gazing at the coffee
and liqueurs on the low table between their outstretched
feet. There was something clubable, intimate,
even rather feminine, about the scene and
none of these atmospheres was appropriate.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond didn’t like Nassau. Everyone was too rich.
The winter visitors and the residents who had houses
on the island talked of nothing but their money, their
diseases and their servant problems. They didn’t even
gossip well. There was nothing to gossip about. The
winter crowd were all too old to have love affairs and,
like most rich people, too cautious to say anything
malicious about their neighbours. The Harvey Millers,
the couple that had just left, were typical—a pleasant
rather dull Canadian millionaire who had got into
Natural Gas early on and stayed with it, and his pretty
chatterbox of a wife. It seemed that she was English.
She had sat next to Bond and chattered vivaciously
about ‘what shows he had recently seen in town’ and
‘didn’t he think the Savoy Grill was the nicest place for
supper. One saw so many interesting people—actresses
and people like that’. Bond had done his
best, but since he had not seen a play for two years, and
then only because the man he was following in Vienna
had gone to it, he had had to rely on rather dusty
memories of London night life which somehow failed
to marry up with the experiences of Mrs Harvey Miller.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond knew that the Governor had asked him to
dinner only as a duty, and perhaps to help out with
the Harvey Millers. Bond had been in the Colony for
a week and was leaving for Miami the next day. It
had been a routine investigation job. Arms were
getting to the Castro rebels in Cuba from all the neighbouring
territories. They had been coming principally
from Miami and the Gulf of Mexico, but when the
U.S. Coast Guard had seized two big shipments, the
Castro supporters had turned to Jamaica and the
Bahamas as possible bases, and Bond had been sent
out from London to put a stop to it. He hadn’t wanted
to do the job. If anything, his sympathies were with
the rebels, but the Government had a big export programme
with Cuba in exchange for taking more
Cuban sugar than they wanted, and a minor condition
of the deal was that Britain should not give aid
or comfort to the Cuban rebels. Bond had found out
about the two big cabin cruisers that were being fitted
out for the job, and rather than make arrests when
they were about to sail, thus causing an incident,
he had chosen a very dark night and crept up on
the boats in a police launch. From the deck of the
unlighted launch he had tossed a thermite bomb
through an open port of each of them. He had then
made off at high speed and watched the bonfire from
a distance. Bad luck on the insurance companies, of
course, but there were no casualties and he had
achieved quickly and neatly what M had told him
to do.</p>

<p class="pindent">So far as Bond was aware, no one in the Colony, except
the Chief of Police and two of his officers, knew
who had caused the two spectacular, and—to those in
the know—timely fires in the roadstead. Bond had
reported only to M in London. He had not wished to
embarrass the Governor, who seemed to him an easily
embarrassable man, and it could in fact have been
unwise to give him knowledge of a felony which might
easily be the subject of a question in the Legislative
Council. But the Governor was no fool. He had known
the purpose of Bond’s visit to the Colony, and that
evening, when Bond had shaken him by the hand, the
dislike of a peaceable man for violent action had been
communicated to Bond by something constrained and
defensive in the Governor’s manner.</p>

<p class="pindent">This had been no help to the dinner party, and it had
needed all the chatter and gush of a hard-working
A.D.C. to give the evening the small semblance of life
it had achieved.</p>

<p class="pindent">And now it was only nine-thirty, and the Governor
and Bond were faced with one more polite hour before
they could go gratefully to their beds, each relieved
that he would never have to see the other again. Not
that Bond had anything against the Governor. He belonged
to a routine type that Bond had often encountered
round the world—solid, loyal, competent, sober
and just: the best type of Colonial Civil Servant.
Solidly, competently, loyally he would have filled the
minor posts for thirty years while the Empire crumbled
around him; and now, just in time, by sticking to the
ladders and avoiding the snakes, he had got to the top.
In a year or two it would be the G.C.B. and out—out
to Godalming, or Cheltenham or Tunbridge Wells
with a pension and a small packet of memories of
places like the Trucial Oman, the Leeward Islands,
British Guiana, that no one at the local golf club
would have heard of or would care about. And yet,
Bond had reflected that evening, how many small
dramas such as the affair of the Castro rebels must
the Governor have witnessed or been privy to! How
much he would know about the chequer-board of
small-power politics, the scandalous side of life in
small communities abroad, the secrets of people that
lie in the files of Government Houses round the world.
But how could one strike a spark off this rigid, discreet
mind? How could he, James Bond, whom the
Governor obviously regarded as a dangerous man and
as a possible source of danger to his own career, extract
one ounce of interesting fact or comment to save
the evening from being a futile waste of time?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s careless and slightly mendacious remark
about marrying an air hostess had come at the end of
some desultory conversation about air travel that had
followed dully, inevitably, on the departure of the
Harvey Millers to catch their plane for Montreal.
The Governor had said that B.O.A.C. were getting
the lion’s share of the American traffic to Nassau because,
though their planes might be half an hour
slower from Idlewild, the service was superb. Bond
had said, boring himself with his own banality, that
he would rather fly slowly and comfortably than fast
and uncosseted. It was then that he had made the
remark about air hostesses.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Indeed,’ said the Governor in the polite, controlled
voice that Bond prayed might relax and become
human. ‘Why?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, I don’t know. It would be fine to have a
pretty girl always tucking you up and bringing you
drinks and hot meals and asking if you had everything
you wanted. And they’re always smiling and
wanting to please. If I don’t find an air hostess, there’ll
be nothing for it but marry a Japanese. They seem to
have the right ideas too.’ Bond had no intention of
marrying anyone. If he did, it would certainly not be
an insipid slave. He only hoped to amuse or outrage
the Governor into a discussion of some human topic.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I don’t know about the Japanese, but I suppose it
has occurred to you that these air hostesses are only
<span class="it">trained</span> to please, that they might be quite different
when they’re not on the job, so to speak.’ The
Governor’s voice was reasonable, judicious.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Since I’m not really very interested in getting
married, I’ve never taken the trouble to investigate.’</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a pause. The Governor’s cigar had gone
out. He spent a moment or two getting it going again.
When he spoke it seemed to Bond that the even tone
had gained a spark of life, of interest. The Governor
said: ‘There was a man I knew once who must have
had the same ideas as you. He fell in love with an air
hostess and married her. Rather an interesting story,
as a matter of fact. I suppose,’ the Governor looked
sideways at Bond and gave a short self-deprecatory
laugh, ‘you see quite a lot of the seamy side of life.
This story may seem to you on the dull side. But would
you care to hear it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Very much.’ Bond put enthusiasm into his voice.
He doubted if the Governor’s idea of what was seamy
was the same as his own, but at least it would save him
from making any more asinine conversation. Now to
get away from this damnably cloying sofa. He said:
‘Could I have some more brandy?’ He got up, dashed
an inch of brandy into his glass and, instead of going
back to the sofa, pulled up a chair and sat down at an
angle from the Governor on the other side of the drink-tray.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Governor examined the end of his cigar, took a
quick pull and held the cigar upright so that the long
ash would not fall off. He watched the ash warily
throughout his story and spoke as if to the thin trickle
of blue smoke that rose and quickly disappeared in the
hot, moist air.</p>

<p class="pindent">He said carefully: ‘This man—I’ll call him Masters,
Philip Masters—was almost a contemporary of mine
in the Service. I was a year ahead of him. He went to
Fettes and took a scholarship for Oxford—the name
of the college doesn’t matter—and then he applied
for the Colonial Service. He wasn’t a particularly
clever chap, but he was hard-working and capable and
the sort of man who makes a good solid impression on
interview boards. They took him into the Service. His
first post was Nigeria. He did well in it. He liked the
natives and he got on well with them. He was a man
of liberal ideas and while he didn’t actually fraternize,
which,’ the Governor smiled sourly, ‘would have got
him into trouble with his superiors in those days, he
was lenient and humane towards the Nigerians. It
came as quite a surprise to them.’ The Governor
paused and took a pull at his cigar. The ash was about
to fall and he bent carefully over towards the drink-tray
and let the ash hiss into his coffee-cup. He sat
back and for the first time looked across at Bond. He
said: ‘I daresay the affection this young man had for
the natives took the place of the affection young men
of that age in other walks of life have for the opposite
sex. Unfortunately Philip Masters was a shy and rather
uncouth young man who had never had any kind of
success in that direction. When he hadn’t been working
to pass his various exams he had played hockey for
his college and rowed in the third eight. In the holidays
he had stayed with an aunt in Wales and climbed
with the local mountaineering club. His parents, by
the way, had separated when he was at his public
school and, though he was an only child, had not
bothered with him once he was safe at Oxford with his
scholarship and a small allowance to see him through.
So he had very little time for girls and very little to
recommend him to those he did come across. His
emotional life ran along the frustrated and unhealthy
lines that were part of our inheritance from our Victorian
grandfathers. Knowing how it was with him, I
am therefore suggesting that his friendly relations with
the coloured people of Nigeria were what is known as a
compensation seized on by a basically warm and full-blooded
nature that had been starved of affection and
now found it in their simple kindly natures.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond interrupted the rather solemn narrative. ‘The
only trouble with beautiful Negresses is that they don’t
know anything about birth control. I hope he managed
to stay out of that sort of trouble.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Governor held up his hand. His voice held an
undertone of distaste for Bond’s earthiness. ‘No, no.
You misunderstand me. I am not talking about sex.
It would never have occurred to this young man to
have relations with a coloured girl. In fact he was
sadly ignorant of sexual matters. Not a rare thing even
today among young people in England, but very common
in those days, and the cause, as I expect you will
agree, of many—very many—disastrous marriages
and other tragedies.’ Bond nodded. ‘No, I am only
explaining this young man at some length to show you
that what was to come fell upon a frustrated young
innocent with a warm but unawakened heart and
body, and a social clumsiness which made him seek
companionship and affection amongst the Negroes instead
of in his own world. He was, in short, a sensitive
misfit, physically uninteresting, but in all other respects
healthy and able and a perfectly adequate citizen.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took a sip of his brandy and stretched out his
legs. He was enjoying the story. The Governor was
telling it in a rather elderly narrative style which gave
it a ring of truth.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Governor continued: ‘Young Masters’s service
in Nigeria coincided with the first Labour Government.
If you remember, one of the first things they
got down to was a reform of the foreign services.
Nigeria got a new Governor with advanced views on
the native problem who was surprised and pleased to
find that he had a junior member of his staff who was
already, in his modest sphere, putting something like
the Governor’s own views into practice. He encouraged
Philip Masters, gave him duties which were above
his rank, and in due course, when Masters was due for
a move, he wrote such a glowing report that Masters
jumped a grade and was transferred to Bermuda as
Assistant Secretary to Government.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Governor looked through his cigar smoke at
Bond. He said apologetically: ‘I hope you aren’t being
too bored by all this. I shan’t be long in coming to the
point.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m very interested indeed. I think I’ve got a picture
of the man. You must have known him well.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Governor hesitated. He said: ‘I got to know him
still better in Bermuda. I was just his senior and
he worked directly under me. However, we haven’t
quite got to Bermuda yet. It was the early days of the
air services to Africa and, for one reason or another,
Philip Masters decided to fly home to London and so
have a longer home leave than if he had taken ship
from Freetown. He went by train to Nairobi and
caught the weekly service of Imperial Airways—the
forerunner of B.O.A.C. He had never flown before
and he was interested but slightly nervous when they
took off, after the air hostess, whom he noticed was
very pretty, had given him a sweet to suck and shown
him how to fasten his seat-belt. When the plane had
levelled out and he found that flying seemed a more
peaceful business than he had expected, the hostess
came back down the almost empty plane. She smiled
at him. ‘You can undo the belt now.’ When Masters
fumbled with the buckle she leant down and undid it
for him. It was an intimate little gesture. Masters had
never been so close to a woman of about his own age in
his life. He blushed and felt an extraordinary confusion.
He thanked her. She smiled rather saucily at
his embarrassment and sat on the arm of the empty
seat across the aisle and asked him where he had come
from and where he was going. He told her. In his turn,
he asked her about the plane and how fast they were
flying and where they would stop, and so forth. He
found her very easy to talk to and almost dazzlingly
pretty to look at. He was surprised at her easy way
with him and her apparent interest in what he had to
say about Africa. She seemed to think he led a far more
exciting and glamorous life than, to his mind, he did.
She made him feel important. When she went away to
help the two stewards prepare lunch, he sat and
thought about her and thrilled to his thoughts. When
he tried to read he could not focus on the page. He had
to be looking up the plane to catch a glimpse of her.
Once she caught his gaze and gave him what seemed
to him a secret smile. We are the only young people
on the plane, it seemed to say. We understand each
other. We’re interested in the same sort of things.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Philip Masters gazed out of the window, seeing her
in the sea of white clouds below. In his mind’s eye he
examined her minutely, marvelling at her perfection.
She was small and trim with a milk-and-roses complexion
and fair hair tied in a neat bun. (He particularly
liked the bun. It suggested that she wasn’t
“fast”.) She had cherry red smiling lips and blue eyes
that sparkled with mischievous fun. Knowing Wales,
he guessed that she had Welsh blood in her, and this
was confirmed by her name, Rhoda Llewellyn, which,
when he went to wash his hands before luncheon, he
found printed at the bottom of the crew-list above the
magazine rack beside the lavatory door. He speculated
deeply about her. She would be near him now for
nearly two days, but how could he get to see her again?
She must have hundreds of admirers. She might even
be married. Did she fly all the time? How many
days off did she get between trips? Would she laugh
at him if he asked her out to dinner and a theatre?
Might she even complain to the captain of the aircraft
that one of the passengers was getting fresh? A
sudden vision came to Masters of being turned off the
plane at Aden, a complaint to the Colonial Office, his
career ruined.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Luncheon came, and reassurance. When she fitted
the little tray across his knees, her hair brushed his
cheek. Masters felt that he had been touched by a live
electric wire. She showed him how to deal with the
complicated little cellophane packages, how to get the
plastic lid off the salad dressing. She told him that the
sweet was particularly good—a rich layer cake. In
short she made a fuss of him, and Masters couldn’t
remember when it had ever happened before, even
when his mother had looked after him as a child.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘At the end of the trip, when the sweating Masters
had screwed up his courage to ask her out to dinner, it
was almost an anticlimax when she readily agreed. A
month later she resigned from Imperial Airways and
they were married. A month after that, Masters’s leave
was up and they took ship for Bermuda.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said: ‘I fear the worst. She married him because
his life sounded exciting and “grand”. She liked
the idea of being the belle of the tea-parties at Government
House. I suppose Masters had to murder her in
the end.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No,’ said the Governor mildly. ‘But I daresay
you’re right about why she married him, that and
being tired of the grind and danger of flying. Perhaps
she really meant to make a go of it, and certainly
when the young couple arrived and settled into their
bungalow on the outskirts of Hamilton we were all
favourably impressed by her vivacity and her pretty
face and by the way she made herself pleasant to
everyone. And, of course, Masters was a changed man.
Life had become a fairy-tale for him. Looking back, it
was almost pitiful to watch him try to spruce himself
up so that he could live up to her. He took trouble
about his clothes, put some dreadful brilliantine on his
hair and even grew a military-type moustache, presumably
because she thought it looked distinguished.
At the end of the day, he would hurry back to the
bungalow, and it was always Rhoda this and Rhoda
that and when do you think Lady Burford—who
was the Governor’s wife—is going to ask Rhoda to
lunch?</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But he worked hard and everyone liked the young
couple, and things went along like a marriage bell for
six months or so. Then, and now I’m only guessing,
the occasional word began to drop like acid in the
happy little bungalow. You can imagine the sort of
thing: “Why doesn’t the Colonial Secretary’s wife
ever take me out shopping with her? How long must
we wait before we can give another cocktail party?
You know we can’t afford to have a baby. When are
you due for promotion? It’s awfully dull here all day
with nothing to do. You’ll have to get the dinner tonight.
I simply can’t be bothered. You have such an
interesting time. It’s all right for you . . .” and so on
and so forth. And of course the cosseting quickly went
by the board. Now it was Masters, and of course he
was delighted to do it, who brought the air hostess
breakfast in bed before he went off to work. It was
Masters who tidied up the house when he came back
in the evening and found cigarette ash and chocolate
papers all over the place. It was Masters who had to
give up smoking and his occasional drink to buy her
new clothes so that she could live up to the other wives.
Some of this showed, at any rate to me who knew
Masters well, in the Secretariat. The preoccupied
frown, the occasional enigmatic, over-solicitous telephone
call in office hours, the ten minutes stolen at the
end of the day so that he could take Rhoda to the
cinema, and, of course, the occasional half-joking
questions about marriage in general: What do other
wives do all day long? Do most women find it a bit
hot out here? I suppose women (he almost added
“God bless ’em”) are much more easily upset than
men. And so forth. The trouble, or at least most of it,
was that Masters was besotted. She was his sun and his
moon and if she was unhappy or restless it was all his
fault. He cast about desperately for something that
would occupy her and make her happy, and finally,
of all things, he settled—or rather they settled together—on
golf. Golf is very much the thing in Bermuda.
There are several fine links—including the
famous Mid-Ocean Club where all the quality play
and get together at the club afterwards for gossip and
drinks. It was just what she wanted—a smart occupation
and high society. God knows how Masters saved
up enough to join and buy her the clubs and the lessons
and all the rest, but somehow he did it and it was a
roaring success. She took to spending all day at the
Mid-Ocean. She worked hard at her lessons and got a
handicap and met people through the little competitions
and the monthly medals, and in six months she
was not only playing a respectable game but had become
quite the darling of the men members. I wasn’t
surprised. I remember seeing her there from time to
time, a delicious sunburned little figure in the shortest
of shorts with a white eyeshade with a green lining,
and a trim compact swing that flattered her figure,
and I can tell you,’ the Governor twinkled briefly,
‘she was the prettiest thing I’ve ever seen on a golf
course. Of course the next step didn’t take long. There
was a mixed-foursome competition. She was partnered
with the oldest Tattersall boy—they’re the leading
Hamilton merchants and more or less the ruling clique
in Bermudan society. He was a young hellion—handsome
as be damned, a beautiful swimmer and a
scratch golfer, with an open MG and a speed-boat and
all the trimmings. You know the type. Got all the girls
he wanted, and, if they didn’t sleep with him pretty
quickly, they didn’t get the rides in the MG or the
Chris-Craft or the evenings in the local night clubs. The
couple won the competition after a hard fight in the
final and Philip Masters was in the fashionable crowd
round the eighteenth green to cheer them home.
That was the last time he cheered for many a long
day, perhaps for all his life. Almost at once she started
“going” with young Tattersall, and once started she
went like the wind. And believe me, Mr Bond’—the
Governor closed a fist and brought it softly down on
the edge of the drinks-table—‘it was ghastly to see.
She didn’t make the smallest attempt to soften the
blow or hide the affair in any way. She just took young
Tattersall and hit Masters in the face with him, and
went on hitting. She would come home at any hour
of the night—she had insisted that Masters should
move into the spare room, some pretext about it being
too hot to sleep together—and if she ever tidied the
house or cooked him a meal it was only makeshift and
to keep up some kind of appearance. Of course, in a
month, the whole thing was public property and poor
Masters was wearing the biggest pair of horns that
had ever been seen in the Colony. Lady Burford finally
stepped in and gave Rhoda Masters a talking to—said
she was ruining her husband’s career and so
forth. But the trouble was that Lady Burford found
Masters a pretty dull dog, and having perhaps had one
or two escapades in her own youth—she was still a
handsome woman with a twinkle in her eye—she was
probably a bit too lenient with the girl. Of course
Masters himself, as he was to tell me later, went
through the usual dreary sequence—remonstrance,
bitter quarrel, furious rage, violence (he told me he
damned nearly throttled her one night) and, finally,
icy withdrawal and sullen misery.’ The Governor
paused. ‘I don’t know if you’ve ever seen a heart being
broken, Mr Bond, broken slowly and deliberately.
Well, that’s what I saw happening to Philip Masters,
and it was a dreadful thing to watch. There he had
been, a man with Paradise in his face, and, within a
year of his arrival in Bermuda, Hell was written all
over it. Of course I did my best, we all did in one way
or another, but once it had happened, on that eighteenth
green at the Mid-Ocean, there was really nothing
to do but try and pick up the bits. But Masters
was like a wounded dog. He just drew away from us
into a corner and snarled when anyone tried to come
near him. I even went to the length of writing him one
or two letters. He later told me he had torn them up
without reading them. One day, several of us got together
and asked him to a stag-party in my bungalow.
We tried to get him drunk. We got him drunk all
right. The next thing that happened was a crash
from the bathroom. Masters had tried to cut his wrists
with my razor. That broke our nerve and I was deputed
to go and see the Governor about the whole
business. The Governor knew about it, of course, but
had hoped he wouldn’t have to interfere. Now the
question was whether Masters could even stay on in
the Service. His work had gone to pieces. His wife was
a public scandal. He was a broken man. Could we
stick the bits together again? The Governor was a fine
man. Once action had been forced on him, he was
determined to make a last effort to stave off the almost
inevitable report to Whitehall which would finally
smash what remained of Masters. And Providence
stepped in to lend a hand. The very next day after my
interview with the Governor, there was a dispatch
from the Colonial Office saying that there was to be a
meeting in Washington to delineate off-shore fishing
rights, and that Bermuda and the Bahamas had been
invited to send representatives of their Governments.
The Governor sent for Masters, spoke to him like a
Dutch uncle, told him that he was being sent to Washington
and that he had better have his domestic affairs
settled one way or the other in the next six months,
and packed him off. Masters left in a week and sat in
Washington talking fish for five months, and we all
heaved a sigh of relief and cut Rhoda Masters whenever
we could find an opportunity to do it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Governor stopped speaking and it was silent in
the big, brightly lit drawing-room. He took out a
handkerchief and wiped it over his face. His memories
had excited him and his eyes were bright in the
flushed face. He got to his feet and poured a whisky
and soda for Bond, and one for himself.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said: ‘What a mess. I suppose something like
that was bound to happen sooner or later, but it was
bad luck on Masters that it had to happen so soon.
She must have been a hard-hearted little bitch. Did
she show any signs of being sorry for what she’d done?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Governor had finished lighting a fresh cigar.
He looked at the glowing tip and blew on it. He said:
‘Oh no. She was having a wonderful time. She probably
knew it wouldn’t last for ever, but it was what she
had dreamed about—what the readers of women’s
magazines dream about, and she was pretty typical of
that sort of mentality. She had everything—the best
catch on the island, love on the sands under the palm
trees, gay times in the town and at the Mid-Ocean,
fast drives in the car and the speed-boat—all the
trappings of cheap romance. And, to fall back on, a
slave of a husband well out of the way, and a house to
have a bath in and change her clothes and get some
sleep. And she knew she could get Philip Masters back.
He was so abject. There would be no difficulty. And
then she could go round and apologize to everyone
and turn on the charm again and everyone would forgive
her. It would be all right. If it wasn’t all right,
there were plenty of other men in the world besides
Philip Masters—and more attractive ones at that.
Why, look at all the men at the golf club! She could
have her pick of them at the drop of a hat. No, life was
good, and if one was being a bit naughty it was after
all only the way plenty of other people behaved. Look
at the way the film-stars went on in Hollywood!</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, she was soon put to the test. Tattersall got a
bit tired of her and, thanks to the Governor’s wife, the
Tattersall parents were making the hell of a fuss. That
gave Tattersall a good excuse to get out of it all without
too much of a scene. And it was summer and the
island was flooded with pretty American girls. It was
time for some fresh blood. So he chucked Rhoda
Masters. Like that. Just told her they were through.
That his parents had insisted or they would cut off his
allowance. It was a fortnight before Philip Masters
was due back from Washington, and I will say she
took it well. She was tough and she had known it
would have to come some time or other. She didn’t
squeal. For that matter there was no one to squeal to.
She just went and told Lady Burford that she was
sorry and that she was now going to be a good wife to
Philip Masters, and she started on the house and
cleaned it up and got everything shipshape ready for
the big reconciliation scene. The necessity for bringing
about this reconciliation was made clear to her by the
attitude of her former cronies at the Mid-Ocean. She
had suddenly become bad news there. You know how
these things can happen, even in an open-handed
place like a country club in the tropics. Now not only
the Government House set but also the Hamilton
merchants clique frowned on her. She was suddenly
shoddy goods, used and discarded. She tried to be the
same gay little flirt, but it didn’t work any more. She
got sharply snubbed once or twice and stopped going.
Now it was vital to get back to a secure base and start
slowly working her way up again. She stayed at home
and set to with a will, rehearsing over and over again
the act she would put on—the tears, the air hostess
cosseting, the lengthy, sincere excuses and explanations,
the double bed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And then Philip Masters came home.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Governor paused and looked reflectively over
at Bond. He said: ‘You’re not married, but I think it’s
the same with all relationships between a man and a
woman. They can survive anything so long as some
kind of basic humanity exists between the two people.
When all kindness has gone, when one person obviously
and sincerely doesn’t care if the other is alive or
dead, then it’s just no good. That particular insult to
the ego—worse, to the instinct of self-preservation—can
never be forgiven. I’ve noticed this in hundreds of
marriages. I’ve seen flagrant infidelities patched up,
I’ve seen crimes and even murder forgiven by the
other party, let alone bankruptcy and every other
form of social crime. Incurable disease, blindness,
disaster—all these can be overcome. But never the
death of common humanity in one of the partners. I’ve
thought about this and I’ve invented a rather high-sounding
title for this basic factor in human relations.
I have called it the Law of the Quantum of Solace.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said: ‘That’s a splendid name for it. It’s certainly
impressive enough. And of course I see what
you mean. I should say you’re absolutely right.
Quantum of Solace—the amount of comfort. Yes, I
suppose you could say that all love and friendship is
based in the end on that. Human beings are very insecure.
When the other person not only makes you
feel insecure but actually seems to want to destroy
you, it’s obviously the end. The Quantum of Solace
stands at zero. You’ve got to get away to save yourself.
Did Masters see that?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Governor didn’t answer the question. He said:
‘Rhoda Masters should have been warned when her
husband walked through the bungalow door. It
wasn’t so much what she saw on the surface—though
the moustache had gone and Masters’s hair was once
again the untidy mop of their first meeting—it was the
eyes and the mouth and the set of the chin. Rhoda
Masters had put on her quietest frock. She had taken
off most of her make-up and had arranged herself in a
chair where the light from the window left her face in
half-shadow and illuminated the pages of the book on
her lap. She had decided that, when he came through
the door, she would look up from her book, docilely,
submissively, and wait for him to speak. Then she
would get up and come quietly to him and stand in
front of him with her head bowed. She would tell him
all and let the tears come and he would take her in his
arms and she would promise and promise. She had
practised the scene many times until she was satisfied.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘She duly glanced up from her book. Masters
quietly put down his suitcase and walked slowly over
to the mantelpiece and stood looking vaguely down at
her. His eyes were cold and impersonal and without
interest. He put his hand in his inside pocket and took
out a piece of paper. He said in the matter-of-fact
voice of a house agent: “Here is a plan of the house. I
have divided the house in two. Your rooms are the
kitchen and your bedroom. Mine are this room and
the spare bedroom. You may use the bathroom when
I am not in it.” He leant over and dropped the paper
on the open pages of her book. “You are never to
enter my rooms except when we have friends in.”
Rhoda Masters opened her mouth to speak. He held
up his hand. “This is the last time I shall speak to you
in private. If you speak to me, I shall not answer. If
you wish to communicate, you may leave a note in the
bathroom. I shall expect my meals to be prepared
punctually and placed in the dining-room, which you
may use when I have finished. I shall give you twenty
pounds a month to cover the housekeeping, and this
amount will be sent to you by my lawyers on the first
of each month. My lawyers are preparing the divorce
papers. I am divorcing you, and you will not fight the
action because you cannot. A private detective has
provided full evidence against you. The action will
take place in one year from now when my time in
Bermuda is up. In the meantime, in public, we shall
behave as a normal married couple.”</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Masters put his hands in his pockets and looked
politely down at her. By this time tears were pouring
down her face. She looked terrified—as if someone
had hit her. Masters said indifferently: “Is there anything
else you’d like to know? If not, you had better
collect your belongings from here and move into the
kitchen.” He looked at his watch. “I would like dinner
every evening at eight. It is now seven-thirty.” ’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Governor paused and sipped his whisky. He
said: ‘I’ve put all this together from the little that
Masters told me and from the fuller details Rhoda
Masters gave to Lady Burford. Apparently Rhoda
Masters tried every way to shake him—arguments,
pleadings, hysterics. He was unmoved. She simply
couldn’t reach him. It was as if he had gone away and
had sent someone else to the house to represent him at
this extraordinary interview. And in the end she had
to agree. She had no money. She couldn’t possibly
afford the passage to England. To have a bed and food
she had to do what he told her. And so it was. For a
year they lived like that, polite to each other in public,
but utterly silent and separate when they were alone.
Of course, we were all astonished by the change.
Neither of them told anyone of the arrangement. She
would have been ashamed to do so and there was no
reason why Masters should. He seemed to us a bit
more withdrawn than before, but his work was first-class
and everyone heaved a sigh of relief and agreed
that by some miracle the marriage had been saved.
Both of them gained great credit from the fact, and
they became a popular couple with everything forgiven
and forgotten.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The year passed and it was time for Masters to go.
He announced that Rhoda would stay behind to close
the house, and they went through the usual round of
farewell parties. We were a bit surprised that she didn’t
come to see him off in the ship, but he said she wasn’t
feeling well. So that was that until, in a couple of
weeks, news of the divorce case began leaking back
from England. Then Rhoda Masters turned up at
Government House and had a long interview with
Lady Burford, and gradually the whole story, including
its really terrible next chapter, leaked out.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Governor swallowed the last of his whisky. The
ice made a hollow rattle as he put the glass softly
down. He said: ‘Apparently on the day before Masters
left he found a note from his wife in the bathroom. It
said that she simply must see him for one last talk before
he left her for ever. There had been notes like this
before and Masters had always torn them up and left
the bits on the shelf above the basin. This time he
scribbled a note giving her an appointment in the
sitting-room at six o’clock that evening. When the
time arrived, Rhoda Masters came meekly in from the
kitchen. She had long since given up making emotional
scenes or trying to throw herself on his mercy. Now
she just quietly stood and said that she had only ten
pounds left from that month’s housekeeping money
and nothing else in the world. When he left she would
be destitute.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘ “You have the jewels I gave you, and the fur cape.”</p>

<p class="pindent">‘ “I’d be lucky if I got fifty pounds for them.”</p>

<p class="pindent">‘ “You’ll have to get some work.”</p>

<p class="pindent">‘ “It’ll take time to find something. I’ve got to
live somewhere. I have to be out of the house in a
fortnight. Won’t you give me anything at all? I shall
starve.”</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Masters looked at her dispassionately. “You’re
pretty. You’ll never starve.”</p>

<p class="pindent">‘ “You must help me, Philip. You must. It won’t
help your career having me begging at Government
House.”</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nothing in the house belonged to them except a
few odds and ends. They had taken it furnished. The
owner had come the week before and agreed the
inventory. There only remained their car, a Morris
that Masters had bought second-hand, and a radio-gramophone
he had bought as a last resort to try and
keep his wife amused before she took up golf.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Philip Masters looked at her for the last time. He
was never to see her again. He said: “All right. You
can have the car and the radiogram. Now that’s all.
I’ve got to pack. Goodbye.” And he walked out of the
door and up to his room.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Governor looked across at Bond. ‘At least one
last little gesture. Yes?’ The Governor smiled grimly.
‘When he had gone and Rhoda Masters was left alone,
she took the car and her engagement ring and her few
trinkets and the fox fur tippet and went into Hamilton
and drove round the pawnbrokers. In the end she
collected forty pounds for the jewellery and seven
pounds for the bit of fur. Then she went to the car
dealers whose name-plate was on the dashboard of the
car and asked to see the manager. When she asked
how much he would give her for the Morris he
thought she was pulling his leg. “But, madam, Mr
Masters bought the car by hire-purchase and he’s very
badly behind on his payments. Surely he told you that
we had to send him a solicitor’s letter about it only a
week ago. We heard he was leaving. He wrote back
that you would be coming in to make the necessary
arrangements. Let me see”—He reached for a file and
leafed through it. “Yes, there’s exactly two hundred
pounds owing on the car.”</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, of course, Rhoda Masters burst into tears
and in the end the manager agreed to take back the
car, although it wasn’t worth two hundred pounds by
then, but he insisted that she should leave it with him
then and there, petrol in the tank and all. Rhoda
Masters could only accept and be grateful not to be
sued, and she walked out of the garage and along the
hot street and already she knew what she was going
to find when she got to the radio shop. And she was
right. It was the same story, only this time she had to
pay ten pounds to persuade the man to take back the
radiogram. She got a lift back to within walking distance
of the bungalow and went and threw herself
down on the bed and cried for the rest of the day. She
had already been a beaten woman. Now Philip
Masters had kicked her when she was down.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Governor paused. ‘Pretty extraordinary, really.
A man like Masters, kindly, sensitive, who wouldn’t
normally hurt a fly. And here he was performing one
of the cruellest actions I can recall in all my experience.
It was my law operating.’ The Governor smiled
thinly. ‘Whatever her sins, if she had given him that
Quantum of Solace he could never have behaved to
her as he did. As it was, she had awakened in him a
bestial cruelty—a cruelty that perhaps lies deeply
hidden in all of us and that only a threat to our existence
can bring to the surface. Masters wanted to
make the girl suffer, not as much as he had suffered
because that was impossible, but as much as he could
possibly contrive. And that false gesture with the
motor-car and the radio-gramophone was a fiendishly
brilliant bit of delayed action to remind her, even
when he was gone, how much he hated her, how much
he wanted still to hurt her.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said: ‘It must have been a shattering experience.
It’s extraordinary how much people can hurt
each other. I’m beginning to feel rather sorry for the
girl. What happened to her in the end—and to him,
for the matter of that?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Governor got to his feet and looked at his watch.
‘Good heavens, it’s nearly midnight. And I’ve been
keeping the staff up all this time,’ he smiled, ‘as
well as you.’ He walked across to the fireplace and
rang a bell. A Negro butler appeared. The Governor
apologized for keeping him up and told him to lock
up and turn the lights out. Bond was on his feet. The
Governor turned to him. ‘Come along and I’ll tell you
the rest. I’ll walk through the garden with you and
see that the sentry lets you out.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They walked slowly through the long rooms and
down the broad steps to the garden. It was a beautiful
night under a full moon that raced over their heads
through the thin high clouds.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Governor said: ‘Masters went on in the Service,
but somehow he never lived up to his good start. After
the Bermuda business something seemed to go out of
him. Part of him had been killed by the experience.
He was a maimed man. Mostly her fault, of course,
but I guess that what he did to her lived on with him
and perhaps haunted him. He was good at his work,
but he had somehow lost the human touch and he
gradually dried up. Of course he never married again
and in the end he got shunted off into the ground nuts
scheme, and when that was a failure he retired and
went to live in Nigeria—back to the only people in
the world who had shown him any kindness—back to
where it had all started from. Bit tragic, really, when I
remember what he was like when we were young.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And the girl?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, she went through a pretty bad time. We
handed round the hat for her and she pottered in and
out of various jobs that were more or less charity. She
tried to go back to being an air hostess, but the way
she had broken her contract with Imperial Airways
put her out of the running for that. There weren’t so
many airlines in those days and there was no shortage
of applicants for the few hostess jobs that were going.
The Burfords got transferred to Jamaica later in that
same year and that removed her main prop. As I said,
Lady Burford had always had a soft spot for her.
Rhoda Masters was pretty nearly destitute. She still
had her looks and various men had kept her for a
while; but you can’t make the rounds for very long in
a small place like Bermuda, and she was very near to
becoming a harlot and getting into trouble with the
police when Providence again stepped in and decided
she had been punished enough. A letter came from
Lady Burford enclosing her fare to Jamaica and saying
she had got her a job as receptionist at the Blue Hills
Hotel, one of the best of the Kingston hotels. So she
left, and I expect—I’d been transferred to Rhodesia
by then—that Bermuda was heartily relieved to see
the last of her.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Governor and Bond had come to the wide entrance
gates to the grounds of Government House.
Beyond them shone, white and black and pink under
the moon, the huddle of narrow streets and pretty
clapboard houses with gingerbread gables and balconies
that is Nassau. With a terrific clatter the sentry
came to attention and presented arms. The Governor
raised a hand: ‘All right. Stand at ease.’ Again the
clockwork sentry rattled briefly into life and there was
silence.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Governor said: ‘And that’s the end of the story
except for one final quirk of fate. One day a Canadian
millionaire turned up at the Blue Hills Hotel and
stayed for the winter. At the end of the time he took
Rhoda Masters back to Canada and married her.
She’s lived in clover ever since.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good heavens. That was a stroke of luck. Hardly
deserved it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I suppose not. One can’t tell. Life’s a devious business.
Perhaps, for all the harm she’d done to Masters,
Fate decided that she had paid back enough. Perhaps
Masters’s father and mother were the true guilty
people. They had turned Masters into an accident-prone
man. Inevitably he was involved in the emotional
crash that was due to him and that they had
conditioned him for. Fate had chosen Rhoda for its
instrument. Now Fate reimbursed her for her services.
Difficult to judge these things. Anyway, she made her
Canadian very happy. I thought they both seemed
happy tonight.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. Suddenly the violent dramatics of
his own life seemed very hollow. The affair of the
Castro rebels and the burned out yachts was the stuff
of an adventure-strip in a cheap newspaper. He had
sat next to a dull woman at a dull dinner party and a
chance remark had opened for him the book of real
violence—of the Comédie Humaine where human
passions are raw and real, where Fate plays a more
authentic game than any Secret Service conspiracy
devised by Governments.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond faced the Governor and held out his hand. He
said: ‘Thank you for the story. And I owe you an
apology. I found Mrs Harvey Miller a bore. Thanks
to you I shall never forget her. I must pay more attention
to people. You’ve taught me a lesson.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They shook hands. The Governor smiled. ‘I’m
glad the story interested you. I was afraid you might
be bored. You lead a very exciting life. To tell you
the truth, I was at my wit’s end to know what we could
talk about after dinner. Life in the Colonial Service is
very humdrum.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They said good night and Bond walked off down
the quiet street towards the harbour and the British
Colonial Hotel. He reflected on the conference he
would be having in the morning with the Coast Guard
and the F.B.I. in Miami. The prospect, which had
previously interested, even excited him, was now edged
with boredom and futility.</p>
