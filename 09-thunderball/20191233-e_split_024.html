<h3 class="calibre10"><span class="it1">The Red-eyed Catacomb</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">B</span>ond,</span> <span class="lead-in">putting on</span> his clothes, dodged the comments of
Constable Santos. It seemed there had been sort of
underwater explosions, with eruptions on the surface, on the
starboard side of the yacht. Several men had appeared on deck
and there had been some kind of commotion. A boat had been
lowered on the port side, out of sight of the shore. Bond said he
knew nothing of these things. He had cracked his head against
the side of the ship. Silly thing to do. He had seen what he had
wanted to see and had then swum back. Entirely successful.
The Constable had been a great help. Thank you very much
and good night. Bond would be seeing the Commissioner in the
morning.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked with careful steadiness up the side street to
where he had parked Leiter’s Ford. He got to the hotel and
telephoned Leiter’s room and together they drove to police
headquarters. Bond described what had happened and what he
had discovered. Now he didn’t care what the consequences
might be. He was going to make a report. It was eight am in
London and there were under forty hours to go to zero hour.
All these straws added up to half a haystack. His suspicions
were boiling like a pressure cooker. He couldn’t sit on the lid
any longer.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter said decisively, ‘You do just that. And I’ll file a copy to
<span class="s">CIA</span> and endorse it. What’s more I’m going to call up the
<span class="it">Manta</span> and tell her to get the hell over here.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You are?’ Bond was amazed at this change of tune. ‘What’s
got into you all of a sudden?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, I was sculling around the Casino taking a good look at
anyone I thought might be a shareholder or a treasure hunter.
They were mostly in groups, standing around trying to put up
the front of having a good time—a sunshine holiday and all that.
They weren’t succeeding. Largo was doing all the work, being
gay and boyish. The others looked like private dicks or the rest
of the Torrio gang just after the St Valentine’s Day massacre.
Never seen such a bunch of thugs in my life—dressed up in
tuxedos and smoking cigars and drinking champagne and all
that—just a glass or two to show the Christmas spirit. Orders, I
suppose. But all of them with that smell one gets to know in the
Service, or in Pinkertons for the matter of that. You know,
careful, cold-fish, thinking-of-something-else kinda look the
pros have. Well, none of the faces meant anything to me until I
came across a little guy with a furrowed brow and a big egghead
with pebble glasses who looked like a Mormon who’s got
into a whorehouse by mistake. He was peering about nervously
and every time one of these other guys spoke to him he blushed
and said what a wonderful place it was and he was having a
swell time. I got close enough to hear him say the same thing to
two different guys. Rest of the time he just mooned around,
sort of helpless and almost sucking a corner of his handkerchief,
if you get me. Well that face meant something to me. I knew
I’d seen it before somewhere. You know how it is. So after
puzzling for a bit I went to the reception and told one of the
guys behind the desk in a cheery fashion that I thought I’d
located an old class-mate who’d migrated to Europe, but I
couldn’t for the life of me remember his name. Very embarrassing
as he seemed to recognize me. Would the guy help? So he
came along and I pointed this feller out and he went back to
his desk and went through the membership cards and came up
with the one I wanted. Seemed he was a man called Traut,
Emil Traut. Swiss passport. One of Mr Largo’s group from
the yacht.’ Leiter paused. ‘Well I guess it was the Swiss
passport that did it.’ He turned to Bond. ‘Remember a fellow
called Kotze, East German physicist? Came over to the West
about five years ago and sang all he knew to the Joint Scientific
Intelligence boys? Then he disappeared, thanks to a fat payment
for the info, and went to ground in Switzerland. Well,
James, take my word for it. That’s the same guy. The file
went through my hands when I was still with <span class="s">CIA</span> doing desk
work in Washington. All came back to me. It was one hell of a
scoop at the time. Only saw his mug on the file, but there’s
absolutely no doubt about it. That man’s Kotze. And now what
the hell is a top physicist doing on board the <span class="it">Disco</span>? Fits doesn’t
it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">They had come to police headquarters. Lights burned only
on the ground floor. Bond waited until they had reported to the
duty sergeant and had gone up to their room before he
answered. He stood in the middle of the room and looked at
Leiter. He said, ‘That’s the clincher, Felix. So now what do
we do?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘With what you got this evening, I’d pull the whole lot in on
suspicion. No question at all.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Suspicion of what? Largo would reach for his lawyer and
they’d be out in five minutes. Democratic processes of the law
and so forth. And what single fact have we got that Largo
couldn’t dodge? All right, so Traut is Kotze. We’re hunting for
treasure, gentlemen, we need an expert mineralogist. This man
offered his services. Said his name was Traut. No doubt he’s
still worried about the Russians getting after him. Next question?
Yes, we’ve got an underwater compartment on the <span class="it">Disco</span>.
We’re going to hunt treasure through it. Inspect it? Well, if
you must. There you are, gentlemen—underwater gear, skids,
perhaps even a small bathyscaphe. Underwater sentry? Of
course. People have spent six months trying to find out what
we’re after, how we’re going to get it. We’re professionals,
gentlemen. We like to keep our secrets. And anyway, what
was this Mr Bond, this rich gentleman looking for a property
in Nassau, doing underneath my ship in the middle of the night?
Petacchi? Never heard of him. Don’t care what Miss Vitali’s
family name was. Always known her as Vitali . . .’ Bond made a
throwaway gesture with one hand. ‘See what I mean? This
treasure-hunting cover is perfect. It explains everything. And
what are we left with? Largo pulls himself up to his full height
and says, “Thanks, gentlemen. So I may go now? And so I
shall, within the hour, I shall find another base for my work
and you will be hearing from my lawyers forthwith—wrongful
detention and trespass. And good luck to your tourist
trade, gentlemen.” ’ Bond smiled grimly. ‘See what I
mean?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter said impatiently. ‘So what do we do? Limpet mine?
Send her to the bottom—in error, so to speak?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No. We’re going to wait.’ At the expression on Leiter’s face,
Bond held up a hand. ‘We’re going to send our report, in careful,
guarded terms so we don’t get an airborne division landing
on Windsor Field. And we’re going to say the <span class="it">Manta</span> is all we
need. And so it is. With her, we can keep tabs on the <span class="it">Disco</span> just
as we please. And we’ll stay under cover, keep a hidden watch
on the yacht and see what happens. At present we’re not suspected.
Largo’s plan, if there is one, that is, and don’t forget
this treasure-hunting business still covers everything perfectly
well, is going along all right. All he’s got to do now is collect
the bombs and make for Target No 1 ready for zero hour in
around thirty hours’ time. We can do absolutely nothing to
him until he’s got one or both of those bombs on board or we
catch him at their hiding place. Now, that can’t be far away.
Nor can the Vindicator, if she’s hereabouts. So tomorrow we
take that amphibian they’ve got for us and hunt the area inside
a radius of a hundred miles. We’ll hunt the seas and not the
land. She must be in a shoal water somewhere and damned well
hidden. With this calm weather, we should be able to locate her—if
she’s here. Now, come on! Let’s get those reports off and
get some sleep. And say we’re out of communication for ten
hours. And disconnect your telephone when you get back to
your room. However careful we are, this signal is going to set
the Potomac on fire as well as the Thames.’</p>

<p class="line10">★</p>

<p class="pindent">Six hours later, in the crystal light of early morning, they
were out at Windsor Field and the ground crew was hauling
the little Grumman Amphibian out of the hangar with a jeep.
They had climbed on board and Leiter was gunning the engines
when a uniformed motorcycle dispatch rider came driving
uncertainly towards them, across the tarmac.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, ‘Get going! Quick! Here comes paper-work.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter released the brakes and taxi’d fast towards the single
north-south runway. The radio cracked angrily. Leiter took a
careful look over the sky. It was clear. He slowly pushed down
on the joystick and the little plane snarled its way faster and
faster down the concrete and, with a final bump, soared off over
the low bush. The radio still crackled. Leiter reached up and
switched it off.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat with the Admiralty chart on his lap. They were
flying north. They had decided to start with the Grand Bahama
group and have a first look at the possible area of Target No 1.
They flew at a thousand feet. Below them the Berry Islands
were a necklace of brown spits set in cream and emerald and
turquoise. ‘See what I mean?’ said Bond. ‘You can see anything
big through that water down to fifty feet. Anything as big
as the Vindicator would have been spotted anywhere on any
of the air routes. So I’ve marked off the areas where there’s the
minimum traffic. They’d have ditched somewhere well out of
the way. Assuming, and it’s the hell of an assumption, that
when the <span class="it">Disco</span> made off to the south-east on the night of the
third, it was a ruse, it’ll be reasonable to hunt to the north and
the west. She was away eight hours. Two of those would have
been at anchor doing the salvage work. That leaves six hours’
sailing at around thirty knots. Cut an hour off for laying the
false trail, and that leaves five. I’ve marked off an area from the
Grand Bahamas down to south of the Bimini group. That fits—if
anything fits.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Did you get on to the Commissioner?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes. He’s going to have a couple of good men with day-and-night
glasses keeping an eye on the <span class="it">Disco</span>. If she moves from her
Palmyra anchorage where she’s due back at midday, and if
we’re not back in time, he’ll have her shadowed by one of the
Bahama Airways charter planes. I got him quite worried with
just one or two bits of information. He wanted to go to the
Governor with the story. I said not yet. He’s a good man. Just
doesn’t want too much responsibility without someone else’s
okay. I used the <span class="s">PM</span>’s name to keep him quiet until we get
back. He’ll play all right. When do you think the <span class="it">Manta</span> could
be here?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘S’evening, I’d say.’ Leiter’s voice was uneasy. ‘I must have
been drunk last night to have sent for her. Christ, we’re creating
one hell of a flap, James. It doesn’t look too good in the cold
light of dawn. Anyway, what the hell? There’s Grand Bahama
coming up dead ahead. Want me to give the rocket base a buzz?
Prohibited flying area, but we might as well go in up to our ears
while we’re about it. Just listen to the bawling out we’ll be
getting in just a minute or two.’ He reached up and switched
on the radio.</p>

<p class="pindent">They flew eastwards along the fifty miles of beautiful coast
towards what looked like a small city of aluminium hutments
amongst which red and white and silver structures rose like
small skyscrapers above the low roofs. ‘That’s it,’ said Leiter.
‘See the yellow warning balloons at the corners of the base?
Warning to aircraft and fishermen. There’s a flight test on this
morning. Better get out to sea a bit and keep south. If it’s a full
test, they’ll be firing towards Ascension Island—about five
thousand miles east. Off the African coast. Don’t want to get an
Atlas missile up our backsides. Look over there to the left—sticking
up like a pencil beside that red and white gantry! Atlas
or a Titan—intercontinental. Or might be a prototype Polaris.
The other two gantries’ll be for Matador and Snark and perhaps
your Thunderbird. That big gun thing, like a howitzer,
that’s the camera tracker. The two saucer-shaped reflectors
are the radar screen. Golly! One of them’s turning away towards
us! We’re going to get hell in a minute. That strip of
concrete down the middle of the island. That’s the skid strip
for bringing in missiles that are recallable. Can’t see the central
control for telemetering and guidance and destruction of the
things if they go mad. That’ll be underground—one of those
squat block-house things. Some brass hat’ll be sitting down
there with his staff getting all set for the count-down or whatever’s
going to happen and telling someone to do something
about that goddam little plane that’s fouling up the works.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Above their heads the radio crackled. A metallic voice said,
‘<span class="s">N/AKOI</span>, <span class="s">N/AKOI</span>. You’re in a prohibited area. Can you
hear me. Change course southwards immediately. <span class="s">N/AKOI</span>.
This is Grand Bahamas Rocket Base. Keep clear. Keep clear.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter said, ‘Oh hell! No use interfering with world progress.
Anyway we’ve seen all we want. No good getting on the Windsor
Field report to add to our troubles.’ He banked the little
plane sharply. ‘But you see what I mean? If that little heap of
ironmongery isn’t worth a quarter of a billion dollars my
name’s P. Rick. And it’s just about a hundred miles from
Nassau. Perfect for the <span class="it">Disco</span>.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The radio started again: ‘<span class="s">N/AKOI</span>, <span class="s">N/AKOI</span>. You will be
reported for entering a prohibited area and for failing to
acknowledge. Keep flying south and watch out for sudden
turbulence. Over.’ The radio went silent.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter said, ‘That means they’re going to fire a test. Keep an
eye on them and let me know when. I’ll cut down the revs. No
harm in watching ten million dollars of the taxpayer’s money
being blown off. Look! The radar scanner’s turned back to the
east. They’ll be sweating it out in that block-house all right.
I’ve seen ’em at it. Lights’ll be blinking all over the big board
way down underground. The kibitzers’ll be at their periscopes.
Voices’ll come down over the PA System. “Beacon contact. . .
Warning balloons up . . . Telemeter contact . . . Tank
pressure okay . . . Gyros okay . . . Rocket-tank pressure
correct . . . Rocket clear . . . . Recorders alive . . . Lights all
green . . . Ten, nine, eight, seven, six . . . Fire!” ’</p>

<p class="pindent">Despite Leiter’s graphic count-down, nothing happened.
Then, through his glasses, Bond saw a wisp of steam coming
from the base of the rocket. Then a great cloud of steam and
smoke and a flash of bright light that turned red. Breathlessly,
for there was something terrible in the sight, Bond gave the
blow-by-blow to Leiter. ‘It’s edging up off the pad. There’s a
jet of flame. It seems to be sitting on it. Now it’s going up like
a lift. Now it’s off! God, it’s going fast! Now there’s nothing
but a spark of fire in the sky. Now it’s gone. Whew!’ Bond
mopped his brow. ‘Remember that Moonraker job I was on a
few years back? Interesting to see what the people out front
saw.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yeah. You were lucky to get out of that deep fry.’ Leiter
brushed aside Bond’s reminiscences. ‘Now then, next stop
those spits in the ocean north of Bimini and then a good run
down the Bimini Group. Around seventy miles south-west.
Keep an eye out. If we miss those dots, we’ll end up in the
grounds of the Fountain Blue in Miami.’</p>

<p class="pindent">A quarter of an hour later, the tiny necklet of cays showed up.
They were barely above the water line. There was much shoal.
It looked an ideal hiding place for the plane. They came down
to a hundred feet and slowly cruised in a zigzag down the
group. The water was so clear that Bond could see big fish
meandering around the dark clumps of coral and seaweed in
the brilliant sand. A big diamond-shaped stingray cowered and
buried itself in the sand as the black shadow of the plane pursued
and shot over it. There was nothing else and no possibility
of concealment. The green shoal waters were as clean and
innocent as if they had been open desert. The plane flew on
south to North Bimini. Here there were a few houses and some
small fishing hotels. Expensive-looking deep-sea fishing craft
were out, their tall rods streaming. Gay people in the well-decks
waved to the little plane. A girl, sunbathing naked on the roof
of a smart cabin cruiser, hastily snatched at a towel. ‘Authentic
blonde!’ commented Leiter. They flew on south to the Cat
Cays that trail away south from the Biminis. Here there was
still an occasional fishing craft. Leiter groaned. ‘What the hell’s
the good of this? These fishermen would have found it by
now if it was here.’ Bond told him to keep on south. Thirty
miles further south there were little unnamed specks on the
Admiralty chart. Soon the dark blue water began to shoal
again to green. They passed over three sharks circling aimlessly.
Then there was nothing—just dazzling sand under the glassy
surface, and occasional patches of coral.</p>

<p class="pindent">They went on carefully down to where the water turned
again to blue. Leiter said dully, ‘Well, that’s that. Fifty miles
on there’s Andros. Too many people there. Someone would
have heard the plane—if there was a plane.’ He looked at his
watch. ‘11.30. What next, Hawkshaw? I’ve only got fuel for
another two hours’ flying.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Something was itching deep down in Bond’s mind. Something,
some small detail, had raised a tiny question-mark. What
was it? Those sharks! In about forty feet of water! Circling on
the surface! What were they doing there? Three of them.
There must be something—something dead that had brought
them to that particular patch of sand and coral. Bond said
urgently, ‘Just go back up once more, Felix. Over the shoals.
There’s something—’</p>

<p class="pindent">The little plane made a tight turn. Felix cut down the revs
and just kept flying speed about fifty feet above the surface.
Bond opened the door and craned out, his glasses at short
focus. Yes, there were the sharks, two on the surface with their
dorsals out, and one deep down. It was nosing at something. It
had its teeth into something and was pulling at it. Among the
dark and pale patches, a thin straight line showed on the
bottom. Bond shouted, ‘Get back over again!’ The plane
zoomed round and back. Christ! Why did they have to go so
fast? But now Bond had seen another straight line on the bottom,
leading off at 90 degrees from the first. He flopped back
into his seat and banged the door shut. He said quietly, ‘Put
her down over those sharks, Felix. I think this is it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter took a quick glance at Bond’s face. He said, ‘Christ!’
Then, ‘Well, I hope I can make it. Damned difficult to get a
true horizon. This water’s like glass.’ He pulled away, curved
back and slowly put the nose down. There was a slight jerk and
then the hiss of the water under the skids. Leiter cut his engines
and the plane came to a quick stop, rocking in the water about
ten yards from where Bond wanted. The two sharks on the
surface paid no attention. They completed their circle and came
slowly back. They passed so close to the plane that Bond could
see the incurious, pink button eyes. He peered down through
the small ripples cast by the two dorsal fins. Yes! Those ‘rocks’
on the bottom were bogus. They were painted patches. So
were the areas of ‘sand’. Now Bond could clearly see the
straight edges of the giant tarpaulin. The third shark had nosed
back a big section. Now it was shovelling with its flat head
trying to get underneath.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat back. He turned to Leiter. He nodded. ‘That’s it,
all right. Big camouflaged tarpaulin over her. Take a look.’</p>

<p class="pindent">While Leiter leant across Bond and stared down, Bond’s
mind was racing furiously. Get the Police Commissioner on
the police wavelength and report? Get signals sent off to
London? No! If the radio operator on the <span class="it">Disco</span> was doing his
job, he would be keeping watch on the police frequency. So
go on down and have a look. See if the bombs were still there.
Bring up a piece of evidence. The sharks? Kill one and the
others would go for the corpse.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter sat back. His face shining with excitement. ‘Well,
I’ll be goddammed! Boy oh boy!’ He clapped Bond on the
back. ‘We’ve found it! We’ve found the goddam plane.
Whaddya know? Jesus Kerist!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had taken out the Walther <span class="s">PPK</span>. He checked to see
there was a round in the chamber, rested it on his left forearm
and waited for the two sharks to come round again. The first
was the bigger, a hammerhead nearly twelve feet long. Its
hideously distorted head moved slowly from side to side as it
nuzzled through the water, watching what went on below,
waiting for the sign of meat. Bond aimed for the base of the
dorsal fin that cut through the water like a dark sail. It was fully
erect, a sign of tension and awareness in the big fish. Just below
it was the spine, unassailable except with a nickel-plated bullet.
He pulled the trigger. There was a phut as the bullet hit the
surface just behind the dorsal. The boom of the heavy gun
rolled away over the sea. The shark paid no attention. Bond
fired again. The water foamed as the fish reared itself above
the surface, dived shallowly and came up thrashing sideways
like a broken snake. It was a brief flurry. The bullet must have
severed the spinal cord. Now the great brown shape began
moving sluggishly in circles that grew ever wider. The hideous
snout came briefly out of the water to show the sickle mouth
gasping. For a moment it rolled over on its back, its stomach
white to the sun. Then it righted itself and, dead probably,
continued its mechanical, disjointed swim.</p>

<p class="pindent">The following shark had watched all this. Now it approached
cautiously. It made a short snapping run and swerved away.
Feeling safe, it darted in again, seemed to nuzzle at the dying
fish and then lifted its snout above the surface and came down
with all its force, scything into the flank of the hammerhead. It
got hold, but the flesh was tough. It shook its great brown head
like a dog, worrying at the mouthful, and then tore itself away.
A cloud of blood poured over the sea. Now the other shark
appeared from below and both fish, in a frenzy, tore and tore
again at the still moving hulk whose nervous system refused
to die.</p>

<p class="pindent">The dreadful feast moved away on the current and was soon
only a distant splashing on the surface of the quiet sea.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond handed Leiter the gun. ‘I’ll get on down. May be
rather a long job. They’ve got enough to keep them busy for
half an hour, but if they come back, wing one of them. And if
for any reason you want me back on the surface, fire straight
down at the water and go on firing. The shock-wave should just
about reach me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond began to struggle out of his clothes and, with Leiter’s
help, into his aqualung. It was a cramped, difficult business. It
would be still worse getting back into the plane and it occurred
to Bond that he would have to jettison the underwater gear.
Leiter said angrily, ‘I wish to God I could get down there with
you. Trouble with this damned hook, it just won’t swim like a
hand. Have to think up some rubber webbing gadget. Never
occurred to me before.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, ‘You’ll have to keep steam up on this crate. We’ve
already drifted a hundred yards. Get her back up, like a good
chap. I don’t know who I’m going to find sharing the wreck
with me. It’s been here a good five days and other visitors may
have moved in first.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter pressed the starter and taxi’d back into position. He
said, ‘You know the design of the Vindicator? You know where
to look for the bombs and these detonator things the pilot has
charge of?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes. Full briefing in London. Well, so long. Tell Mother I
died game!’ Bond scrambled on to the edge of the cockpit and
jumped.</p>

<p class="pindent">He got his head under and swam leisurely down through the
brilliant water. Now he could see that there were swarms of fish
over the whole area below him—bill fish, small barracuda, jacks
of various types—the carnivores. They parted grudgingly to
make room for their big, pale competitor. Bond touched down
and made for the edge of the tarpaulin that had been dislodged
by the shark. He pulled out a couple of the long corkscrew
skewers that secured it to the sand, switched on his waterproof
torch and, his other hand on his knife, slipped under the
edge.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had been expecting it, but the foulness of the water made
him retch. He clamped his lips more tightly round the mouthpiece
and squirmed on to where the bulk of the plane raised the
tarpaulin into a domed tent. He stood up. His torch glittered on
the underside of a polished wing and then, below it, on to something
that lay under a scrabbling mass of crabs, langoustes, sea-caterpillars
and starfish. This also Bond had been prepared for.
He knelt down to his grisly work.</p>

<p class="pindent">It didn’t take long. He unclipped the gold identification disc
and unlatched the gold wrist-watch from the horrible wrists
and noted the gaping wound under the chin that could not have
been caused by sea creatures. He turned his torch on the gold
disc. It said ‘Giuseppe Petacchi. No 15932’. He strapped the
two bits of evidence to his own wrists and went on towards the
fuselage that loomed in the darkness like a huge silver submarine.
He inspected the exterior, noted the rent where the
hull had been broken on impact, and then climbed up through
the open safety hatch into the interior.</p>

<p class="pindent">Inside, Bond’s torch shone everywhere into red eyes that
glowed like rubies in the darkness and there was a soft movement
and a scuttling. He sprayed the light up and down the
fuselage. Everywhere there were octopuses, small ones, but
perhaps a hundred of them, weaving on the tips of their
tentacles, sliding softly away into protecting shadows, changing
their camouflage nervously from brown to a pale phosphorescence
that gleamed palely in the patches of darkness.
The whole fuselage seemed to be crawling with them, evilly,
horribly, and as Bond shone his torch on the roof the sight was
even worse. There, bumping softly in the slight current, hung
the corpse of a crew member. In decomposition, it had risen up
from the floor, and octopuses, hanging from it like bats, now
let go their hold and shot, jet propelled, to and fro inside the
plane—dreadful, glinting, red-eyed comets that slapped themselves
into dark corners and stealthily squeezed themselves
into cracks and under seats.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond closed his mind to the disgusting nightmare and,
weaving his torch in front of him, proceeded with his search.</p>

<p class="pindent">He found the red-striped cyanide canister and tucked it into
his belt. He counted the corpses, noted the open hatch to the
bomb bay and verified that the bombs had gone. He looked in
the open container under the pilot’s seat and searched in
alternative places for the vital fuses for the bombs. But they
also had gone. Finally, having a dozen times had to slash away
groping tentacles from his naked legs, he felt his nerve was
quickly seeping away. There was much he should have taken
with him, the identification discs of the crew, the pulp of the
log book that showed nothing but routine flight details and no
hint of emergency, readings from the instrument panel, but he
couldn’t stand another second of the squirming, red-eyed
catacomb. He slid out through the escape hatch and swam
almost hysterically towards the thin line of light that was the
edge of the tarpaulin. Desperately, he scrabbled his way under
it, snagged the cylinder on his back in the folds and had to
back under again to free himself. And then he was out in the
beautiful crystal water and soaring up to the surface. At twenty
feet the pain in his ears reminded him to stop and decompress.
Impatiently, staring up at the sweet hull of the seaplane above
him, he waited until the pain had subsided. Then he was up
and clinging to a float and tearing at his equipment to get rid
of it and its contamination. He let it all go and watched it
tumbling slowly down towards the sand. He rinsed his mouth
out with the sweetness of pure salt water and swam to within
reach of Leiter’s outstretched hand.</p>
