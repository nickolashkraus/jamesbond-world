<h3 class="calibre10">‘<span class="it1">Take it easy, Mr Bond</span>’</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> <span class="lead-in">was one</span> of those days when it seemed to James Bond
that all life, as someone put it, was nothing but a heap of
six to four against.</p>

<p class="pindent">To begin with he was ashamed of himself—a rare state of
mind. He had a hangover, a bad one, with an aching head and
stiff joints. When he coughed—smoking too much goes with
drinking too much and doubles the hangover—a cloud of small
luminous black spots swam across his vision like amoebae in
pond water. The one drink too many signals itself unmistakably.
His final whisky and soda in the luxurious flat in Park Lane
had been no different from the ten preceding ones, but it had
gone down reluctantly and had left a bitter taste and an ugly
sensation of surfeit. And, although he had taken in the message,
he had agreed to play just one more rubber. Five pounds a
hundred as it’s the last one? He had agreed. And he had
played the rubber like a fool. Even now he could see the queen
of spades, with that stupid Mona Lisa smile on her fat face,
slapping triumphantly down on his knave—the queen, as his
partner had so sharply reminded him, that had been so
infallibly marked with South, and that had made the difference
between a grand slam redoubled (drunkenly) for him, and
four hundred points above the line for the opposition. In the
end it had been a twenty-point rubber, £100 against him—important
money.</p>

<p class="pindent">Again Bond dabbed with the bloodstained styptic pencil at
the cut on his chin and despised the face that stared sullenly
back at him from the mirror above the washbasin. Stupid,
ignorant bastard! It all came from having nothing to do. More
than a month of paper-work—ticking off his number on stupid
dockets, scribbling minutes that got spikier as the weeks passed,
and snapping back down the telephone when some harmless
section officer tried to argue with him. And then his secretary
had gone down with the flu and he had been given a silly, and,
worse, ugly bitch from the pool who called him ‘sir’ and spoke
to him primly through a mouth full of fruit stones. And now it
was another Monday morning. Another week was beginning.
The May rain thrashed at the windows. Bond swallowed down
two Phensics and reached for the Enos. The telephone in his
bedroom rang. It was the loud ring of the direct line with
Headquarters.</p>

<p class="line10">★</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond, his heart thumping faster than it should have
done, despite the race across London and a fretful wait for the
lift to the eighth floor, pulled out the chair and sat down and
looked across into the calm, grey, damnably clear eyes he knew
so well. What could he read in them?</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good morning, James. Sorry to pull you along a bit early in
the morning. Got a very full day ahead. Wanted to fit you in
before the rush.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s excitement waned minutely. It was never a good sign
when M addressed him by his Christian name instead of by his
number. This didn’t look like a job—more like something personal.
There was none of the tension in M’s voice that heralded
big, exciting news. M’s expression was interested, friendly,
almost benign. Bond said something noncommittal.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Haven’t seen much of you lately, James. How have you
been? Your health, I mean.’ M picked up a sheet of paper, a
form of some kind, from his desk, and held it as if preparing
to read.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suspiciously, trying to guess what the paper said, what all
this was about, Bond said, ‘I’m all right, sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">M said mildly, ‘That’s not what the <span class="s">MO</span> thinks, James. Just
had your last Medical. I think you ought to hear what he has
to say.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked angrily at the back of the paper. Now what the
hell! He said with control, ‘Just as you say, sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">M gave Bond a careful, appraising glance. He held the paper
closer to his eyes. ‘ “This officer”,’ he read, ‘ “remains basically
physically sound. Unfortunately his mode of life is not such as
is likely to allow him to remain in this happy state. Despite
many previous warnings, he admits to smoking sixty cigarettes
a day. These are of a Balkan mixture with a higher nicotine
content than the cheaper varieties. When not engaged upon
strenuous duty, the officer’s average daily consumption of
alcohol is in the region of half a bottle of spirits of between
sixty and seventy proof. On examination, there continues to be
little definite sign of deterioration. The tongue is furred. The
blood pressure a little raised at 160/90. The liver is not palpable.
On the other hand, when pressed, the officer admits to
frequent occipital headaches and there is spasm in the trapezius
muscles and so-called ‘fibrositis’ nodules can be felt. I believe
these symptoms to be due to this officer’s mode of life. He is
not responsive to the suggestion that over-indulgence is no
remedy for the tensions inherent in his professional calling and
can only result in the creation of a toxic state which could
finally have the effect of reducing his fitness as an officer. I
recommend that No 007 should take it easy for two to three
weeks on a more abstemious regime, when I believe he would
make a complete return to his previous exceptionally high state
of physical fitness.” ’</p>

<p class="pindent">M reached over and slid the report into his <span class="g">OUT</span> tray. He put
his hands flat down on the desk in front of him and looked
sternly across at Bond. He said, ‘Not very satisfactory is it,
James?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond tried to keep impatience out of his voice. He said, ‘I’m
perfectly fit, sir. Everyone has occasional headaches. Most
week-end golfers have fibrositis. You get it from sweating and
then sitting in a draught. Aspirin and embrocation get rid
of them. Nothing to it really, sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">M said severely, ‘That’s just where you’re making a big mistake,
James. Taking medicine only suppresses these symptoms
of yours. Medicine doesn’t get to the root of the trouble. It only
conceals it. The result is a more highly poisoned condition
which may become chronic disease. All drugs are harmful to the
system. They are contrary to nature. The same applies to most
of the food we eat—white bread with all the roughage removed,
refined sugar with all the goodness machined out of it, pasteurized
milk which has had most of the vitamins boiled away,
everything overcooked and denaturized. Why,’ M reached into
his pocket for his notebook and consulted it, ‘do you know what
our bread contains apart from a bit of overground flour?’ M
looked accusingly at Bond, ‘It contains large quantities of
chalk, also benzol peroxide powder, chlorine gas, sal ammoniac,
and alum.’ M put the notebook back in his pocket. ‘What do
you think of that?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond, mystified by all this, said defensively, ‘I don’t eat all
that much bread, sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Maybe not,’ said M impatiently. ‘But how much stone-ground
whole wheat do you eat? How much yoghurt?
Uncooked vegetables, nuts, fresh fruit?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled. ‘Practically none at all, sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s no laughing matter.’ M tapped his forefinger on the desk
for emphasis. ‘Mark my words. There is no way to health except
the natural way. All your troubles’—Bond opened his mouth to
protest, but M held up his hand—‘the deep-seated toxaemia
revealed by your Medical, are the result of a basically unnatural
way of life. Ever heard of Bircher-Brenner, for instance? Or
Kneipp, Preissnitz, Rikli, Schroth, Gossmann, Bilz?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No, sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Just so. Well those are the men you would be wise to study.
Those are the great naturopaths—the men whose teaching we
have foolishly ignored. Fortunately,’ M’s eyes gleamed enthusiastically,
‘there are a number of disciples of these men practising
in England. Nature cure is not beyond our reach.’</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond looked curiously at M. What the hell had got
into the old man? Was all this the first sign of senile decay?
But M looked fitter than Bond had ever seen him. The cold
grey eyes were clear as crystal and the skin of the hard, lined
face was luminous with health. Even the iron-grey hair seemed
to have new life. Then what was all this lunacy.</p>

<p class="pindent">M reached for his <span class="g">IN</span> tray and placed it in front of him in a
preliminary gesture of dismissal. He said cheerfully, ‘Well,
that’s all, James. Miss Moneypenny has made the reservation.
Two weeks will be quite enough to put you right. You won’t
know yourself when you come out. New man.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked across at M, aghast. He said in a strangled voice,
‘Out of where, sir?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Place called “Shrublands”. Run by quite a famous man in
his line—Wain, Joshua Wain. Remarkable chap. Sixty-five.
Doesn’t look a day over forty. He’ll take good care of you. Very
up-to-date equipment, and he’s even got his own herb garden.
Nice stretch of country. Near Washington in Sussex. And don’t
worry about your work here. Put it right out of your mind for
a couple of weeks. I’ll tell 009 to take care of the Section.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond couldn’t believe his ears. He said, ‘But, sir. I mean,
I’m perfectly all right. Are you sure? I mean, is this really
necessary?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No,’ M smiled frostily. ‘Not necessary. Essential. If you
want to stay in the Double-O Section, that is. I can’t afford to
have an officer in that section who isn’t one hundred per cent
fit.’ M lowered his eyes to the basket in front of him and took
out a signal file. ‘That’s all, 007.’ He didn’t look up. The tone
of voice was final.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got to his feet. He said nothing. He walked across the
room and let himself out, closing the door with exaggerated
softness.</p>

<p class="pindent">Outside the door, Miss Moneypenny looked sweetly up at
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked over to her desk and banged his fist down so
that the typewriter jumped. He said furiously, ‘Now what the
hell, Penny? Has the old man gone off his rocker? What’s all
this bloody nonsense? I’m damned if I’m going. He’s
absolutely nuts.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Miss Moneypenny smiled happily. ‘The manager’s been
terribly helpful and kind. He says he can give you the Myrtle
room, in the Annex. He says it’s a lovely room. It looks right
over the herb garden. They’ve got their own herb garden,
you know.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I know all about their bloody herb garden. Now look here,
Penny,’ Bond pleaded with her, ‘be a good girl and tell me what
it’s all about. What’s eating him?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Miss Moneypenny, who often dreamed hopelessly about
Bond, took pity on him. She lowered her voice conspiratorially.
‘As a matter-of-fact, I think it’s only a passing phase. But it <span class="it">is</span>
rather bad luck on you getting caught up in it before it’s
passed. You know he’s always apt to get bees in his bonnet
about the efficiency of the Service. There was the time when all
of us had to go through that physical exercise course. Then he
had that head-shrinker in, the psycho-analyst man—you missed
that. You were somewhere abroad. All the Heads of Section
had to tell him their dreams. He didn’t last long. Some of their
dreams must have scared him off or something. Well, last
month M got lumbago and some friend of his at Blades, one
of the fat, drinking ones I suppose,’ Miss Moneypenny turned
down her desirable mouth, ‘told him about this place in the
country. This man swore by it. Told M that we were all like
motor-cars and that all we needed from time to time was to
go to a garage and get decarbonized. He said he went there
every year. He said it only cost twenty guineas a week which
was less than what he spent in Blades in one day and it made
him feel wonderful. Well, you know M always likes trying
new things, and he went there for ten days and came back absolutely
sold on the place. Yesterday he gave me a great talking-to
all about it and this morning in the post I got a whole lot of tins
of treacle and wheat germ and heaven knows what all. I don’t
know what to do with the stuff. I’m afraid my poor poodle’ll
have to live on it. Anyway, that’s what happened and I must
say I’ve never seen him in such wonderful form. He’s absolutely
rejuvenated.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He looks like that blasted man in the old Kruschen Salts
advertisements. But why does he pick on me to go to this nuthouse?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Miss Moneypenny gave a secret smile. ‘You know he thinks
the world of you—or perhaps you don’t. Anyway, as soon as he
saw your Medical he told me to book you in.’ Miss Moneypenny
screwed up her nose. ‘But, James, do you really drink
and smoke as much as that? It can’t be good for you, you
know.’ She looked up at him with motherly eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond controlled himself. He summoned a desperate effort at
nonchalance, at the throwaway phrase, ‘It’s just that I’d rather
die of drink than of thirst. As for the cigarettes, it’s really only
that I don’t know what to do with my hands.’ He heard the
stale, hangover words fall like clinker in a dead grate. Cut out
the schmalz! What you need is a double brandy and soda.</p>

<p class="pindent">Miss Moneypenny’s warm lips pursed into a disapproving
line. ‘About the hands—that’s not what I’ve heard.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now don’t you start on me, Penny.’ Bond walked angrily towards
the door. He turned round. ‘Any more ticking-off from
you and when I get out of this place I’ll give you such a spanking
you’ll have to do your typing off a block of Dunlopillo.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Miss Moneypenny smiled sweetly at him. ‘I don’t think
you’ll be able to do much spanking after living on nuts and
lemon juice for two weeks, James.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond made a noise between a grunt and a snarl and stormed
out of the room.</p>
