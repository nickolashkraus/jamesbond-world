<h3 class="calibre10">‘<span class="it1">My Name is Emilio Largo</span>’</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">L</span>eiter’s</span> ‘<span class="g">SIXPENNY SICK</span>’ was the hotel launch, a smart
Chrysler-engined speedboat that said it would be 20
dollars an hour. They ran out westwards from the harbour, past
Silver Cay, Long Cay and Balmoral Island, and round Delaporte
Point. Five miles further down the coast, encrusted with
glittering seashore properties the boatman said cost £400 per
foot of beach frontage, they rounded Old Fort Point and came
upon the gleaming white and dark blue ship lying with two
anchors out in deep water just outside the reef. Leiter whistled.
He said in an awestruck voice, ‘Boy, is that a piece of boat! I’d
sure like to have one of those to play with in my bath.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, ‘She’s Italian. Built by a firm called Rodrigues at
Messina. Thing called an <span class="it">Aliscafos</span>. She’s got a hydrofoil under
the hull and when she gets going you let this sort of skid down
and she rises up and practically flies. Only the screws and a few
feet of the stern stay in the water. The Police Commissioner
says she can do 50 knots in calm water. Only good for inshore
work of course, but they can carry upwards of a hundred
passengers when they’re designed as fast ferries. Apparently
this one’s been designed for about forty. The rest of the space
is taken up with the owner’s quarters and cargo space. Must
have cost damned near a quarter of a million.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The boatman broke in, ‘They say on Bay Street that she
goin’ go after the treasure these next few days or so. All the
people that own a share in the gold come in a few days ago.
Then she spen’ one whole night doin’ a final recce. They say is
down Exhuma way, or over by Watlings Island. Guess you
folks know that’s where Columbus make him first landfall on
this side of the Atlantic. Around fourteen ninety somethin’.
But could be anywhere down there. They’s always been talk of
treasure down ’mongst the Ragged Islands—even as far as
Crooked Island. Fact is she sail out southward. Hear her
myself, right until her engines died away. East by south-east
I’da say.’ The boatman spat discreetly over the side. ‘Must be
plenty heap of treasure with the cost of that ship and all the
money they throwing ’way. Every time she go to hoiling wharf
they say the bill’s five hundred pound.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said casually, ‘Which night was it they did the final
recce?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Night after she hoiled. That’d be two nights ago. Sail
round six.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The blank portholes of the ship watched them approach. A
sailor polishing brass round the curve of the enclosed dome that
was the bridge walked through the hatch into the bridge and
Bond could see him talking into a mouthpiece. A tall man in
white ducks and a very wide mesh singlet appeared on deck and
observed them through binoculars. He called something to the
sailor, who came and stood at the top of the ladder down the
starboard side. When their launch came alongside, the man
cupped his hands and called down, ‘What is your business
please? Have you an appointment?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond called back, ‘It’s Mr Bond, Mr James Bond. From
New York. I have my attorney here. I have an inquiry to make
about Palmyra, Mr Largo’s property.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘One moment please.’ The sailor disappeared and returned
accompanied by the man in white ducks and singlet. Bond
recognized him from the police description. He called down
cheerfully, ‘Come aboard, come aboard.’ He gestured for the
sailor to go down and help fend the launch. Bond and Leiter
climbed out of the launch and went up the ladder.</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo held out a hand. ‘My name is Emilio Largo. Mr Bond?
And . . . ?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mr Larkin, my attorney from New York. Actually I’m
English, but I have property in America.’ They shook hands.
‘I’m sorry to bother you, Mr Largo, but it’s about Palmyra, the
property I believe you rent from Mr Bryce.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ah yes, of course.’ The beautiful teeth gleamed warmth and
welcome. ‘Come on down to the stateroom, gentlemen. I’m
sorry I am not properly dressed to receive you.’ The big brown
hands caressed his flanks, the wide mouth turned down in deprecation.
‘My visitors usually announce themselves on the
ship-to-shore. But if you will forgive the informality . . .’ Largo
allowed the phrase to die on the air and ushered them through a
low hatch and down a few aluminium steps into the main cabin.
The rubber-lined hatch hissed to behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a fine large cabin panelled in mahogany with deep
wine-red carpet and comfortable dark blue leather club chairs.
The sun shining through the slats of venetian blinds over the
broad square ports added a touch of gay light to an otherwise
rather sombre and masculine room, its long centre table littered
with papers and charts, glass-fronted cabinets containing fishing
gear and an array of guns and other weapons, and a black
rubber underwater diving suit and aqualung suspended, almost
like the skeleton in a sorcerer’s den, from a rack in one corner.
The air-conditioning made the cabin deliciously cool, and Bond
felt his damp shirt slowly freeing itself from his skin.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Please take a chair, gentlemen.’ Largo carelessly brushed
aside the charts and papers on the table as if they were of no
importance. ‘Cigarettes?’ He placed a large silver box between
them. ‘And now what can I get you to drink?’ He went to the
loaded sideboard. ‘Something cool and not too strong perhaps?
A Planter’s Punch? Gin and tonic. Or there are various beers.
You must have had a hot journey in that open launch. I would
have sent my boat for you if only I had known.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They both asked for a plain tonic. Bond said, ‘I’m very sorry
to barge in like this, Mr Largo. No idea I could have got you
on the telephone. We just got in this morning and as I’ve only a
few days I have to get a move on. The point is, I’m looking for
a property down here.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh yes?’ Largo brought the glasses and bottles of tonic to
the table and sat down so that they formed a comfortable
group. ‘What a good idea. Wonderful place. I’ve been here for
six months and already I’d like to stay for ever. But the prices
they’re asking—’ Largo threw up his hands. ‘These Bay Street
pirates. And the millionaires, they are even worse. But you are
wise to come at the end of the season. Perhaps some of the
owners are disappointed not to have sold. Perhaps they will not
open their mouths so wide.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s what I thought.’ Bond sat comfortably back and lit a
cigarette. ‘Or rather what my lawyer, Mr Larkin, advised.’
Leiter shook his head pessimistically. ‘He had made some inquiries
and he frankly advised that real estate values down here
have gone mad.’ Bond turned politely towards Leiter to bring
him into the conversation. ‘Isn’t that so?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Daft, Mr Largo, quite daft. Worse even than Florida. Out of
this world. I wouldn’t advise any client of mine to invest at
these prices.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Quite so.’ Largo obviously didn’t want to get drawn
too deeply into these matters. ‘You mentioned something
about Palmyra. Is there anything I can do to help in that
respect?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, ‘I understand you have a lease of the property, Mr
Largo. And there is talk that you may be leaving the house
before long. Only gossip of course. You know what they are in
these small islands. But it sounds more or less what I’m looking
for and I gather the owner, this Englishman, Bryce, might sell
if he got the right price. What I was going to ask you,’ Bond
looked apologetic, ‘was whether we might drive out and look
the place over. Some time when you weren’t there of course.
Any time that might suit you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo flashed his teeth warmly. He spread his hands. ‘But of
course, of course, my dear fellow. Whenever you wish. There is
no one in residence but my niece and a few servants. And she
is out most of the time. Please just call her up on the telephone.
I shall tell her that you will be doing so. It is indeed a charming
property—so imaginative. A beautiful piece of design. If only
all rich men had such good taste.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got to his feet and Leiter followed suit. ‘Well that’s
extraordinarily kind of you, Mr Largo. And now we’ll leave
you in peace. Perhaps we may meet again in the town some
time. You must come and have lunch. But,’ Bond poured
admiration and flattery into his voice, ‘with a yacht like this, I
don’t suppose you ever want to come ashore. Must be the only
one on this side of the Atlantic. Didn’t one used to run
between Venice and Trieste? I seem to remember reading
about it somewhere.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo grinned his pleasure. ‘Yes, that is right, quite right.
They are also on the Italian lakes. For passenger traffic. Now
they are buying them in South America. A wonderful design
for coastal waters. She only draws four feet when the hydrofoil
is operating.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I suppose accommodation’s the problem?’</p>

<p class="pindent">It is a weakness of all men, though not necessarily of all
women, to love their material possessions. Largo said, with a
trace of pricked vanity, ‘No, no. I think you will find that is not
so. You can spare five minutes? We are rather crowded at the
moment. You have heard no doubt of our treasure hunt?’ He
looked sharply at them as a man would who expects ridicule.
‘But we will not discuss that now. No doubt you do not
believe in these things. But my associates in the affair are all on
board. With the crew, there are forty of us. You will see that we
are not cramped. You would like?’ Largo gestured to the door
in the rear of the stateroom.</p>

<p class="pindent">Felix Leiter showed reluctance. ‘You know, Mr Bond, that
we have that meeting with Mr Harold Christie at five o’clock?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond waved the objection aside. ‘Mr Christie is a charming
man. I know he won’t mind if we are a few minutes late. I’d
love to see over the ship if you’re sure you can spare the time,
Mr Largo.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo said, ‘Come. It will not take more than a few minutes.
The excellent Mr Christie is a friend of mine. He will understand.’
He went to the door and held it open.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had been expecting the politeness. It would interfere
with Leiter and his apparatus. He said firmly, ‘Please go first,
Mr Largo. You will be able to tell us when to duck our heads.’</p>

<p class="pindent">With more affabilities, Largo led the way.</p>

<p class="pindent">Ships, however modern, are more or less the same—the
corridors to port and starboard of the engine room, rows of
cabin doors, which Largo explained were occupied, the large
communal bathrooms, the galley, where two cheerful looking
Italians in white smocks laughed at Largo’s jokes about the food
and seemed pleased with the visitors’ interest, the huge engine
room where the chief engineer and his mate, Germans it
seemed, gave enthusiastic information about the powerful twin
diesels and explained the hydraulics of the hydrofoil depressor—it
was all exactly like visiting any other ship and saying the
right things to the crew, using the right superlatives to the
owner.</p>

<p class="pindent">The short space of afterdeck was occupied by the little two-seater
amphibian, painted dark blue and white to match the
yacht, its wings now folded and its engine cowled against the
sun, a big jolly-boat to hold about twenty men, and an electric
derrick to hoist them in- and outboard. Bond, estimating the
ship’s displacement and her free-board, said casually, ‘And the
hold? More cabin space?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Just storage. And the fuel tanks of course. She is an expensive
ship to run. We have to carry several tons. The ballast
problem is important with these ships. When her bows come
up, the fuel shifts aft. We have to have big lateral tanks to
correct these things.’ Talking fluently and expertly Largo led
them back up the starboard passageway. They were about to
pass the radio room when Bond said. ‘You said you had ship-to-shore.
What else do you carry? The usual Marconi short and
long wave, I suppose. Could I have a look? Radio has always
fascinated me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo said politely, ‘Some other time, if you don’t mind. I’m
keeping the operator full time on met. reports. They’re rather
important to us at the moment.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They climbed up into the enclosed dome of the bridge,
where Largo briefly explained the controls and then led them
out on to the narrow deck space. ‘So there you are,’ said Largo.
‘The good ship <span class="it">Disco Volante</span>—the Flying Saucer. And she
really does fly, I can assure you. I hope you and Mr Larkin will
come for a short cruise one of these days. For the present,’ he
smiled with the hint of a secret shared, ‘as you may have heard,
we are rather busy.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Very exciting, this treasure business. Do you think you’ve
got a good chance?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We like to think so.’ Largo was deprecating. ‘I only wish I
could tell you more,’ he waved an apologetic hand. ‘Unfortunately,
as they say, my lips are sealed. I hope you will understand.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, of course. You have your shareholders to consider. I
only wish I was one so that I could come along. I suppose
there’s not room for another investor?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Alas no. The issue, as they say, is fully subscribed. It would
have been very pleasant to have had you with us.’ Largo held
out a hand. ‘Well, I see that Mr Larkin has been looking anxiously
at his watch during our brief tour. We must not keep Mr
Christie waiting any longer. It has been a great pleasure to meet
you, Mr Bond. And you, Mr Larkin.’</p>

<p class="pindent">With a further exchange of courtesies they went down the
ladder to the waiting launch and got under way. There was a
last wave from Mr Largo before he vanished through the hatch
to the bridge.</p>

<p class="pindent">They sat in the stern well away from the boatman. Leiter
shook his head. ‘Absolutely negative. Reaction around the
engine room and the radio room, but that’s normal. It was all
normal, damnably normal. What did you make of him and the
whole set-up?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Same as you—damned normal. He looks what he says he is,
and behaves that way. Not much crew about, but the ones we
saw were either ordinary crew or wonderful actors. Only two
small things struck me. There was no way down to the hold that
I could see, but of course it could have been a manhole under
the passage carpet. But then how do you get the stores he talked
of down there? And there’s the hell of a lot of space in that hold
even if I don’t know much about naval architecture. I’ll do a
check with the oiling wharf through the customs people and see
just how much fuel he does carry. Then it’s odd that we didn’t
see any of these shareholders. It was around three o’clock when
we went on board and most of them may have been having
siestas. But surely not all nineteen of them. What do they do in
their cabins all the time? Another small thing. Did you notice
that Largo didn’t smoke and that there was no trace of tobacco
smell anywhere in the ship? That’s odd. Around forty men and
not one of them is a smoker. If one had anything else to go on
one would say that wasn’t coincidence but discipline. The real
pros don’t drink or smoke. But I admit it’s a damned long shot.
Notice the Decca Navigator and the echo-sounder? Pretty expensive
bits of equipment both of them. Fairly normal on a big
yacht of course, but I’d have expected Largo to point them out
when he was showing us the bridge. Rich men are proud of their
toys. But that’s only clutching at straws. I’d have said the whole
outfit’s as clean as a whistle if it wasn’t for all that missing space,
we weren’t shown. That talk about fuel and ballast sounded a
bit glib to me. What do you think?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Same as you. There’s at least half of that ship we didn’t see.
But then again there’s a perfectly good answer to that. He may
have got a stack of secret treasure-hunting gear down there he
doesn’t want anyone to see. Remember that merchant ship off
Gibraltar during the war? The Italian frogmen used it as a base.
Big sort of trap door affair cut in the hull below the waterline.
I suppose he hasn’t got something like that?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked sharply at Leiter. ‘The <span class="it">Olterra</span>. One of the
blackest marks against Intelligence during the whole war.’ He
paused. ‘The <span class="it">Disco</span> was anchored in about forty feet of water.
Supposing they’d got the bombs buried in the sand below her.
Would your Geiger counter have registered?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Doubt it. I’ve got an underwater model and we could go and
have a sniff round when it gets dark. But really, James,’ Leiter
frowned impatiently, ‘aren’t we getting a bit off beam—seeing
burglars under the bed? We’ve got damn-all to go on. Largo’s a
powerful-looking piratical sort of chap, probably a bit of a crook
where women are concerned. But what the hell have we got
against him? Have you put a Trace through on him and on
these shareholders and the crew members?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes. Put them all on the wire from Government House,
Urgent Rates. We should get an answer by this evening. But
look here, Felix,’ Bond’s voice was stubborn, ‘there’s a damned
fast ship with a plane and forty men no one knows anything
about. There’s not another group or even an individual in the
area who looks in the least promising. All right, so the outfit
looks all right and its story seems to stand up. But just supposing
the whole thing was a phoney—a damned good one of
course, but then so it ought to be with all that’s at stake. Take
another look at the picture. These so-called shareholders all
arrive just in time for 3 June. On that night the <span class="it">Disco</span> goes to
sea and stays out till morning. Just supposing she rendezvous’d
that plane in shallow water somewhere. Just suppose she
picked up the bombs and put them away—in the sand
under the ship, if you like. Anyway, somewhere safe and
convenient. Just suppose all that and what sort of a picture
do you get?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A B picture so far as I’m concerned, James.’ Leiter shrugged
resignedly. ‘But I guess there’s just enough to make it a lead.’
He laughed sardonically. ‘But I’d rather shoot myself than put
it in tonight’s report. If we’re going to make fools of ourselves,
we’d better do it well out of sight and sound of our chiefs. So
what’s on your mind? What comes next?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘While you get our communications going, I’m going to check
with the oiling wharf. Then we’ll call up this Domino girl and
try and get ourselves asked for a drink and have a quick look at
Largo’s shore base—this Palmyra. Then we go to the casino and
look over the whole of Largo’s group. And then,’ Bond looked
stubbornly at Leiter, ‘I’m going to borrow a good man from the
Police Commissioner to give me a hand, put on an aqualung
and go out and have a sniff round the <span class="it">Disco</span> with your other
Geiger machine.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter said laconically, ‘Destry Rides Again! Well, I’ll go
along with that, James. Just for old times’ sake. But don’t go
and stub your toe on a sea-urchin or anything. I see there are
free Cha-cha lessons in the ballroom of the Royal Bahamian
tomorrow. We’ve got to keep fit for those. I guess there’ll be
nothing else in this trip for my memory book.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Back in the hotel, a dispatch rider from Government House
was waiting for Bond. He saluted smartly, handed over an
<span class="s">OHMS</span> envelope and got Bond’s signed receipt in exchange.
It was a cable from the Colonial Office ‘Personal to the Governor.’
The text was prefixed <span class="g">PROBOND</span>. The cable read: ‘<span class="g">YOUR
1107 RECORDS HAVE NOTHING REPEAT NOTHING ON
THESE NAMES STOP INFORMATIVELY ALL STATIONS
REPORT NEGATIVELY ON OPERATION THUNDERBALL
STOP WHAT HAVE YOU QUERY</span>. The message was signed
‘<span class="g">PRISM</span>’ which meant that M had approved it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond handed the cable to Leiter.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter read it. He said, ‘See what I mean? We’re on a bum
steer. This is a thumb-twiddler. See you later in the Pineapple
Bar for a dry Martini that’s half a jumbo olive. I’ll go send a
post-card to Washington and ask them to send down a couple
of <span class="g">WAVES</span>. We’re going to have time on our hands.’</p>
