<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Nassau Casino</span> used to be the only legal casino on
British soil anywhere in the world. How this was justified
under the laws of the Commonwealth no one can quite figure. It
is leased each year to a Canadian gambling syndicate and their
operating profits in the smart winter season are estimated to
average around $100,000. The only games played are roulette,
with two zeros instead of one, which increased the take to the
house from the European 3·6 to a handsome 5·4; black jack, or
21, on which the house makes between six and seven per cent;
and one table of chemin de fer, whose cagnotte yields a modest
five per cent. The operation is run as a club in a handsome
private house on West Bay Street and there is a pleasant dance
and supper room with a three-piece combo that plays old
favourites in strict time, and a lounge bar. It is a well run,
elegant place that deserves its profit.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Governor’s <span class="s">ADC</span> had presented Bond and Leiter with
membership cards, and after they had had coffee and a stinger
at the bar they separated and went to the tables.</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo was playing chemin de fer. He had a fat pile of
hundred-dollar plaques in front of him and half a dozen of the
big yellow thousand-dollar biscuits. Domino Vitali sat behind
him chain-smoking and watching the play. Bond observed the
game from a distance. Largo was playing expansively, bancoing
whenever he could and letting his own banks run. He was
winning steadily, but with excellent manners, and by the way
people joked with him and applauded his coups he was obviously
a favourite in the Casino. Domino, in black with a square-cut
neckline and with one large diamond on a thin chain at her
throat, was looking morose and bored. The woman on Largo’s
right, having bancoed him three times and lost, got up and left
the table. Bond went quickly across the room and slid into the
empty place. It was a bank of eight hundred dollars—the round
sum being due to Largo making up the cagnotte after each play.</p>

<p class="pindent">It is good for the banker when he has got past the third banco.
It often means the bank is going to run. Bond knew this perfectly
well. He was also painfully aware that his total capital
was only 1,000 dollars. But the fact that everyone was so
nervous of Largo’s luck made him bold. And, after all, the table
has no memory. Luck, he told himself, is strictly for the birds.
He said, ‘Banco.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ah my good friend Mr Bond,’ Largo held out a hand. ‘Now
we have the big money coming to the table. Perhaps I should
pass the bank. The English know how to play at railway trains.
But still,’ he smiled charmingly, ‘if I have to lose I would
certainly like to lose to Mr Bond.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The big brown hand gave the shoe a soft slap. Largo eased
out the pink tongue of playing card and moved it across the
baize to Bond. He took one for himself and then pressed out one
more for each of them. Bond picked up his first card and flicked
it face up into the middle of the table. It was a nine, the nine
of diamonds. Bond glanced sideways at Largo. He said, ‘That
is always a good start—so good that I will also face my second
card.’ He casually flicked it out to join the nine. It turned over
in mid-air and fell beside the nine. It was a glorious ten, the
ten of spades. Unless Largo’s two cards also added up to nine
or nineteen, Bond had won.</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo laughed, but the laugh had a hard edge to it. ‘You
certainly make me try,’ he said gaily. He threw his cards to
follow Bond’s. They were the eight of hearts and the king of
clubs. Largo had lost by a pip—two naturals, but one just
better than the other, the cruellest way to lose. Largo laughed
hugely. ‘Somebody had to be second,’ he said to the table at
large. ‘What did I say? The English can pull what they like
out of the shoe.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The croupier pushed the chips across to Bond. Bond made a
small pile of them. He gestured at the heap in front of Largo:
‘So, it seems, can the Italians. I told you this afternoon we
should go into partnership.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo laughed delightedly. ‘Well, let’s just try once again.
Put in what you have won and I will banco it in partnership
with Mr Snow on your right. Yes, Mr Snow?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Snow, a tough-looking European who, Bond remembered,
was one of the shareholders, agreed. Bond put in the
eight hundred and they each put in four against him. Bond
won again, this time with a six against a five for the table—once
more by one point.</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo shook his head mournfully. ‘Now indeed we have seen
the writing on the wall. Mr Snow, you will have to continue
alone. This Mr Bond has green fingers against me. I surrender.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Now Largo was smiling only with his mouth. Mr Snow
suivied and pushed forward 1,600 dollars to cover Bond’s stake.
Bond thought: I have made 1,600 dollars in two coups, over five
hundred pounds. And it would be fun to pass the bank and for
the bank to go down on the next hand. He withdrew his stake
and said, ‘La main passe.’ There was a buzz of comment. Largo
said dramatically, ‘Don’t do it to me! Don’t tell me the bank’s
going to go down on the next hand! If it does I shoot myself.
Okay, okay, I will buy Mr Bond’s bank and we will see.’ He
threw some plaques out on to the table—1,600 dollars’ worth.</p>

<p class="pindent">And Bond heard his own voice say banco! He was bancoing
his own bank—telling Largo that he had done it to him once,
then twice, and now he was going to do it, inevitably again!</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo turned round to face Bond. Smiling with his mouth,
he narrowed his eyes and looked carefully, with a new curiosity,
at Bond’s face. He said quietly, ‘But you are hunting me, my
dear fellow. You are pursuing me. What is this? Vendetta?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond thought, I will see if an association of words does
something to him. He said, ‘When I came to the table I saw a
spectre.’ He said the word casually, with no hint at double
meaning.</p>

<p class="pindent">The smile came off Largo’s face as if he had been slapped. It
was at once switched on again, but now the whole face was
tense, strained, and the eyes had gone watchful and very hard.
His tongue came out and touched his lips. ‘Really? What do
you mean?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said lightly, ‘The spectre of defeat. I thought your luck
was on the turn. Perhaps I was wrong.’ He gestured at the shoe.
‘Let’s see.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The table had gone quiet. The players and spectators felt
that a tension had come between these two men. Suddenly
there was the smell of enmity where before there had been only
jokes. A glove had been thrown down, by the Englishman.
Was it about the girl? Probably. The crowd licked its
lips.</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo laughed sharply. He switched gaiety and bravado back
on his face. ‘Aha!’ His voice was boisterous again, ‘My friend
wishes to put the evil eye upon my cards. We have a way to deal
with that where I come from.’ He lifted a hand, and with only
the first and little fingers outstretched in a fork, he prodded
once, like a snake striking, towards Bond’s face. To the crowd
it was a playful piece of theatre, but Bond, within the strong
aura of the man’s animal magnetism, felt the ill-temper, the
malevolence behind the old Mafia gesture.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed good-naturedly. ‘That certainly put the hex on
me. But what did it do to the cards? Come on, your spectre
against my spectre!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Again the look of doubt came over Largo’s face. Why again
the use of this word? He gave the shoe a hefty slap. ‘All right,
my friend. We are wrestling the best of three falls. Here comes
the third.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Quickly his first two fingers licked out the four cards. The
table had hushed. Bond faced his pair inside his hand. He had a
total of five—a ten of clubs and a five of hearts. Five is a
marginal number. One can either draw or not. Bond folded the
cards face down on the table. He said, with the confident look
of a man who has a six or a seven, ‘No card, thank you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo’s eyes narrowed as he tried to read Bond’s face. He
turned up his cards, flicked them into the middle of the table
with a gesture of disgust. He also had a count of five. Now what
was he to do? Draw or not draw? He looked again at the quiet
smile of confidence on Bond’s face—and drew. It was a nine,
the nine of spades. By drawing another card instead of standing
on his five and equalling Bond, he had drawn and now had
a four to Bond’s five.</p>

<p class="pindent">Impassively Bond turned up his cards. He said, ‘I’m afraid
you should have killed the evil eye in the pack, not in me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a buzz of comment round the table. ‘But if the
Italian had stood on his five . . .’ ‘I always draw on a five.’ ‘I
never do.’ ‘It was bad luck.’ ‘No, it was bad play.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Now it was an effort for Largo to keep the snarl off his face.
But he managed it, the forced smile lost its twist, the balled fists
relaxed. He took a deep breath and held out his hand to Bond.
Bond took it, folding his thumb inside his palm just in case
Largo might give him a bone-crusher with his vast machine-tool
of a hand. But it was a firm grasp and no more. Largo said,
‘Now I must wait for the shoe to come round again. You have
taken all my winnings. I have a hard evening’s work ahead of
me just when I was going to take my niece for a drink and a
dance.’ He turned to Domino. ‘My dear, I don’t think you
know Mr Bond, except on the telephone. I’m afraid he has
upset my plans. You must find someone else to squire you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, ‘How do you do. Didn’t we meet in the tobacconist’s
this morning?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl screwed up her eyes. She said indifferently, ‘Yes? It
is possible. I have such a bad memory for faces.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, ‘Well, could I give you a drink? I can just afford
even a Nassau drink now, thanks to the generosity of Mr Largo.
And I have finished here. This sort of thing can’t last. I mustn’t
press my luck.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl got up. She said ungraciously, ‘If you have nothing
better to do.’ She turned to Largo: ‘Emilio, perhaps if I take
this Mr Bond away, your luck will turn again. I will be in the
supper room having caviar and champagne. We must try and
get as much of your funds as we can back in the family.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo laughed. His spirits had returned. He said. ‘You see,
Mr Bond, you are out of the frying pan into the fire. In Dominetta’s
hands you may not fare so well as in mine. See you later,
my dear fellow. I must now get back to the salt mines where
you have consigned me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, ‘Well, thanks for the game. I will order champagne
and caviar for three. My spectre also deserves his
reward.’ Wondering again whether the shadow that flickered in
Largo’s eyes at the word had more significance than Italian
superstition, he got up and followed the girl between the
crowded tables to the supper room.</p>

<p class="pindent">Domino made for a shadowed table in the farthest corner of
the room. Walking behind her, Bond noticed for the first
time that she had the smallest trace of a limp. He found it
endearing, a touch of childish sweetness beneath the authority
and blatant sex appeal of a girl to whom he had been inclined to
award that highest, but toughest, French title—a <span class="it">courtisane
de marque</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">When the Clicquot rosé and fifty dollars’ worth of Beluga
caviar came—anything less, he had commented to her, would
be no more than a spoonful—he asked her about the limp. ‘Did
you hurt yourself swimming today?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked at him gravely. ‘No. I have one leg an inch shorter
than the other. Does it displease you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No. It’s pretty. It makes you something of a child.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Instead of a hard old kept woman. Yes?’ Her eyes challenged
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Is that how you see yourself?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s rather obvious isn’t it? Anyway, it’s what everyone in
Nassau thinks.’ She looked him squarely in the eyes, but with a
touch of pleading.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nobody’s told me that. Anyway, I make up my own mind
about men and women. What’s the good of other people’s
opinions? Animals don’t consult each other about other
animals. They look and sniff and feel. In love and hate, and
everything in between, those are the only tests that matter. But
people are unsure of their own instincts. They want reassurance.
So they ask someone else whether they should like a
particular person or not. And as the world loves bad news, they
nearly always get a bad answer—or at least a qualified one.
Would you like to know what I think of you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She smiled. ‘Every woman likes to hear about herself. Tell
me, but make it sound true, otherwise I shall stop listening.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I think you’re a young girl, younger than you pretend to be,
younger than you dress. I think you were carefully brought up,
in a red carpet sort of way, and then the red carpet was suddenly
jerked away from under your feet and you were thrown
more or less into the street. So you picked yourself up and
started to work your way back to the red carpet you had got
used to. You were probably fairly ruthless about it. You had to
be. You only had a woman’s weapons and you probably used
them pretty coolly. I expect you used your body. It would be a
wonderful asset. But in using it to get what you wanted, your
sensibilities had to be put aside. I don’t expect they’re very far
underground. They certainly haven’t atrophied. They’ve just
lost their voice because you wouldn’t listen to them. You
couldn’t afford to listen to them if you were to get back on that
red carpet and have the things you wanted. And now you’ve got
the things.’ Bond touched the hand that lay on the banquette
between them. ‘And perhaps you’ve almost had enough of
them.’ He laughed. ‘But I mustn’t get too serious. Now about
the smaller things. You know all about them, but just for the
record, you’re beautiful, sexy, provocative, independent, self-willed,
quick-tempered, and cruel.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked at him thoughtfully. ‘There’s nothing very clever
about all that. I told you most of it. You know something about
Italian women. But why do you say I’m cruel?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If I was gambling and I took a knock like Largo did and I
had my woman, a woman, sitting near me watching and she
didn’t give me one word of comfort or encouragement I would
say she was being cruel. Men don’t like failing in front of their
women.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She said impatiently, ‘I’ve had to sit there too often and
watch him show off. I wanted you to win. I cannot pretend.
You didn’t mention my only virtue. It’s honesty. I love to the
hilt and I hate to the hilt. At the present time, with Emilio, I
am half way. Where we were lovers, we are now good friends
who understand each other. When I told you he was my
guardian, I was telling a white lie. I am his kept woman. I am a
bird in a gilded cage. I am fed up with my cage and tired of my
bargain.’ She looked at Bond defensively. ‘Yes, it is cruel for
Emilio. But it is also human. You can buy the outside of the
body, but you cannot buy what is inside—what people call the
heart and soul. But Emilio knows that. He wants women for
use. Not for love. He has had thousands in this way. He knows
where we both stand. He is realistic. But it is becoming more
difficult to keep to my bargain—to, to, let’s call it sing for
my supper.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She stopped abruptly. She said, ‘Give me some more
champagne. All this silly talking has made me thirsty. And I
would like a packet of Players’—she laughed—‘Please, as they
say in the advertisements. I am fed up with just smoking smoke.
I need my Hero.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond bought a packet from the cigarette girl. He said,
‘What’s that about a hero?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She had entirely changed. Her bitterness had gone, and the
lines of strain on her face. She had softened. She was suddenly
a girl out for the evening. ‘Ah, you don’t know! My one true
love! The man of my dreams. The sailor on the front of the
packet of Players. You have never thought about him as I
have.’ She came closer to him on the banquette and held the
packet under his eyes. ‘You don’t understand the romance of
this wonderful picture—one of the great masterpieces of the
world. This man,’ she pointed, ‘was the first man I ever sinned
with. I took him into the woods, I loved him in the dormitory,
I spent nearly all my pocket money on him. In exchange, he
introduced me to the great world outside the Cheltenham
Ladies College. He grew me up. He put me at ease with boys of
my own age. He kept me company when I was lonely or afraid
of being young. He encouraged me, gave me assurance. Have
you never thought of the romance behind this picture? You see
nothing, yet the whole of England is there! Listen,’ she took
his arm eagerly, ‘this is the story of Hero, the name on his cap
badge. At first he was a young man, a powder monkey or
whatever they called it, in that sailing ship behind his right ear.
It was a hard time for him. Weevils in the biscuits, hit with
marlinspikes and ropes’ ends and things, sent up aloft to the top
of all that rigging where the flag flies. But he persevered. He
began to grow a moustache. He was fair-haired and rather too
pretty,’ she giggled, ‘he may even have had to fight for his
virtue, or whatever men call it, among all those hammocks.
But you can see from his face—that line of concentration between
his eyes—and from his fine head, that he was a man to
get on.’ She paused and swallowed a glass of champagne. The
dimples were now deep holes in her cheeks. ‘Are you listening
to me? You are not bored having to listen about my hero?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m only jealous. Go on.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So he went all over the world—to India, China, Japan,
America. He had many girls and many fights with cutlasses and
fists. He wrote home regularly—to his mother and to a married
sister who lived at Dover. They wanted him to come home and
meet a nice girl and get married. But he wouldn’t. You see, he
was keeping himself for a dream girl who looked rather like me.
And then,’ she laughed, ‘the first steamships came in and he
was transferred to an ironclad—that’s the picture of it on the
right. And by now he was a bosun, whatever that is, and very
important. And he saved up from his pay and instead of going
out fighting and having girls he grew that lovely beard, to make
himself look older and more important, and he set to with a
needle and coloured threads to make that picture of himself.
You can see how well he did it—his first windjammer and his
last ironclad with the lifebuoy as a frame. He only finished it
when he decided to leave the Navy. He didn’t really like
steamships. In the prime of life, don’t you agree? And even
then he ran out of gold thread to finish the rope round the
lifebuoy, so he just had to tail it off. There, you can see on the
right where the rope crosses the blue line. So he came back
home on a beautiful golden evening after a wonderful life in
the Navy and it was so sad and beautiful and romantic that he
decided that he would put the beautiful evening into another
picture. So he bought a pub at Bristol with his savings and in
the mornings before the pub opened he worked away until he
had finished and there you can see the little sailing ship that
brought him home from Suez with his duffel bag full of silks
and seashells and souvenirs carved out of wood. And that’s the
Needles Lighthouse beckoning him in to harbour on that
beautiful calm evening. Mark you,’ she frowned, ‘I don’t like
that sort of bonnet thing he’s wearing for a hat, and I’d have
liked him to have put “<span class="s">HMS</span>” before the “<span class="it">Hero</span>”, but you
can see that would have made it lop-sided and he wouldn’t
have been able to get all the “<span class="it">Hero</span>” in. But you must admit it’s
the most terrifically romantic picture. I cut it off my first packet,
when I smoked one in the lavatory and felt terribly sick, and
kept it until it fell to pieces. Then I cut off a fresh one. I carried
him with me always until things went wrong and I had to go
back to Italy. Then I couldn’t afford Players. They’re too
expensive in Italy and I had to smoke things called Nazionales.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond wanted to keep her mood. He said, ‘But what happened
to the hero’s pictures? How did the cigarette people get
hold of them?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh well, you see one day a man with a stove-pipe hat and a
frock coat came into the hero’s pub with two small boys. Here,’
she held the packet sideways, ‘those are the ones, “John Player
&amp; Sons”. You see, it says that their Successors run the business
now. Well, they had one of the first motor-cars, a Rolls-Royce,
and it had broken down outside the hero’s pub. The man in the
stove-pipe hat didn’t drink of course—those sort of people
didn’t, not the respectable merchants who lived near Bristol. So
he asked for ginger beer and bread and cheese while his
chauffeur mended the car. And the hero got it for them. And
Mr John Player and the boys all admired the two wonderful
tapestry pictures hanging on the wall of the pub. Now this Mr
Player was in the tobacco and snuff business and cigarettes had
just been invented and he wanted to start making them. But he
couldn’t for the life of him know what to call them or what sort
of a picture to put on the packet. And he suddenly had a
wonderful idea. When he got back to the factory he talked to
his manager and the manager came along to the pub and saw
the hero and offered him a hundred pounds to let his two
pictures be copied for the cigarette packet. And the hero didn’t
mind and anyway he wanted just exactly a hundred pounds to
get married on.’ She paused. Her eyes were far away. ‘She was
very nice, by the way, only thirty and a good plain cook and her
young body kept him warm in bed until he died many years
later. And she bore him two children, a boy and a girl. And
the boy went into the Navy like his father. Well, anyway, Mr
Player wanted to have the hero in the lifebuoy on one side of
the packet and the beautiful evening on the other. But the
manager pointed out that that would leave no room for all
this’—she turned over the packet—‘about “Rich, Cool”,
and “Navy Cut Tobacco” and that extraordinary trade mark
of a doll’s house swimming in chocolate fudge with Nottingham
Castle written underneath. So then Mr Player said, “Well
then, we’ll put one on top of the other.” And that’s just exactly
what they did and I must say I think it fits in very well, don’t
you? Though I expect the hero was pretty annoyed at the
mermaid being blanked out.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The mermaid?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh yes. Underneath the bottom corner of the lifebuoy
where it dips into the sea, the hero had put a tiny mermaid
combing her hair with one hand and beckoning him home with
the other. That was supposed to be the woman he was going to
find and marry. But you can see there wasn’t room and anyway
her breasts were showing and Mr Player, who was a very strong
Quaker, didn’t think that was quite proper. But he made it up
to the Hero in the end.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, how did he do that?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well you see the cigarettes were a great success. It was really
the picture that did it. People decided that anything with a
wonderful picture like that on the outside must be good and Mr
Player made a fortune and I expect his Successors did too. So
when the hero was getting old and hadn’t got long to live, Mr
Player had a copy of the lifebuoy picture drawn by the finest
artist of the day. It was just the same as the Hero’s except that it
wasn’t in colour and it showed him very much older, and he
promised the Hero that this picture too would always be on his
cigarette packets, only on the inside bit. Here.’ She pushed out
the cardboard container. ‘You see how old he looks? And one
other thing, if you look closely, the flags on the two ships are
flying at half mast. Rather sweet of Mr Player, don’t you think,
to ask the artist for that. It meant that the Hero’s first and last
ships were remembering him. And Mr Player and his two sons
came and presented it to him just before he died. It must have
made it much easier for him, don’t you think?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It certainly must. Mr Player must have been a very
thoughtful man.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl was slowly returning from her dreamland. She said
in a different, rather prim voice, ‘Well, thank you anyway for
having listened to the story. I know it’s all a fairy tale. At least I
suppose it is. But children are stupid in that way. They like to
have something to keep under the pillow until they’re quite
grown up—a rag doll or a small toy or something. I know that
boys are just the same. My brother hung on to a little metal
charm his nanny had given him until he was nineteen. Then he
lost it. I shall never forget the scenes he made. Even though he
was in the air force by then and it was the middle of the war.
He said it brought him luck.’ She shrugged her shoulders. There
was sarcasm in her voice as she said, ‘He needn’t have worried.
He did all right. He was much older than me, but I adored him.
I still do. Girls always love crooks, particularly if they’re their
brother. He did so well that he might have done something for
me. But he never did. He said that life was every man for himself.
He said that his grandfather had been so famous as a
poacher and a smuggler in the Dolomites that his was the finest
tombstone among all the Petacchi graves in the graveyard at
Bolzano. My brother said he was going to have a finer one still,
and by making money the same way.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond held his cigarette steady. He took a long draw at it and
let the smoke out with a quiet hiss. ‘Is your family name
Petacchi then?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh yes. Vitali is only a stage name. It sounded better so I
changed it. Nobody knows the other. I’ve almost forgotten it
myself. I’ve called myself Vitali since I came back to Italy. I
wanted to change everything.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What happened to your brother? What was his first name?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Giuseppe. He went wrong in various ways. But he was a
wonderful flyer. Last time I heard of him he’d been given some
high-up job in Paris. Perhaps that’ll make him settle down. I
pray every night that it will. He’s all I’ve got. I love him in spite
of everything. You understand that?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stabbed out his cigarette in the ashtray. He called for
the bill. He said, ‘Yes, I understand that.’</p>
