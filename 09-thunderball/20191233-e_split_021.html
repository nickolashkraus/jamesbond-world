<h3 class="calibre10"><span class="it1">Sour Martinis</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">A</span>s</span> <span class="lead-in">it turned out</span>, the first half of Bond’s programme
for the evening went by the board. On the telephone,
Domino Vitali said that it would not be convenient for them
to see the house that evening. Her guardian and some of his
friends were coming ashore. Yes it was indeed possible that
they might meet at the Casino that evening. She would be
dining on board and the <span class="it">Disco</span> would then sail round and anchor
off the Casino. But how would she be able to recognize him
in the Casino? She had a very poor memory for faces. Would
he perhaps wear a flower in his buttonhole or something?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had laughed. He said that would be all right. He would
remember her by her beautiful blue eyes. They were unforgettable.
And the blue rinse that matched them. He had put the
receiver down half-way through the amused, sexy chuckle. He
suddenly wanted to see her again very much.</p>

<p class="pindent">But the movement of the ship altered his plans for the better.
It would be much easier to reconnoitre her in the harbour. It
would be a shorter swim and he would be able to go into the
water under cover of the harbour police wharf. Equally, with
her anchorage empty, it would be all the easier to survey the
area where she had been lying. But if Largo moved the yacht
about so nonchalantly was it likely the bombs, if there were any,
would be hidden at the anchorage? If they were, surely the
<span class="it">Disco</span> would stand watch over them. Bond decided to put a
decision aside until he had more, and more expert, information
about the ship’s hull.</p>

<p class="pindent">He sat in his room and wrote his negative report to M. He
read it through. It would be a depressing signal to get. Should
he say anything about the wisp of a lead he was working on?
No. Not until he had something solid. Wishful intelligence, the
desire to please or reassure the recipient, was the most dangerous
commodity in the whole realm of secret information. Bond
could imagine the reaction in Whitehall where the <span class="it">Thunderball</span>
war-room would be ready, anxious to grasp at straws. M’s
careful ‘I think we may conceivably have got a lead in the
Bahamas. Absolutely nothing definite, but this particular man
doesn’t often go wrong on these things. Yes, certainly I’ll check
back and see if we can get a follow-up.’ And the buzz would get
around: ‘M’s on to something. Agent of his thinks he’s got a
lead. The Bahamas. Yes, I think we’d better tell the P M.’ Bond
shuddered. The <span class="g">MOST IMMEDIATES</span> would pour in to him:
‘Elucidate your 1806.’ ‘Flash fullest details.’ ‘Premier wants
detailed grounds for your 1806.’ There would be no end to the
flood. Leiter would get the same from <span class="s">CIA</span>. The whole place
would be in an uproar. Then, in answer to Bond’s tatty little
fragments of gossip and speculation, there would come the
blistering: ‘Surprised you should take this flimsy evidence
seriously. Futurely confine your signals to facts,’ and, the
final degradation, ‘View speculative nature your 1806 and
subsequents comma future signals must repeat must be joint
and countersigned by <span class="s">CIA</span> representative.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond wiped his forehead. He unlocked the case containing
his cipher machine, transposed his text, checked it again and
went off to Police Headquarters where Leiter was sitting at his
keyboard, the sweat of concentration pouring down his neck.
Ten minutes later Leiter took off his earphones and handed
over to Bond. He mopped his face with an already drenched
handkerchief. ‘First it’s sunspots and I had to swap over to the
emergency wavelength. There I found they’d put a baboon on
the other end—you know, one of the ones that can write the
whole of Shakespeare if you leave him at it long enough.’ He
angrily waved several pages of cipher groups. ‘Now I’ve got to
unscramble all this. Probably from Accounts about how much
extra income tax this sunshine trip will cost me.’ He sat down
at a table and began cranking away at his machine.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond put his short message over quickly. He could see it
being punched out on the tapes in one of those busy rooms on
the eighth floor, going to the supervisor, being marked ‘Personal
for M. copy to OO Section and Records’, then another girl
hurrying off down the passage with the flimsy yellow forms on
a clip file. He queried whether there was anything for him and
signed off. He left Leiter and went down to the Commissioner’s
room.</p>

<p class="pindent">Harling was sitting at his desk with his coat off, dictating to a
police sergeant. He dismissed him, pushed a box of cigarettes
over his desk to Bond and lit one himself. He smiled quizzically.
‘Any progress?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond told him that the Trace on the Largo group had been
negative and that they had called on Largo and gone over the
<span class="it">Disco</span> with a Geiger counter. This also had been negative. Bond
still wasn’t satisfied. He told the Commissioner what he wanted
to know about the fuel capacity of the <span class="it">Disco</span> and the exact location
of the fuel tanks. The Commissioner nodded amiably and
picked up the telephone. He asked for a Sergeant Molony of the
Harbour Police. He cradled the receiver and explained, ‘We
check all fuelling. This is a narrow harbour crammed with small
craft, deep-sea fishing boats and so on. Quite a fire hazard if
something went wrong. We like to know what everyone is
carrying and whereabouts in the ship. Just in case there’s some
fire-fighting to be done or we want a particular ship to get out of
range in a hurry.’ He went back to the telephone. ‘Sergeant
Molony?’ He repeated Bond’s questions, listened, said thank you,
and put the receiver down. ‘She carries a maximum of 500
gallons of diesel. Took that amount in on the afternoon
of 2 June. She also carries about forty gallons of lubricating
oil and a hundred gallons of drinking water—all carried
amidships just for’ard of the engine room. That what you
want?’</p>

<p class="pindent">This made nonsense of Largo’s talk of lateral tanks and the
difficult ballast problem and so forth. Of course he could have
wanted to keep some secret treasure-hunting gear out of sight
of the visitors, but at least there <span class="it">was</span> something on board he
wanted to hide, and, for all his show of openness, it was now
established that Mr Largo might be a rich treasure hunter, but
he was also an unreliable witness. Now Bond’s mind was made
up. It was the hull of the ship he wanted to have a look at.
Leiter’s mention of the <span class="it">Olterra</span> had been a long shot, but it just
might pay off.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond passed on a guarded version of his thoughts to the
Commissioner. He told him where the <span class="it">Disco</span> would be lying
that night. Was there on the force a totally reliable man who
could give him a hand with his underwater recce, and was there
a sound aqualung, fully charged, available?</p>

<p class="pindent">Harling gently asked if this was wise. He didn’t exactly know
the laws of trespass, but these seemed to be good citizens and
they were certainly good spenders. Largo was very popular with
everyone. Any kind of scandal, particularly if the police was
involved, would create the hell of a stink in the Colony.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said firmly, ‘I’m sorry. Commissioner. I quite see your
point. But these risks have to be run and I’ve got a job to do.
Surely the Secretary of State’s instructions are sufficient
authority,’ Bond fired his broadside, ‘I could get specific orders
from him, or from the Prime Minister for the matter of that, in
about an hour if you feel it’s necessary.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Commissioner shook his head. He smiled. ‘No need to
use the big guns, Commander. Of course you shall have what
you want. I was just giving you the local reaction. I’m sure the
Governor would have given you the same warning. This is a
small puddle here. We’re not used to the crash treatment from
Whitehall. No doubt we’ll get used to it if this flap lasts long
enough. Now then. Yes, we’ve got plenty of what you want.
We’ve got twenty men in the Harbour Salvage Unit. Have to.
You’d be surprised how often a small boat gets wrecked in the
fairway, just where some cruise ship’s going to anchor. And of
course there’s the occasional body. I’ll have Constable Santos
assigned to you. Splendid chap. Native of Eleuthera, where he
used to win all the swimming prizes. He’ll have the gear you
want where you want it. Now just give me the details . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">Back in his hotel, Bond took a shower, swallowed a double
Bourbon Old Fashioned and threw himself down on his bed.
He felt absolutely beat—the plane trip, the heat, the nagging
sense that he was making a fool of himself in front of the Commissioner,
in front of Leiter, in front of himself, added to the
dangers, and probably futile ones at that, of this ugly night
swim, had built up tensions that could only be eased by sleep
and solitude. He went out like a light—to dream of Domino
being pursued by a shark with dazzling white teeth that suddenly
became Largo, Largo who turned on him with those
huge hands. They were coming closer, they reached slowly for
him, they had him by the shoulder . . . But then the bell rang
for the end of the round, and went on ringing.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond reached out a drugged hand for the receiver. It was
Leiter. He wanted that Martini with the jumbo olive. It was
nine o’clock. What the hell was Bond doing? Did he want
someone to help with the zip?</p>

<p class="pindent">The Pineapple Room was panelled in bamboo carefully
varnished against termites. Wrought iron pineapples on the
tables and against the wall contained segments of thick red
candle, and more light was provided by illuminated aquaria let
into the walls and by ceiling lights enclosed in pink glass starfish.
The Vinylite banquettes were in ivory white and the barman
and the two waiters wore scarlet satin calypso shirts with
their black trousers.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond joined Leiter at a corner table. They both wore white
dinner jackets with their dress trousers. Bond had pointed up
his rich, property-seeking status with a wine-red cummerbund.
Leiter laughed. ‘I nearly tied a gold-plated bicycle chain round
my waist in case of trouble, but I remembered just in time that
I’m a peaceful lawyer. I suppose it’s right that you should get
the girls on this assignment. I suppose I just stand by and
arrange the marriage settlement and later the alimony. Waiter!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter ordered two dry Martinis. ‘Just watch,’ he said sourly.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Martinis arrived. Leiter took one look at them and told
the waiter to send over the barman. When the barman came,
looking resentful, Leiter said, ‘My friend, I asked for a Martini
and not a soused olive.’ He picked the olive out of the glass with
the cocktail stick. The glass, that had been three-quarters full,
was now half full. Leiter said mildly. ‘This was being done to
me while the only drink you knew was milk. I’d learned the
basic economics of your business by the time you’d graduated
to Coca Cola. One bottle of Gordon’s Gin contains sixteen true
measures—double measures that is, the only ones I drink. Cut
the gin with three ounces of water and that makes it up to
twenty-two. Have a jigger glass with a big steal in the bottom
and a bottle of these fat olives and you’ve got around twenty-eight
measures. Bottle of gin here costs only two dollars retail,
let’s say around a dollar sixty wholesale. You charge eighty
cents for a Martini, one dollar sixty for two. Same price as a
whole bottle of gin. And with your twenty-eight measures to
the bottle, you’ve still got twenty-six left. That’s a clear profit
on one bottle of gin of around twenty-one dollars. Give you a
dollar for the olives and the drop of vermouth and you’ve still
got twenty dollars in your pocket. Now, my friend, that’s too
much profit, and if I could be bothered to take this Martini to
the management and then to the Tourist Board, you’d be in
trouble. Be a good chap and mix us two large dry Martinis
without olives and with some slices of lemon peel separate.
Okay? Right, then we’re friends again.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The barman’s face had run through indignation, respect and
then the sullenness of guilt and fear. Reprieved, but clutching
at his scraps of professional dignity, he snapped his fingers for
the waiter to take away the glasses. ‘Okay, suh. Whatever you
says. But we’ve got plenty overheads here and the majority of
customers they doan complain.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter said, ‘Well, here’s one who’s dry behind the ears. A
good barman should learn to be able to recognize the serious
drinker from the status-seeker who wants just to be seen in
your fine bar.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yassuh.’ The barman moved away with Negro dignity.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, ‘You got those figures right, Felix? I always knew
one got clipped, but I thought only about a hundred per cent—not
four or five.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Young man, since I graduated from Government service to
Pinkertons, the scales have dropped from my eyes. The cheating
that goes on in hotels and restaurants is more sinful than all
the rest of the sin in the world. Anyone in a tuxedo before
seven in the evening is a crocodile, and if he couldn’t take a
good bite at your pocketbook he’d take a good bite at your ear.
The same goes for the rest of the consumer business, even when
it’s not wearing a tuxedo. Sometimes it gets me real mad to
have to eat and drink the muck you get and then see what
you’re charged for it. Look at our damned lunch today.
Six, seven bucks with fifteen per cent added for what’s called
service. And then the waiter hangs about for another fifty
cents for riding up in the elevator with the stuff. Hell,’
Leiter ran an angry hand through his mop of straw hair, ‘just
don’t let’s talk about it. I’m fit to bust a gut when I think
about it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The drinks came. They were excellent. Leiter calmed down
and ordered a second round. He said, ‘Now let’s get angry
about something else.’ He laughed curtly. ‘Guess I’m just sore
at being back in Government Service again watching all the
taxpayers’ money going down the drain on this wild goose
chase. Mark you, James,’ there was apology in Leiter’s voice,
‘I’m not saying this whole operation isn’t a true bill, hell of
a mess in fact, but what riles me is that we should be a couple
of arse-end Charlies stuck down on this sand-pit while the
other guys have got the hot spots—you know, places where
something really may be happening—or at least likely to
happen. Tell you the truth, I felt like a damned fool gumshoeing
round that feller’s yacht this afternoon with my little
Geiger toy.’ He looked keenly at Bond. ‘You don’t find you
grow out of these things? I mean it’s all right when there’s a
war on. But it seems kinda childish when peace is bustin’ out
all over.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said doubtfully, ‘Of course I know what you mean,
Felix. Perhaps it’s just that in England we don’t feel quite as
secure as you do in America. The war just doesn’t seem to have
ended for us—Berlin, Cyprus, Kenya, Suez, let alone these
jobs with people like <span class="g">SMERSH</span> that I used to get tangled up in.
There always seems to be something boiling up somewhere.
Now this damned business. Dare say I’m taking it all too seriously,
but there’s something fishy going on around here. I
checked up on that fuel problem and Largo certainly told us a
lie.’ Bond gave the details of what he had learned at police
headquarters. ‘I feel I’ve got to make sure tonight. You realize
there’s only about seventy hours to go? If I find anything, I
suggest tomorrow we take a small plane and really run a search
over as much of the area as we can. That plane’s a big thing to
hide even under water. You still got your licence?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sure, sure.’ Leiter shrugged his shoulders. ‘I’ll go along
with you. Of course I will. If we find anything, perhaps the
signal I got this evening won’t look so damned silly after all.’</p>

<p class="pindent">So this was what had put Leiter into such a vile temper!
Bond said, ‘What was that?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter took a drink and gazed morosely into his glass. ‘Well,
for my money it’s just so much more attitudinizing by those
power-struck fatcats at the Pentagon. But that sheaf of stuff I
was waving about was a circular to all our men on this job to
say that the Army and the Navy and the Air Force are holding
themselves ready to give full support to <span class="s">CIA</span> if anything turns
up. Think of that, dammit!’ Leiter looked angrily at Bond.
‘Think of the waste of fuel and manpower that must be going
on all over the world keeping all these units at readiness! Just to
show you know what I’ve been allocated as my striking force?’
Leiter gave a harsh, derisive laugh. ‘Half-squadron of Super
Sabre fighter bombers from Pensacola, and—’ Leiter stabbed
Bond’s forearm with a hard finger. ‘And, my friend, the <span class="it">Manta</span>!
The—<span class="it">Manta</span>! Our latest—atomic submarine!’ When Bond
smiled at all this vehemence, Leiter continued more reasonably:
‘Mark you, it’s not quite so idiotic as it sounds. These
Sabres are on anti-submarine sweep duties anyway. Carrying
depth charges. They have to be at readiness. And the <span class="it">Manta</span>
happens to be on some sort of a training cruise in the area,
getting ready to go under the South Pole for a change I suppose,
or some other damned promotion job to help along the Navy
Estimates. But I ask you! Here’s all these million dollars’ worth
of material on instant call from Ensign Leiter, commanding
Room 201 in the Royal Bahamian Hotel! Not Bad!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shrugged his shoulders. ‘Seems to me your President is
taking all this a bit more seriously than his Man in Nassau. I
suppose our Chiefs of Staff have weighed in with our staff on
the other side of the Atlantic. Anyway, no harm in having the
big battalions in the offing just in case Nassau Casino happens
to be Target No 1. By the way, what ideas have your people got
about these targets? What have you got in this part of the world
that fits in with <span class="g">SPECTRE</span>’s letter? We’ve only got the joint
rocket base at a place called North-West Cay at the eastern end
of the Grand Bahamas. That’s about 150 miles north of here.
Apparently the gear and prototypes we and your people have
got there would easily be worth £100,000,000.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The only possible targets I’ve been given are Cape Canaveral,
the naval base at Pensacola, and if the party really is going to
take place in this area, Miami for Target No 2, with Tampa as a
possible runner-up. <span class="g">SPECTRE</span> used the words “a piece of
property belonging to the Western Powers”. That sounds like
some kind of installation to me—something like the uranium
mines in the Congo, for instance. But a rocket base would fit
all right. If we’ve got to take this thing seriously, I’d lay odds
on Canaveral or this place on Grand Bahama. Only thing I
can’t understand, if they’ve got these bombs, how are they
going to transport them to the target and set them off?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A submarine could do it—just lay one of the bombs off-shore
through a torpedo tube. Or a sailing dinghy for the matter of
that. Apparently exploding these things is no problem so long
as they recovered all the parts from the plane. Apparently you’d
just have to insert some kind of fuse thing in the right place between
the <span class="s">TNT</span> and the plutonium, and screw the impact fuse
off the nose and fit a time fuse that would give you time to get a
hundred miles away.’ Bond added casually, ‘Have to have an
expert who knows the drill of course, but the trip would be no
problem for the <span class="it">Disco</span>, for instance. She could lay the bomb off
Grand Bahama at midnight and be back at anchor off Palmyra
by breakfast time.’ He smiled. ‘See what I mean? It all adds
up.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nuts,’ said Leiter succinctly. ‘You’ll have to do better than
that if you want my blood pressure to go up. Anyway, let’s get
the hell out of here and go have ourselves some eggs and bacon
in one of those clip joints on Bay Street. It’ll cost us twenty dollars
plus tax, but the <span class="it">Manta</span> probably burns that every time her
screws turn full circle. Then we’ll go along to the Casino and
see if Mr Fuchs or Signor Pontecorvo is sitting beside Largo
at the black jack table.’</p>
