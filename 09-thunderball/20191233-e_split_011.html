<h3 class="calibre10"><span class="it1">Tea and Animosity</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">I</span>t</span> <span class="lead-in">is just</span> as well that the body retains no memory of pain.
Yes, it hurt, that abscess, that broken bone, but just how it
hurt, and how much, is soon forgotten by the brain and the
nerves. It is not so with pleasant sensations, a scent, a taste, the
particular texture of a kiss. These things can be almost totally
recalled. Bond, gingerly exploring his sensations as life came
flooding back into his body, was astonished that the web of
agony that had held his body so utterly had now completely
dissolved. It was true that his whole spine ached as if it had
been beaten, each vertebra separately, with wooden truncheons,
but this pain was recognizable, something within his knowledge
and therefore capable of control. The searing tornado that had
entered his body and utterly dominated it, replacing his
identity with its own, had gone. How had it been? What had
it been like? Bond couldn’t remember except that it had
reduced him to something lower in the scale of existence than
a handful of grass in the mouth of a tiger.</p>

<p class="pindent">The murmur of voices grew more distinct.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But what told you first that something was wrong, Miss
Fearing?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It was the noise, the noise of the machine. I had just finished
a treatment. A few minutes later I heard it. I’d never heard it so
loud. I thought perhaps the door had been left open. I wasn’t
really worried but I came along to make sure. And there it was.
The indicator up to 200! I tore down the lever and got the
straps off and ran to the surgery and found the coramine and
injected it into the vein—one c.c. The pulse was terribly weak.
Then I telephoned you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You seem to have done everything possible, Miss Fearing.
And I’m sure you bear no responsibility for this terrible thing.’
Mr Wain’s voice was doubtful. ‘It really is most unfortunate. I
suppose the patient must have jerked the lever, somehow. Perhaps
he was experimenting. He might easily have killed himself.
We must tell the company about this and have some safety
arrangement installed.’</p>

<p class="pindent">A hand gingerly clasped Bond’s wrist, feeling for his pulse.
Bond thought it was time to re-enter the world. He must
quickly get himself a doctor, a real one, not one of these grated-carrot
merchants. A sudden wave of anger poured through him.
This was all M’s fault. M was mad. He would have it out with
him when he got back to Headquarters. If necessary he would
go higher—to the Chiefs of Staff, the Cabinet, the Prime
Minister. M was a dangerous lunatic—a danger to the country.
It was up to Bond to save England. The weak, hysterical
thoughts whirled through his brain, mixed themselves up with
the hairy hand of Count Lippe, the mouth of Patricia Fearing,
the taste of hot vegetable soup and, as consciousness slipped
away from him again, the diminishing voice of Mr Wain: ‘No
structural damage. Only considerable surface abrasion of the
nerve ends. And of course shock. You will take personal charge
of the case, Miss Fearing. Rest, warmth, and effleurage. Is
that under. . . ?’</p>

<p class="line10">★</p>

<p class="pindent">Rest, warmth, and effleurage. When Bond came round again,
he was lying face downward on his bed and his whole body was
bathed in exquisite sensation. Beneath him was the soft warmth
of an electric blanket, his back glowed with the heat from two
large sun lamps, and two hands, clad in what felt to be some
particularly velvety fur, were rhythmically passing, one after
the other, up and down the whole length of his body from his
neck to the back of his knees. It was a most gentle and almost
piercingly luxurious experience, and Bond lay and bathed
himself in it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Presently he said sleepily, ‘Is that what they call effleurage?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl’s voice said softly, ‘I thought you’d come round.
The whole tone of your skin suddenly changed. How are you
feeling?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Wonderful. I’d be still better for a double whisky on the
rocks.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl laughed. ‘Mr Wain did say dandelion tea would be
best for you. But I thought a little stimulant might be good, I
mean just this once. So I brought the brandy with me. And
there’s plenty of ice as I’m going to give you an ice-pack
presently. Would you really like some? Wait, I’ll put your
dressing-gown over you and then you can see if you can turn
over. I’ll look the other way.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond heard the lamps being pulled away. Gingerly, he
turned on his side. The dull ache returned, but it was already
wearing off. He cautiously slipped his legs over the side of the
bed and sat up.</p>

<p class="pindent">Patricia Fearing stood in front of him, clean, white, comforting,
desirable. In one hand was a pair of heavy mink gloves, but
with the fur covering the palm instead of the back. In the other
was a glass. She held out the glass. As Bond drank and heard
the reassuring, real-life tinkle of the ice, he thought: this is a
most splendid girl. I will settle down with her. She will give me
effleurage all day long and from time to time a good tough drink
like this. It will be a life of great beauty. He smiled at her and
held out the empty glass and said, ‘More.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She laughed, mostly with relief that he was completely alive
again. She took the glass and said, ‘Well, just one more then.
But don’t forget it’s on an empty stomach. It may make you
dreadfully tight.’ She paused with the brandy bottle in her
hand. Suddenly her gaze was cool, clinical. ‘And now you must
try and tell me what happened. Did you accidentally touch the
lever or something? You gave us all a dreadful fright. Nothing
like that has ever happened before. The Traction table’s really
perfectly safe, you know.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked candidly into her eyes. He said reassuringly,
‘Of course. I was just trying to get more comfortable. I heaved
about and I do remember that my hand hit something rather
hard. I suppose it must have been the lever. Then I don’t
remember any more. I must have been awfully lucky you came
along so quickly.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She handed him the fresh drink. ‘Well, it’s all over now. And
thank heavens nothing’s badly strained. Another two days of
treatment and you’ll be right as rain.’ She paused. She looked
rather embarrassed. ‘Oh, and Mr Wain asks if you could
possibly keep all this, all this trouble, to yourself. He doesn’t
want the other patients to get worried.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I should think not, thought Bond. He could see the headlines.
‘<span class="s">PATIENT TORN NEARLY LIMB FROM LIMB
AT NATURE CLINIC. RACK MACHINE GOES
BERSERK. MINISTRY OF HEALTH STEPS IN.</span>’
He said, ‘Of course I won’t say anything. It was my fault
anyway.’ He finished his drink, handed back the glass, and
cautiously lay back on the bed. He said, ‘That was marvellous.
Now how about some more of the mink treatment. And by
the way. Will you marry me? You’re the only girl I’ve ever
met who knows how to treat a man properly.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She laughed. ‘Don’t be silly. And turn over on your face. It’s
your back that needs treatment.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How do you know?’</p>

<p class="line10">★</p>

<p class="pindent">Two days later, Bond was once more back in the half-world
of the nature cure. The routine of the early morning glass of hot
water, the orange, carefully sliced into symmetrical pigs by
some ingenious machine wielded, no doubt, by the wardress in
charge of diets, then the treatments, the hot soup, the siesta,
and the blank, aimless walk or bus ride to the nearest tea-shop
for the priceless strength-giving cups of tea laced with brown
sugar. Bond loathed and despised tea, that flat, soft, time-wasting
opium of the masses, but on his empty stomach, and
in his febrile state, the sugary brew acted almost as an intoxicant.
Three cups he reckoned had the effect, not of hard liquor,
but of just about half a bottle of champagne in the outside
world, in real life. He got to know them all, these dainty opium
dens—Rose Cottage, which he avoided after the woman
charged him extra for emptying the sugar bowl; The Thatched
Barn, which amused him because it was a real den of iniquity—large
plates of sugar cakes put on one’s table, the piercing
temptation of the smell of hot scones—the Transport Café,
where the Indian tea was black and strong and the lorry drivers
brought in a smell of sweat and petrol and the great world
(Bond found that all his senses, particularly his palate and
nose, had miraculously become sharpened), and a dozen other
cottagey, raftery nooks where elderly couples with Ford
Populars and Morris Minors talked in muted tones about
children called Len and Ron and Pearl and Ethel, and ate in
small mouthfuls with the points of their teeth and made not a
sound with the tea things. It was all a world whose ghastly
daintiness and propriety would normally have sickened him.
Now, empty, weak, drained of all the things that belonged to
his tough, fast, basically dirty life, through banting, he had
somehow regained some of the innocence and purity of childhood.
In this frame of mind, the naivety and total lack of
savour, surprise, excitement, of the dimity world of the Nice-Cup-of-Tea,
of the Home-made Cakes, and the One-Lump-or-Two,
were perfectly acceptable.</p>

<p class="pindent">And the extraordinary thing was that he could not remember
when he had felt so well—not strong, but without any aches and
pains, clear of eye and skin, sleeping ten hours a day and, above
all, without that nagging sense of morning guilt that one is
slowly wrecking one’s body. It was really quite disturbing. Was
his personality changing? Was he losing his edge, his point, his
identity? Was he losing the vices that were so much part of his
ruthless, cruel, fundamentally tough character? Who was he
in process of becoming? A soft, dreaming, kindly idealist who
would naturally leave the Service and become instead a prison
visitor, interest himself in youth clubs, march with the H-bomb
marchers, eat nut cutlets, try and change the world for the
better?</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond would have been more worried, as day by day
the H-cure drew his teeth, if it had not been for three obsessions
which belonged to his former life and which would not
leave him—a passionate longing for a large dish of Spaghetti
Bolognese containing plenty of chopped garlic and accompanied
by a whole bottle of the cheapest, rawest Chianti (bulk for his
empty stomach and sharp tastes for his starved palate), an
overwhelming desire for the strong, smooth body of Patricia
Fearing, and a deadly concentration on ways and means to
wring the guts out of Count Lippe.</p>

<p class="pindent">The first two would have to wait, though tantalizing schemes
for consuming both dishes on the day of his release from Shrublands
occupied much of his mind. So far as Count Lippe was
concerned, work had started on the project from the moment
Bond took up again the routine of the cure.</p>

<p class="pindent">With the cold intensity he would have employed against an
enemy agent, say in a hotel in Stockholm or Lisbon during the
war, James Bond set about spying on the other man. He became
garrulous and inquisitive, chatting with Patricia Fearing
about the various routines at Shrublands. ‘But when do the
staff find time to have lunch?’ ‘That man Lippe looks very fit.
Oh, he’s worried about his waist-line! Aren’t the electric
blanket-baths good for that? No, I haven’t seen the Turkish
Bath Cabinet. Must have a look at it some time.’ And to his
masseur: ‘Haven’t seen that big chap about lately, Count
something—Ripper? Hipper? Oh yes, Lippe. Oh, noon every
day? I think I must try and get that time as well. Nice being
clear for the rest of the day. And I’d like to have a spell in the
Turkish Bath thing when you’ve finished the massage. Need a
good sweat.’ Innocently, fragment by fragment, James Bond
built up a plan of operations—a plan that would leave him and
Lippe alone among the machinery of the sound-proof
treatment rooms.</p>

<p class="pindent">For there would be no other opportunity. Count Lippe kept
to his room in the main building until his treatment time at
noon. In the afternoons he swished away in the violet Bentley—to
Bournemouth it seemed, where he had ‘business’. The night
porter let him in around eleven each night. One afternoon—in
the siesta hour—Bond slipped the Yale lock on Count Lippe’s
room with a straight piece of plastic cut off a child’s aeroplane
he had bought for the purpose in Washington. He went over
the room meticulously and drew a blank. All he learned—from
the clothes—was that the Count was a much travelled man—shirts
from Charvet, ties from Tripler, Dior, and Hardy Amies,
shoes from Peel, and raw silk pyjamas from Hong Kong. The
dark red morocco suitcase from Mark Cross might have contained
secrets, and Bond eyed the silk linings and toyed with
the Count’s Wilkinson razor. But no! Better that revenge, if it
could be contrived, should come out of a clear sky.</p>

<p class="pindent">That same afternoon, drinking his treacly tea, Bond scraped
together the meagre scraps of his knowledge of Count Lippe.
He was about thirty, attractive to women, and physically, to
judge from the naked body Bond had seen, very strong. His
blood would be Portuguese with a dash of Chinaman and he
gave the appearance of wealth. What did he do? What was his
profession? At first glance Bond would have put him down as a
tough <span class="it">maquereau</span> from the Ritz bar in Paris, the Palace at St
Moritz, the Carlton at Cannes—good at backgammon, polo,
water-skiing, but with the yellow streak of the man who lives
on women. But Lippe had heard Bond making inquiries about
him and that had been enough for an act of violence—an
inspired act that he had carried out swiftly and coolly when he
finished his treatment with the Fearing girl and knew, from her
remark, that Bond would be alone on the traction table. The
act of violence might only have been designed to warn, but
equally, since Lippe could only guess at the effect of a 200-lb
pull on the spine, it might have been designed to kill. Why?
Who was this man who had so much to hide? And what were
his secrets? Bond poured the last of his tea on to a mound of
brown sugar. One thing was certain—the secrets were big ones.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond never seriously considered telling Headquarters about
Lippe and what he had done to Bond. The whole thing, against
the background of Shrublands, was so unlikely and so utterly
ridiculous. And somehow Bond, the man of action and resource,
came out of it all as something of a ninny. Weakened by a diet of
hot water and vegetable soup, the ace of the Secret Service had
been tied to some kind of a rack and then a man had come along
and just pulled a lever up a few notches and reduced the hero of
a hundred combats to a quivering jelly! No! There was only
one solution—a private solution, man to man. Later perhaps, to
satisfy his curiosity, it might be amusing to put through a good
Trace on Count Lippe—with <span class="s">SIS</span> Records, with the <span class="s">CID</span>,
with the Hong Kong Station. But for the time being Bond
would stay quiet, keep out of Count Lippe’s way, and plan
meticulously for just the right kind of pay-off.</p>

<p class="pindent">By the time the fourteenth day, the last day, came, Bond had
it all fixed—the time, the place, and the method.</p>

<p class="pindent">At ten o’clock, Mr Joshua Wain received Bond for his final
check-up. When Bond came into the consulting-room, Mr Wain
was standing by the open window doing deep-breathing exercises.
With a final thorough exhalation through the nostrils he
turned to greet Bond with an Ah! Bisto! expression on his
healthily flushed face. His smile was elastic with good-fellowship.
‘And how’s the world treating you, Mr Bond? No ill
effects from that unhappy little accident? No. Quite so. The
body is a most remarkable piece of mechanism. Extraordinary
powers of recovery. Now then, shirt off, please, and we’ll see
what Shrublands has managed to do for you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Ten minutes later, Bond, blood pressure down to 132/84,
weight reduced by ten pounds, osteopathic lesions gone, clear
of eye and tongue, was on his way down to the basement rooms
for his final treatment.</p>

<p class="pindent">As usual, it was clammily quiet and neutral-smelling in the
white rooms and corridors. From the separate cubicles there
came an occasional soft exchange between patient and staff,
and, in the background, intermittent plumbing noises. The
steady whir of the ventilation system created the impression of
the deep innards of a liner in a dead calm. It was nearly twelve
thirty. Bond lay face down on the massage table and listened
for the authoritative voice and the quick slap of the naked feet
of his prey. The door at the end of the corridor sighed open
and sighed shut again. ‘Morning, Beresford. All ready for me?
Make it good and hot today. Last treatment. Three more
ounces to lose. Right?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Very good, sir.’ The gym shoes of the chief attendant, followed
by the slapping feet, came down the corridor outside the
plastic curtain of the massage room and on to the end room of
all, the electric Turkish bath. The door sighed shut and a few
minutes later sighed again as the attendant, having installed
Count Lippe, came back down the corridor. Twenty minutes
went by. Twenty-five. Bond rolled off the table. ‘Well, thanks,
Sam. You’ve done me a power of good. I’ll be back to see you
again one of these days I expect. I’ll just go along and have a
final salt rub and a Sitz bath. You cut along to your carrot
cutlets. Don’t worry about me. I’ll let myself out when I’ve
finished.’ Bond wrapped a towel round his waist and moved
off down the corridor. There was a flurry of movement and
voices as the attendants got rid of their patients and made their
way through the staff door for the luncheon break. The last
patient, a reformed drunk, called back from the entrance, ‘See
you later, Irrigator!’ Somebody laughed. Now the petty-officer
voice of Beresford sounded down the corridor, making
certain that everything was shipshape: ‘Windows, Bill? Okay.
Your next is Mr Dunbar at two sharp. Len, tell the laundry
we shall need more towels after lunch. Ted . . . Ted. You
there, Ted? Well, then, Sam, look after Count Lippe, would
you, Turkish bath.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had listened to this routine for a whole week, noting
the men that cut minutes off their duty and got off early to
lunch, noting the ones that stayed to do their full share of the
last chores. Now, from the open door of the empty shower
room, he called back, in Sam’s deep voice, ‘Okay, Mr Beresford,’
and waited for the crisp squeak of the gym shoes on the
linoleum. There it was! The brief pause half-way down the
corridor and then the double sigh as the staff door opened and
shut. Now there was dead silence save for the hum of the fans.
The treatment rooms were empty. Now there was only James
Bond and Count Lippe.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond waited a moment and then came out of the shower
room and softly opened the door to the Turkish bath. He had
had one session in the place, just to get the geography clear in
his mind, and the scene was exactly as he remembered.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a white cubicle treatment-room like all the others, but
in this one the only object was a big cream metal and plastic box
about five feet tall by four feet square. It was closed on all sides
but the top. The front of the big cabinet was hinged to allow a
patient to climb in and sit inside and there was a hole in the top
with a foam rubber support for the nape of the neck and the
chin, through which the patient’s head emerged. The rest of
his body was exposed to the heat from many rows of naked
electric bulbs inside the cabinet and the degree of heat was
thermostatically controlled by a dial at the back of the cabinet.
It was a simple sweat-box, designed, as Bond had noticed on
his previous visit to the room, by the Medikalischer Maschinenbau
G.m.b.H., 44 Franziskanerstrasse, Ulm, Bavaria.</p>

<p class="pindent">The cabinet faced away from the door. At the hiss of the
hydraulic fastener, Count Lippe said angrily, ‘Goddammit,
Beresford. Let me out of this thing. I’m sweating like a pig.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You said you wanted it hot, sir.’ Bond’s amiable voice was a
good approximation to the chief attendant’s.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t argue, goddammit. Let me out of here.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I don’t think you quite realize the value of heat in the H-Cure,
sir. Heat resolves many of the toxins in the blood-stream
and for the matter of that in the muscle tissue also. A patient
suffering from your condition of pronounced toxaemia will
find much benefit from the heat treatment.’ Bond found the
H-lingo rattling quite easily off the tongue. He was not worried
about the consequences to Beresford. He would have the solid
alibi of luncheon in the staff canteen.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t give me that crap. I tell you, let me out of here.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond examined the dial on the back of the machine. The
needle stood at 120. What should he give the man? The dial
ran up to 200 degrees. That much might roast him alive. This
was only to be a punishment, not a murder. Perhaps 180 would
be a just retribution. Bond clicked the knob up to 180. He said:
‘I think just half an hour of real heat will do you the world of
good, sir.’ Bond dropped the sham voice. He added sharply,
‘And if you catch fire you can sue.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The dripping head tried to turn, failed. Bond moved towards
the door. Count Lippe now had a new voice, controlled but desperate.
He said woodenly, concealing the knowledge and the
hate, ‘Give you a thousand pounds and we’re quits.’ He heard
the hiss of the opening door. ‘Ten thousand. All right then,
fifty.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond closed the door firmly behind him and walked quickly
down the corridor to put on his clothes and get out. Behind
him, deeply muffled, came the first shout for help. Bond closed
his ears. There was nothing that a painful week in hospital and
plenty of Gentian Violet or Tannic Acid jelly wouldn’t cure.
But it did cross his mind that a man who could offer a bribe of
fifty thousand pounds must be either very rich or have some
very urgent reason for needing freedom of movement. It was
surely too much to pay just for avoidance of pain.</p>

<p class="line10">★</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond was right. The outcome of this rather childish
trial of strength between two extremely tough and ruthless men,
in the bizarre surroundings of a nature clinic in Sussex, was to
upset, if only in a minute fashion, the exactly-timed machinery
of a plot that was about to shake the governments of the
Western world.</p>
