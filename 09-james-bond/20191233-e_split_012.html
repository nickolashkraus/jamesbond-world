<h3 class="calibre10"><span class="it1">SPECTRE</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he Boulevard Haussmann,</span> in the VIIIth and IXth
Arrondissements, stretches from the Rue du Faubourg St
Honoré to the Opera. It is very long and very dull, but it is perhaps
the solidest street in the whole of Paris. Not the richest—the
Avenue d’Iéna has that distinction—but rich people are
not necessarily solid people and too many of the landlords and
tenants in the Avenue d’Iéna have names ending in ‘escu’,
‘ovitch’, ‘ski’, and ‘stein’, and these are sometimes not the
endings of respectable names. Moreover, the Avenue d’Iéna is
almost entirely residential. The occasional discreet brass
plate giving the name of a holding company in Liechtenstein
or in the Bahamas or the Canton de Vaud in Switzerland are
there for tax purposes only—the cover names for private
family fortunes seeking alleviation from the punitive burden
of the Revenue, or, more briefly, tax-dodging. The Boulevard
Haussmann is not like that. The massive, turn-of-the-century,
bastard Second Empire buildings in heavily ornamented brick
and stucco are the ‘sièges’, the seats, of important businesses.
Here are the head offices of the <span class="it">gros industriels</span> from Lille,
Lyons, Bordeaux, Clermont Ferrand, the ‘locaux’ of the <span class="it">grosses
légumes</span>, the ‘big vegetables’ in cotton, artificial silk, coal, wine,
steel, and shipping. If, among them, there are some fly-by-nights
concealing a lack of serious capital—<span class="it">des fonds sérieux</span>—behind
a good address, it would only be fair to admit that such
men of paper exist also behind the even solider frontages of
Lombard and Wall Streets.</p>

<p class="pindent">It is appropriate that among this extremely respectable company
of tenants, suitably diversified by a couple of churches, a
small museum and the French Shakespeare Society, you should
also find the headquarters of charitable organizations. At No.
136 <span class="it">bis</span>, for instance, a discreetly glittering brass plate says
‘<span class="it"><span class="s">FIRCO</span></span>’ and, underneath, ‘<span class="it">Fraternité Internationale de la
Résistance Contre l’Oppression</span>’. If you were interested in this
organization, either as an idealist or because you were a sales
man of, say, office furniture, and you pressed the very clean
porcelain bell button, the door would in due course be opened
by an entirely typical French concierge. If your business was
serious or obviously well-meaning, the concierge would show
you across a rather dusty hall to tall, bogus Directoire double
doors adjoining the over-ornamented cage of a shaky-looking
lift. Inside the doors you would be greeted by exactly what
you had expected to see—a large dingy room needing a fresh
coat of its café-au-lait paint, in which half a dozen men sat at
cheap desks and typed or wrote amidst the usual accoutrements
of a busy organization—In and Out baskets, telephones,
in this case the old-fashioned standard ones that are typical of
such an office in this part of Paris, and dark green metal filing
cabinets in which drawers stand open. If you were observant
of small details, you might register that all the men were of
approximately the same age-group, between thirty and forty,
and that in an office where you would have expected to find
women doing the secretarial work, there were none.</p>

<p class="pindent">Inside the tall door you would receive the slightly defensive
welcome appropriate to a busy organization accustomed to the
usual proportion of cranks and time-wasters but, in response to
your serious inquiry, the face of the man at the desk near the
door would clear and become cautiously helpful. The aims of
the Fraternity? We exist, monsieur, to keep alive the ideals that
flourished during the last war among members of all Resistance
groups. No, monsieur, we are entirely unpolitical. Our funds?
They come from modest subscriptions from our members and
from certain private persons who share our aims. You have perhaps
a relative, a member of a Resistance group, whose whereabouts
you seek? Certainly, monsieur. The name? Gregor
Karlski, last heard of with Mihailovitch in the summer of 1943.
Jules! (He might turn to a particular man and call out.) Karlski,
Gregor. Mihailovitch, 1943. Jules would go to a cabinet and
there would be a brief pause. Then the reply might come back,
Dead. Killed in the bombing of the General’s headquarters,
October 21 1943. I regret, monsieur. Is there anything further
we can do for you? Then perhaps you would care to have some
of our literature. Forgive me for not having time to spare to
give you more details of <span class="g">FIRCO</span> myself. But you will find everything
there. This happens to be a particularly busy day. This is
the International Refugee Year and we have many inquiries
such as yours from all over the world. Good afternoon,
monsieur. <span class="it">Pas de quoi.</span></p>

<p class="pindent">So, or more or less so, it would be and you would go out on to
the Boulevard satisfied and even impressed with an organization
that was doing its excellent if rather vague work with so
much dedication and efficiency.</p>

<p class="pindent">On the day after James Bond had completed his nature cure
and had left for London after, the night before, scoring a most
satisfactory left and right of Spaghetti Bolognese and Chianti at
Lucien’s in Brighton and of Miss Patricia Fearing on the squab
seats from her bubble car high up on the Downs, an emergency
meeting of the Trustees of <span class="g">FIRCO</span> was called for seven o’clock in
the evening. The men, for they were all men, came from all
over Europe, by train or car or aeroplane, and they entered
No 136 <span class="it">bis</span> singly or in pairs, some by the front door and some
by the back, at intervals during the late afternoon and evening.
Each man had his allotted time for arriving at these meetings—so
many minutes, up to two hours, before zero hour—and
each man alternated between the back and the front door from
meeting to meeting. Now there were two ‘concierges’ for each
door and other less obvious security measures—warning
systems, closed-circuit television scanning of the two entrances,
and complete sets of dummy <span class="g">FIRCO</span> minutes, backed up one
hundred per cent by the current business of the <span class="g">FIRCO</span>
organization on the ground floor. Thus, if necessary, the
deliberations of the ‘Trustees’ could, in a matter only of
seconds, be switched from clandestine to overt—as solidly
overt as any meeting of principals in the Boulevard Haussmann
could possibly be.</p>

<p class="pindent">At seven o’clock precisely the twenty men who made up this
organization strode, lounged or sidled, each according to his
character, into the workmanlike boardroom on the third floor.
Their chairman was already in his seat. No greetings were exchanged.
They were ruled by the chairman to be a waste of
breath and, in an organization of this nature, hypocritical. The
men filed round the table and took their places at their numbers,
the numbers from one to twenty-one that were their only
names and that, as a small security precaution, advanced round
the rota by two digits at midnight on the first of every month.
Nobody smoked—drinking was taboo and smoking frowned
upon—and nobody bothered to glance down at the bogus
<span class="g">FIRCO</span> agenda on the table in front of him. They sat very still
and looked up the table at the chairman with expressions of the
sharpest interest and what, in lesser men, would have been
obsequious respect.</p>

<p class="pindent">Any man seeing No 2, for that was the chairman’s number of
the month, even for the first time would have looked at him
with some degree of the same feelings, for he was one of those
men—one meets perhaps only two or three in a lifetime—who
seem almost to suck the eyes out of your head. These rare
men are apt to possess three basic attributes—their physical appearance
is extraordinary, they have a quality of relaxation, of
inner certainty, and they exude a powerful animal magnetism.
The herd has always recognized the other-worldliness of these
phenomena and in primitive tribes you will find that any man
singled out by nature in this fashion will also have been chosen
by the tribe to be their chief. Certain great men of history, perhaps
Genghis Khan, Alexander the Great, Napoleon, among
the politicians, have had these qualities. Perhaps they even
explain the hypnotic sway of an altogether more meagre
individual, the otherwise inexplicable Adolf Hitler, over eighty
million of the most gifted nation in Europe. Certainly No 2 had
these qualities and any man in the street would have recognized
them—let alone these twenty chosen men. For them, despite
the deep cynicism ingrained in their respective callings, despite
their basic insensitivity towards the human race, he was, however
reluctantly, their Supreme Commander—almost their god.</p>

<p class="pindent">This man’s name was Ernst Stavro Blofeld and he was born
in Gdynia of a Polish father and a Greek mother on 28 May,
1908. After matriculating in economics and political history at
the University of Warsaw he studied engineering and radionics
at the Warsaw Technical Institute and, at the age of twenty-five,
obtained a modest post in the central administration of the
Ministry of Posts and Telegraphs. This would seem a curious
choice for such a highly gifted youth, but Blofeld had come to
an interesting conclusion about the future of the world. He had
decided that fast and accurate communication lay, in a contracting
world, at the very heart of power. Knowledge of the
truth before the next man, in peace or war, lay, he thought,
behind every correct decision in history and was the source of
all great reputations. He was doing very well on this theory,
watching the cables and radiograms that passed through his
hands at the Central Post Office and buying or selling on
margin on the Warsaw Bourse—only occasionally, when he was
absolutely certain, but then very big—when the basic nature
of the postal traffic changed. Now Poland was mobilizing for
war and a spate of munition orders and diplomatic cables
poured through his department. Blofeld changed his tactics.
This was valuable stuff, worth nothing to him, but priceless to
the enemy. Clumsily at first, and then more expertly, he contrived
to take copies of cables, choosing, for the ciphers hid
their contents from him, only those prefixed ‘<span class="g">MOST IMMEDIATE</span>’
or ‘<span class="g">MOST SECRET</span>’. Then, working carefully, he built
up in his head a network of fictitious agents. These were real
but small people in the various embassies and armament firms
to whom most of the traffic was addressed—a junior cipher
clerk in the British Embassy, a translator working for the
French, private secretaries—real ones—in the big firms. These
names were easily obtained from the diplomatic lists, by ringing
up a firm and asking Enquiries for the name of the chairman’s
private secretary. He was speaking for the Red Cross. They
wished to discuss the possibility of a donation from the chairman.
And so on. When Blofeld had all his names right, he
christened his network <span class="g">TARTAR</span> and made a discreet approach
to the German Military Attaché with one or two specimens of
its work. He was rapidly passed on to the representative of
<span class="s">AMT</span> IV of the Abwehr, and from then on things were easy.
When this pot was bubbling merrily, and the money (he refused
to accept payment except in American dollars) coming in (it
came in fast; he explained that he had so many agents to pay
off), he proceeded to widen his market. He considered the
Russians but dismissed them, and the Czechs, as probable
non-, or at any rate slow, payers. Instead he chose the Americans
and the Swedes, and money positively showered in on
him. He soon realized, for he was a man of almost mimosaic
sensibility in matters of security, that the pace could not
possibly last. There would be a leak: perhaps between the
Swedish and German secret services, who he knew (for
through his contacts with their spies he was picking up the
gossip of his new trade) were working closely together in some
territories; or through Allied counter-espionage or their cryptographic
services; or else one of his national agents would die or
be transferred without his knowledge while he continued to use
the name as a source. Anyway, by now he had two hundred
thousand dollars and there was the added spur that the war was
getting too close for comfort. It was time for him to be off into
the wide world—into one of the safe bits of it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Blofeld carried out his withdrawal expertly. First he slowly
petered off the service. Security, he explained, was being tightened
up by the English and the French. Perhaps there had been
a leak—he looked with mild reproof into the eyes of his contact—this
secretary had had a change of heart, that one was asking
too much money. Then he went to his friend on the Bourse and,
after sealing his lips with a thousand dollars, had all his funds
invested in Shell Bearer Bonds in Amsterdam and thence transferred
to a Numbered Safe Deposit box with the Diskonto
Bank in Zurich. Before the final step of telling his contacts that
he was brulé and that the Polish Deuxième Bureau was sniffing
at his heels, he paid a visit to Gdynia, called on the Registrar
and on the Church where he had been baptized and, on the
pretext of looking up details of an invented friend, neatly cut
out the page recording his own name and birth. It remained
only to locate the passport factory that operates in every big
seaport and purchase a Canadian seaman’s passport for 2,000
dollars. Then he was off to Sweden by the next boat. After a
pause in Stockholm for a careful look round the world and
some cool thinking about the probable course of the war, he
flew to Turkey on his original Polish passport, transferred his
money from Switzerland to the Ottoman Bank in Istanbul,
and waited for Poland to fall. When, in due course, this happened,
he claimed refuge in Turkey and spent a little money
amongst the right officials in order to get his claim established.
Then he settled down. Ankara Radio was glad to have his
expert services and he set up <span class="g">RAHIR</span>, another espionage service
built on the lines of <span class="g">TARTAR</span>, but rather more solidly. Blofeld
wisely waited to ascertain the victor before selling his wares,
and it was only when Rommel had been kicked out of Africa
that he plumped for the Allies. He finished the war in a blaze
of glory and prosperity and with decorations or citations from
the British, Americans, and French. Then, with half a million
dollars in Swiss banks and a Swedish passport in the name of
Serge Angstrom, he slipped off to South America for a rest,
some good food, and a fresh think.</p>

<p class="pindent">And now Ernst Blofeld, the name to which he had decided it
was perfectly safe to return, sat in the quiet room in the Boulevard
Haussmann, gazed slowly round the faces of his twenty
men, and looked for eyes that didn’t squarely meet his. Blofeld’s
own eyes were deep black pools surrounded—totally
surrounded, as Mussolini’s were—by very clear whites. The
doll-like effect of this unusual symmetry was enhanced by long
silken black eyelashes that should have belonged to a woman.
The gaze of these soft doll’s eyes was totally relaxed and rarely
held any expression stronger than a mild curiosity in the object
of their focus. They conveyed a restful certitude in their
owner and in their analysis of what they observed. To the
innocent, they exuded confidence, a wonderful cocoon of
confidence in which the observed one could rest and relax
knowing that he was in comfortable, reliable hands. But they
stripped the guilty or the false and made him feel transparent—as
transparent as a fishbowl through whose sides Blofeld
examined, with only the most casual curiosity, the few solid
fish, the grains of truth, suspended in the void of deceit or attempted
obscurity. Blofeld’s gaze was a microscope, the window
on the world of a superbly clear brain, with a focus that had
been sharpened by thirty years of danger and of keeping just
one step ahead of it, and of an inner self-assurance built up
on a lifetime of success in whatever he had attempted.</p>

<p class="pindent">The skin beneath the eyes that now slowly, mildly, surveyed
his colleagues was unpouched. There was no sign of debauchery,
illness, or old age on the large, white, bland face under
the square, wiry black crew-cut. The jawline, going to the
appropriate middle-aged fat of authority, showed decision and
independence. Only the mouth, under a heavy, squat nose,
marred what might have been the face of a philosopher or a
scientist. Proud and thin, like a badly healed wound, the compressed,
dark lips, capable only of false, ugly smiles, suggested
contempt, tyranny, and cruelty. But to an almost
Shakespearian degree, nothing about Blofeld was small.</p>

<p class="pindent">Blofeld’s body weighed about twenty stone. It had once been
all muscle—he had been an amateur weightlifter in his youth—but
in the past ten years it had softened and he had a vast belly
that he concealed behind roomy trousers and well-cut double-breasted
suits, tailored, that evening, out of beige doeskin.
Blofeld’s hands and feet were long and pointed. They were
quick-moving when they wanted to be, but normally, as now,
they were still and reposed. For the rest, he didn’t smoke or
drink and he had never been known to sleep with a member of
either sex. He didn’t even eat very much. So far as vices or
physical weaknesses were concerned, Blofeld had always been
an enigma to everyone who had known him.</p>

<p class="pindent">The twenty men who looked up the long table at this man
and waited patiently for him to speak were a curious mixture of
national types. But they had certain characteristics in common.
They were all in the thirty-to-forty age-group, they all looked
extremely fit, and nearly all of them—there were two who were
different—had quick, hard, predatory eyes, the eyes of the
wolves and the hawks that prey upon the herd. The two who
were different were both scientists with scientists’ other-worldly
eyes—Kotze, the East German physicist who had come
over to the West five years before and had exchanged his secrets
for a modest pension and retirement in Switzerland, and
Maslov, formerly Kandinsky, the Polish electronics expert
who, in 1956, had resigned as head of the radio research
department of Philips <span class="s">AG</span> of Eindhoven and had then disappeared
into obscurity. The other eighteen men consisted of
cells of three (Blofeld accepted the Communist triangle
system for security reasons) from six national groups and,
within these groups, from six of the world’s great criminal
and subversive organizations. There were three Sicilians from
the top echelon of the Unione Siciliano, the Mafia; three
Corsican Frenchmen from the Union Corse, the secret society,
contemporary with and similar to the Mafia, that runs nearly
all organized crime in France; three former members of
<span class="g">SMERSH</span>, the Soviet organization for the execution of traitors
and enemies of the State that had been disbanded on the orders
of Khruschev in 1958, and replaced by the Special Executive
Department of the <span class="s">MWD</span>; three of the top surviving members
of the former Sonderdienst of the Gestapo; three tough Yugoslav
operatives who had resigned from Marshal Tito’s Secret
Police; and three highland Turks (the Turks of the plains are
no good), former members of Blofeld’s <span class="g">RAHIR</span> and subsequently
responsible for <span class="g">KRYSTAL</span>, the important Middle
East heroin pipeline whose outlet is Beirut. These eighteen
men, all experts in conspiracy, in the highest ranges of secret
communication and action and, above all, of silence, also
shared one supreme virtue—every man had a solid cover.
Every man possessed a valid passport with up-to-date visas
for the principal countries in the world, and an entirely clean
sheet with Interpol, and with their respective national police
forces. That factor alone, the factor of each man’s cleanness
after a lifetime in big crime, was his highest qualification for
membership of <span class="s">SPECTRE</span>—The Special Executive for
Counterintelligence, Terrorism, Revenge, and Extortion.</p>

<p class="pindent">The founder and chairman of this private enterprise for
private profit was Ernst Stavro Blofeld.</p>
