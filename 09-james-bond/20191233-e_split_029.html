<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n</span> <span class="lead-in">the attack</span> centre of the <span class="it">Manta</span> it was very quiet. Commander
Pedersen, standing behind the man at the echo-sounder,
occasionally made a comment over his shoulder to
Bond and Leiter, who had been given canvas-backed chairs
well away from the depth- and speed-gauges, which had been
hooded so that they could only be read by the navigating team.
These three men sat side by side on red leather, foam cushioned,
aluminium seats, handling the rudder and the forward
and aft diving planes as if they were pilots in an airliner. Now
the captain left the echo-sounder and came over to Bond and
Leiter. He smiled cheerfully. ‘Thirty fathoms and the nearest
cay is a mile to westwards. Now we’ve got a clear course all
the way to Grand Bahama. And we’re making good speed.
If we keep it up, we’ve got about four hours’ sailing. Be off
Grand Bahama about an hour before first light. How about
some food and a bit of sleep? There won’t be anything on the
radar for an hour—these Berry Islands’ll fill the screen until
we’re clear of them. Then’ll come the big question. When
we clear them, shall we see that one of the smallest of the cays
has broken loose and is sailing fast northwards on a parallel
course to ours? If we see that on the screen, it’ll be the <span class="it">Disco</span>.
If she’s there, we’ll submerge. You’ll hear the alarm bells. But
you can just roll over and have a bit more sleep. Nothing can
happen until it’s certain that she’s in the target area. Then
we’ll have to think again.’ The captain made for the stairway.
‘Mind if I lead the way? Watch your head on the pipes.
This is the one part of the ship where there isn’t much
clearance.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They followed him down and along a passage to the mess
hall, a well-lighted dining-room finished in cream with pastel
pink and green panels. They took their places at the head of
one of the Formica-top tables away from the other officers and
men, who looked curiously at the two civilians. The captain
waved a hand at the walls of the room. ‘Bit of a change from
the old battleship grey. You’d be surprised how many eggheads
are involved in the design of these ships. Have to be, if you
want to keep your crew happy when the ship’s submerged
for a month or more at a time. The trick-cyclists said we
couldn’t have just one colour, must have contrast everywhere
or the men’s eyes get sort of depressed. This hall’s used for
movies, closed-circuit television, cribbage tournaments, bingo,
God knows what—anything to keep the men off duty from
getting bored. And you notice there’s no smell of cooking
or engine smells. Electrostatic precipitators all over the ship
that filter them off.’ A steward came with menus. ‘Now then,
let’s get down to it. I’m having the baked Virginia ham with
red-eye gravy, apple-pie with ice cream, and iced coffee.
And steward, don’t go too easy on that red-eye.’ He turned
to Bond. ‘Getting out of harbour always gives me an
appetite. You know, it isn’t the sea the captain hates, it’s the
land.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond ordered poached eggs with rye toast and coffee. He was
grateful for the captain’s cheerful talk, but he himself had no
appetite. There was a gnawing tension inside him which would
only be released when the <span class="it">Disco</span> was picked up on the radar and
there would be a prospect of action. And lurking behind his
concern about the whole operation was worry about the girl.
Had he been right to trust her with so much of the truth?
Had she betrayed him? Had she been caught? Was she alive?
He drank down a glass of iced water, and listened to the captain
explaining how the ice cubes and the water were distilled
from the sea.</p>

<p class="pindent">Finally Bond became impatient with the cheerful, even tone
of the conversation. He said, ‘Forgive me, Captain, but could I
interrupt for a moment and clear my mind about what we’re
going to do if we’re right about the <span class="it">Disco</span> and if we come up
with her off the Grand Bahama? I can’t quite figure what the
next step ought to be. I’ve got my own ideas, but were you
thinking we’d try and go alongside and board her, or just blow
her out of the water?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The captain’s grey eyes were quizzical. He said, ‘I was kind
of leaving all that to you fellers. The Navy Department says
that I’m under your orders. I’m just the chauffeur. Supposing
you tell me what you have in mind and I’ll be glad to go along
with anything you suggest so long as it doesn’t endanger my
ship—’ he smiled—‘too much, that is. In the last resort, if the
Navy Department means what it says, and from your account
of this operation it does, the safety of the ship will also have to
go by the board. As I told you aloft in the attack centre, I got
acknowledgement of our signal and full approval for our proposed
course of action. That’s all the clearance I need. Now
then, you tell me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The food came. Bond pecked at his eggs and pushed them
away. He lit a cigarette. He said, looking at Felix Leiter,
‘Well, I don’t know what you’ve worked out, Felix, but this is
how I see the picture we may find around four o’clock in the
morning, on the assumption, that is, that the <span class="it">Disco</span> has been
sailing north in shoal water under cover of the Berry Islands
and that she’ll then make for the Grand Bahama shore somewhere
off the site of the missile station. Well now, on that
assumption, I’ve had a good look at the charts and it seems to
me that, if she’s going to lay that bomb as close to the target as
she can, she’ll heave to and anchor about a mile off-shore in
about ten fathoms and get the bomb another half-mile or so
closer to the target, lay it in twelve feet of water or so, switch
on the time mechanism and get the hell away. That’s how I’d
go about it. She’d be away by first light and there’s plenty
of yacht traffic around West End from what I can gather from
the pilot. She’d show up on the station radar of course, but
she’d be just another yacht. Assuming the bomb’s set for the
twelve hours Largo’s got before the time limit expires, he could
be back in Nassau or twice as far away if he wanted in the time
he’s got. For my money, he’ll go back to Nassau with his
treasure-hunting story and wait for the next lot of orders from
<span class="g">SPECTRE</span>.’ Bond paused. He avoided Leiter’s eyes. ‘That is,
unless he’s managed to get information out of the girl.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter said staunchly, ‘Hell, I don’t believe that girl would
talk. She’s a tough cookie. And supposing she did? He’s only
got to drop her overboard with some lead round her neck
and say her aqualung failed on the treasure hunt, or some spiel
of that sort. He’d go back to Nassau all right. That man’s
cover’s as solid as J. P. Morgan and Company.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The captain interrupted. ‘Leaving all that aside, Commander
Bond, and sticking to the operational angles, how do
you suggest he’s going to get that bomb out of the ship and
right into the target area? I agree that according to the charts
he can’t get much closer in the yacht, and if he did he might
be in trouble with the waterfront guard at the missile station.
I see from my dope on the place that they’ve got some kind of
a guard-boat for chasing away fishermen and suchlike when
they’re going to do a practice shoot.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said decisively, ‘I’m sure that’s the real purpose of the
underwater compartment in the <span class="it">Disco</span>. They’ve got one of
those underwater sleds in there, and probably an electric
torpedo to haul it. They’ll load the bomb on the sled and take
it in with a team of underwater swimmers, lay it and come
back to the ship. Otherwise, why have all that underwater
gear?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The captain said slowly, ‘You may be right, Commander. It
makes sense. But so what do you want me to do about it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked the captain in the eye. ‘There’s only one
moment to nail these people. If we show our hand too soon, the
<span class="it">Disco</span> can get the hell away—only a few hundred yards maybe,
and dump the bombs in a hundred fathoms. The only time to
get them, and the bomb, the first bomb anyway, is when that
team has left the ship and is on its way to the laying point.
We’ve got to get their underwater team with our underwater
team. The second bomb, if it’s aboard, doesn’t matter. We
can sink the ship with the second bomb inside her.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The captain looked down at his plate. He arranged the knife
and fork tidily together, straightened the dessert spoon and
took the remains of his iced coffee and swirled the fragments of
ice round so that they tinkled. He put the glass back on the
table and looked up, first at Leiter then at Bond. He said
thoughtfully, ‘I guess what you say makes sense, Commander.
We have plenty of oxygen rebreathers on board. We also have
ten of the finest swimmers in the Nuclear Flotilla. But they’ll
only have knives to fight with. I’ll have to ask for volunteers.’
He paused. ‘Who’s going to lead them?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, ‘I’ll do that. Skin-diving happens to be one of my
hobbies. And I know what fish to look out for and which ones
not to mind about. I’ll brief your men about those things.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Felix Leiter interrupted. He said obstinately, ‘And don’t
think you’re going to leave me behind eating Virginia ham. I
put an extra foot-flipper on this,’ he held up the shining hook,
‘and I’ll race you over half a mile any day, gammy leg and all.
You’d be surprised the things one gets around to improvise
when someone chews off one of your arms. Compensation it’s
called by the medics, in case you hadn’t heard about it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The captain smiled. He got to his feet. ‘Okay, okay. I’ll leave
you two heroes to fight it out while I have a word to the men
over the speaker system. Then we’ll have to get together with
the charts and see that the gear’s okay and suchlike. You fellers
aren’t going to get any sleep after all. I’ll have a ration of battle
pills issued to you. You’re going to need them.’ He raised a
hand and went off down the mess hall.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter turned to Bond. ‘You goddam shyster. Thought you
were going to leave your old pal behind, didn’t you? God, the
treachery of you Limeys! Perfidious Albion is right, all right.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. ‘How the hell was I to know you’d been in the
hands of rehabilitators and therapists and so on? I never knew
you took life so seriously. I suppose you’ve even found some
way of petting with that damned meathook of yours.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter said darkly, ‘You’d be surprised. Get a girl round the
arm with this and you’d be amazed the effect it has on their
good resolutions. Now then, let’s get down to cases. What sort
of formation are we going to swim in? Can we get some of
those knives made into lances? How are we going to recognize
our side from theirs underwater, and in semi-darkness at that?
We’ve got to make this operation pretty solid. That Pedersen’s
a good guy. We don’t want to get some of his men killed
through some damn silly mistake of ours.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The voice of the captain sounded over the communication
system. ‘Now hear this. This is your Captain speaking. It is
possible that we may encounter hazards in the course of this
operation. I will tell you how this may come about. This
ship has been chosen by the Navy Department for an exercise
that is tantamount to an operation of war. I will tell you the
story, which will remain classified top secret until further
orders. This is what has happened . . .’</p>

<p class="line10">★</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond, asleep in one of the duty officers’ bunks, was awakened
by the alarm bell. The iron voice of the PA System said:
‘Diving stations. Diving stations,’ and almost at once his bunk
tilted slightly and the distant whine of the engines altered
pitch. Bond smiled grimly to himself. He slipped off the bunk
and went along and up to the attack centre. Felix Leiter was
already there. The captain turned away from the plot. His face
was tense. He said, ‘It looks as if you were right, gentlemen.
We’ve got her all right. About five miles ahead and two points
to starboard. She’s doing around thirty knots. No other ship
could be holding that speed, or would be likely to. And she’s
showing no lights. Here, care to have a look through the scope?
She’s raising quite a wake and kicking up plenty of phosphorescence.
No moon yet, but you’ll see the white blur
when your eyes get used to the dark.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond bent to the rubber eye sockets. In a minute he had her,
a white scut on the horizon of the soft, feathery swell. He stood
back. ‘What’s her course?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Same as ours—western end of Grand Bahama. We’ll go
deeper now and put on a bit of speed. We’ve got her on the
Sonar as well, so we shan’t lose her. We’ll get up parallel and
close in a bit later. The met. report gives a light westerly
breeze in the early hours. That’d be a help. Don’t want it too
calm when we unload the swimming party. The surface’ll
boil quite a bit as each man goes out. Here,’ he turned to a
powerful-looking man in white ducks, ‘this is Petty Officer
Fallon. He’s in command of the swimming party, under your
and Mr Leiter’s orders of course. All the top swimmers
volunteered. He’s chosen nine of them. I’ve taken them off all
duties. Maybe you gentlemen would like to get acquainted
with your team. You’ll want to discuss your routines. I guess
discipline’ll have to be pretty tight—recognition signals and
so forth. Okay? The sergeant at arms is looking after the
weapons.’ He smiled. ‘He’s rustled up a dozen flick knives.
Had some difficulty persuading the men to give them up, but
he’s done it. He’s barbed them and sharpened them down
almost to needles then fitted them into the tops of broom
handles. Guess he’ll make you sign an indent for the brooms
or he’ll have the supply officer on top of him when we get out
of this. All right then. Be seeing you. Ask for anything you
want.’ He turned back to the plot.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond and Leiter followed Petty Officer Fallon along the
lower deck to the engine room and then to the engine repair
shop. On their way they passed through the reactor room. The
reactor, the equivalent of a controlled atomic bomb, was an
obscene knee-level bulge rising out of the thickly leaded deck.
As they passed it, Leiter whispered to Bond, ‘Liquid sodium
Submarine Intermediate Reactor Mark B.’ He grinned sourly
and crossed himself.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gave the thing a sideway kick with his shoe. ‘Steam-age
stuff. Our Navy’s got the Mark C.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The repair shop, a long low room equipped with various
forms of precision machinery, presented a curious sight. At
one end were grouped the nine swimmers clad only in bathing
trunks, their fine bodies glowing with sunburn. At the other,
two men in grey overalls, drab figures of the machine age, were
working in semi-darkness with only pinpoints of bright light
cast on the whirring lathes from which the knife blades threw
small fountains of blue and orange sparks. Some of the
swimmers already had their spears. After the introductions,
Bond took one and examined it. It was a deadly weapon, the
blade, sharpened to a stiletto and notched near the top into a
barb, firmly wired into the top of a long stout stave. Bond
thumbed the needle-sharp steel and touched the tip. Even a
shark’s skin would not stand up to that. But what would the
enemy have? CO2 guns for a certainty. Bond looked the
smiling bronzed young men over. There were going to be
casualties—perhaps many. Everything must be done to effect
surprise. But those golden skins and his own and Leiter’s
paler skins would show at twenty feet in the moonlight—all
right for the guns, but well out of range of the spears. Bond
turned to Petty Officer Fallon: ‘I suppose you don’t have
rubber suits on board?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Why sure, Commander. Have to, for escape in cold waters.’
He smiled. ‘We’re not always sailing among the palm trees.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We’ll all need them. And could you get white or yellow
numbers, big ones, painted on their backs? Then we’ll know
more or less who’s who.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sure, sure.’ He called to his men. ‘Hey, Fonda and Johnson.
Go along to the Quartermaster, and draw rubber suits for the
whole team. Bracken, get a pail of rubber solution paint from
Stores. Paint numbers on the backs of the suits. A foot deep.
From one to twelve. Get going.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Later, with the gleaming black suits hanging like giant bat-skins
along the wall, Bond called the team together. ‘Men,
we’re going to have one hell of an underwater battle. There’ll
be casualties. Anyone care to change his mind?’ The faces
grinned back at him. ‘All right then. Now, we’ll be swimming
at around ten feet for a quarter, perhaps half a mile. It’ll be
pretty light. The moon’ll be up and the bottom’s white sand
with some seagrass. We’ll take it easy and go in triangle
formation with me, No 1, leading followed by Mr Leiter here
as No 2, and Petty Officer Fallon as No 3. Then we broaden
out behind like a wedge of geese. All you have to do is follow
the number in front of you and no one’ll get lost. Watch out
for isolated niggerheads. As far as I can gather from the chart
there’s no true reef, only broken clumps. It’ll be getting on
for early feeding time for the fish, so watch out for anything
big. But leave it alone unless it gets too inquisitive. Then
three of you take it on with the spears. But don’t forget that
it’s most unlikely any fish will attack us. Close together we’ll
look like one hell of a big black fish to anyone else and I guess
we’ll be given a wide berth. Watch out for sea eggs on the
coral and mind the tips of your spears. Hold them right up
near the blade. Above all, keep quiet. We must try and get
surprise on our side. The enemy’s got CO2 guns, range
about twenty feet. But they’re slow things to reload. If one’s
aimed at you, try and give a small target. Keep flat in the water.
Don’t put your feet down and give him a full-length target. As
soon as he’s fired, go for him like hell with your spear right out.
One jab of those things in almost any part of the head or body
and your man’s had it. Wounded men will have to look after
themselves. We can’t spare stretcher bearers. If you’re
wounded, back out of the fight and get away to a coral clump
and rest on it. Or make for the shore and shallow water.
If you’ve got a spear in you don’t try and pull it out. Just
hold it in the wound until someone gets to you. Petty Officer
Fallon will have one of the ship’s signal flares. He’ll release
that to the surface as soon as our attack begins and your
Captain will at once surface and put out an escape dinghy
with an armed party and the ship’s surgeon. Now then, any
questions?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What do we do as soon as we get out of the sub, sir?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Try and not make any fuss on the surface. Get down quickly
to ten feet and take your place in the formation. We’re likely
to get help from a light breeze, but we’re bound to create
turbulence on the surface. Keep it down as much as you can.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What about signals underwater, sir. Suppose a mask goes
wrong or something.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thumbs down for any kind of emergency. Arm held straight
out for a big fish. Thumbs up means “I understand” or
“Coming to help you”. That’s all you’ll need.’ Bond smiled.
‘If the feet go up, that’s the signal that you’ve had it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The men laughed various kinds of laugh.</p>

<p class="pindent">There came the sudden voice of the PA System. ‘Swimming
party to the escape hatch. I repeat, swimming party to the
escape hatch. Don equipment. Don equipment. Commander
Bond to the Attack Centre, please.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The whine of the engines died to a moan and then was
silent. There was a slight bump as the <span class="it">Manta</span> hit bottom.</p>
