<h3 class="calibre10"><span class="it1">Shrublands</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">J</span>ames Bond</span> slung his suitcase into the back of the old
chocolate-brown Austin taxi and climbed into the front seat
beside the foxy, pimpled young man in the black leather
windcheater. The young man took a comb out of his breast
pocket, ran it carefully through both sides of his duck-tail
haircut, put the comb back in his pocket, then leaned forward
and pressed the self-starter. The play with the comb, Bond
guessed, was to assert to Bond that the driver was really only
taking him and his money as a favour. It was typical of the
cheap self-assertiveness of young labour since the war. This
youth, thought Bond, makes about twenty pounds a week,
despises his parents, and would like to be Tommy Steele.
It’s not his fault. He was born into the buyers’ market of the
Welfare State and into the age of atomic bombs and space
flight. For him life is easy and meaningless. Bond said, ‘How
far is it to “Shrublands”?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The young man did an expert but unnecessary racing change
round an island and changed up again. ‘ ’Bout half an hour.’ He
put his foot down on the accelerator and neatly but rather
dangerously overtook a lorry at an intersection.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You certainly get the most out of your Bluebird.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The young man glanced sideways to see if he was being
laughed at. He decided that he wasn’t. He unbent fractionally.
‘My dad won’t spring me something better. Says this old crate
was okay for him for twenty years so it’s got to be okay for me
for another twenty. So I’m putting money by on my own. Half
way there already.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond decided that the comb-play had made him over-censorious.
He said, ‘What are you going to get?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Volkswagen Minibus. Do the Brighton races.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That sounds a good idea. Plenty of money in Brighton.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ll say.’ The young man showed a trace of enthusiasm.
‘Only time I ever got there, a couple of bookies had me take
them and a couple of tarts to London. Ten quid and a fiver tip.
Piece of cake.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Certainly was. But you can get both kinds at Brighton. You
want to watch out for being mugged and rolled. There are some
tough gangs operating out of Brighton. What’s happened to the
Bucket of Blood these days?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Never opened up again after that case they had. The one
that got in all the papers.’ The young man realized that he was
talking as if to an equal. He glanced sideways and looked Bond
up and down with a new interest. ‘You going into the Scrubs or
just visiting?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Scrubs?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Shrublands—Wormwood Scrubs—Scrubs,’ said the
young man laconically. ‘You’re not like the usual ones I get
to take there. Mostly fat women and old geezers who
tell me not to drive so fast or it’ll shake up their sciatica or
something.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. ‘I’ve got fourteen days without the option.
Doctor thinks it’ll do me good. Got to take it easy. What do
they think of the place round here?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The young man took the turning off the Brighton road and
drove westwards under the Downs through Poynings and
Fulking. The Austin whined stolidly through the inoffensive
countryside. ‘People think they’re a lot of crackpots. Don’t care
for the place. All those rich folk and they don’t spend any
money in the area. Tea-rooms make a bit out of them—specially
out of the cheats.’ He looked at Bond. ‘You’d be
surprised. Grown people, some of them pretty big shots in the
City and so forth, and they motor around in their Bentleys
with their bellies empty and they see a tea-shop and go in just
for their cups of tea. That’s all they’re allowed. Next thing,
they see some guy eating buttered toast and sugar cakes at
the next table and they can’t stand it. They order mounds of
the stuff and hog it down just like kids who’ve broken into the
larder—looking round all the time to see if they’ve been
spotted. You’d think people like that would be ashamed of
themselves.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Seems a bit silly when they’re paying plenty to take the cure
or whatever it is.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And that’s another thing,’ the young man’s voice was indignant.
‘I can understand charging twenty quid a week and giving
you three square meals a day, but how do they get away with
charging twenty quid for giving you nothing but hot water to
eat? Doesn’t make sense.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I suppose there are the treatments. And it must be worth it
to the people if they get well.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Guess so,’ said the young man doubtfully. ‘Some of them do
look a bit different when I come to take them back to the
station.’ He sniggered. ‘And some of them change into real old
goats after a week of nuts and so forth. Guess I might try it
myself one day.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What do you mean?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The young man glanced at Bond. Reassured and remembering
Bond’s worldly comments on Brighton, he said, ‘Well, you
see we got a girl here in Washington. Racy bird. Sort of local
tart if you see what I mean. Waitress at a place called the
Honey Bee Tea Shop—or was, rather. She started most of us
off, if you get my meaning. Quid a go and she knows a lot of
French tricks. Regular sport. Well, this year the word got
round up at the Scrubs and some of these old goats began
patronizing Polly—Polly Grace, that’s her name. Took her
out in their Bentleys and gave her a roll in a deserted quarry up
on the Downs. That’s been her pitch for years. Trouble was they
paid her five, ten quid and she soon got too good for the likes
of us. Priced her out of our market, so to speak. Inflation, sort of.
And a month ago she chucked up her job at the Honey Bee,
and you know what?’ The young man’s voice was loud with
indignation. ‘She bought herself a beat-up Austin Metropolitan
for a couple of hundred quid and went mobile. Just like the
London tarts in Curzon Street they talk about in the papers.
Now she’s off to Brighton, Lewes—anywhere she can find the
sports, and in between while she goes to work in the quarry
with these old goats from the Scrubs! Would you believe it!’
The young man gave an angry blast on his klaxon at an
inoffensive couple on a tandem bicycle.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said seriously, ‘That’s too bad. I wouldn’t have thought
these people would be interested in that sort of thing on nut
cutlets and dandelion wine or whatever they get to eat at this
place.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The young man snorted. ‘That’s all you know. I mean’—he
felt he had been too emphatic—‘that’s what we all thought. One
of my pals, he’s the son of the local doctor, talked the thing over
with his dad—in a roundabout way, sort of. And his dad said
no. He said that this sort of diet and no drink and plenty of rest,
what with the massage and the hot and cold sitz baths and what
have you, he said that all clears the blood-stream and tones up
the system, if you get my meaning. Wakes the old goats up—make
’em want to start cutting the mustard again, if you know
the song by that Rosemary Clooney.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. He said, ‘Well, well. Perhaps there’s something
to the place after all.’</p>

<p class="pindent">A sign on the right of the road said ‘ “<span class="it">Shrublands</span>”. <span class="it">Gateway
to Health. First right. Silence please.</span>’ The road ran through a
wide belt of firs and evergreens in a fold of the Downs. A high
wall appeared and then an imposing, mock-battlemented
entrance with a Victorian lodge from which a thin wisp of
smoke rose straight up among the quiet trees. The young man
turned in and followed a gravel sweep between thick laurel
bushes. An elderly couple cringed off the drive at a blare from
his klaxon and then on the right there were broad stretches of
lawn and neatly flowered borders and a sprinkling of slowly
moving figures, alone and in pairs, and behind them a red brick
Victorian monstrosity from which a long glass sun-parlour
extended to the edge of the grass.</p>

<p class="pindent">The young man pulled up beneath a heavy portico with a
crenellated roof. Beside a varnished, iron-studded arched door
stood a tall glazed urn above which a notice said: ‘<span class="it">No smoking
inside. Cigarettes here please.</span>’ Bond got down from the taxi and
pulled his suitcase out of the back. He gave the young man a
ten-shilling tip. The young man accepted it as no less than his
due. He said, ‘Thanks. You ever want to break out, you can call
me up. Polly’s not the only one. And there’s a tea-shop on the
Brighton road has buttered muffins. So long.’ He banged the
gears into bottom and ground off back the way he had come.
Bond picked up his suitcase and walked resignedly up the steps
and through the heavy door.</p>

<p class="pindent">Inside it was very warm and quiet. At the reception desk in
the big oak-panelled hall a severely pretty girl in starched
white welcomed him briskly. When he had signed the register
she led him through a series of sombrely furnished public
rooms and down a neutral-smelling white corridor to the back
of the building. Here there was a communicating door with the
annex, a long low cheaply-built structure with rooms on both
sides of a central passage. The doors bore the names of flowers
and shrubs. She showed him into Myrtle, told him that ‘The
Chief’ would see him in an hour’s time, at six o’clock, and
left him.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a room-shaped room with furniture-shaped furniture,
and dainty curtains. The bed was provided with an electric
blanket. There was a vase containing three marigolds beside the
bed and a book called <span class="it">Nature Cure Explained</span> by Alan Moyle,
<span class="g">MBNA</span>. Bond opened it and ascertained that the initials stood
for ‘Member: British Naturopathic Association’. He turned off
the central heating and opened the windows wide. The herb
garden, row upon row of small nameless plants round a central
sundial, smiled up at him. Bond unpacked his things and sat
down in the single armchair and read about eliminating the
waste products from his body. He learned a great deal about
foods he had never heard of, such as Potassium Broth, Nut
Mince, and the mysteriously named Unmalted Slippery Elm.
He had got as far as the chapter on massage and was reflecting
on the injunction that this art should be divided into Effleurage,
Stroking, Friction, Kneading, Petrissage, Tapotement, and
Vibration, when the telephone rang. A girl’s voice said that Mr
Wain would be glad to see him in Consulting Room A in
five minutes.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Joshua Wain had a firm, dry handshake and a resonant,
encouraging voice. He had a lot of bushy grey hair above an
unlined brow, soft, clear brown eyes, and a sincere and Christian
smile. He appeared to be genuinely pleased to see Bond
and to be interested in him. He wore a very clean smock-like
coat with short sleeves from which strong hairy arms hung
relaxed. Below were rather incongruous pin-stripe trousers. He
wore sandals over socks of conservative grey and when he
moved across the consulting-room his stride was a springy lope.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Wain asked Bond to remove all his clothes except his
pants. When he saw the many scars he said politely, ‘Dear me,
you do seem to have been in the wars, Mr Bond.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said indifferently, ‘Near miss. During the war.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Really! War between peoples is a terrible thing. Now, just
breathe in deeply, please.’ Mr Wain listened at Bond’s back and
chest, took his blood pressure, weighed him and recorded his
height, and then, after asking him to lie face down on a surgical
couch, handled his joints and vertebrae with soft, probing
fingers.</p>

<p class="pindent">While Bond replaced his clothes, Mr Wain wrote busily at
his desk. Then he sat back. ‘Well, Mr Bond, nothing much to
worry about here, I think. Blood pressure a little high, slight
osteopathic lesions in the upper vertebrae—they’ll probably be
causing your tension headaches, by the way—and some right
sacroiliac strain with the right ilium slightly displaced backwards.
Due to a bad fall some time, no doubt.’ Mr Wain raised
his eyes for confirmation.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, ‘Perhaps.’ Inwardly he reflected that the ‘bad
fall’ had probably been when he had had to jump from the
Arlberg Express after Heinkel and his friends had caught
up with him around the time of the Hungarian uprising
in 1956.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well now.’ Mr Wain drew a printed form towards him and
thoughtfully ticked off items on a list. ‘Strict dieting for one
week to eliminate the toxins in the blood-stream. Massage to
tone you up, irrigation, hot and cold Sitz baths, osteopathic
treatment and a short course of Traction to get rid of the
lesions. That should put you right. And complete rest, of
course. Just take it easy, Mr Bond. You’re a civil servant, I
understand. Do you good to get away from all that worrying
paper-work for a while.’ Mr Wain got up and handed the
printed form to Bond. ‘Treatment rooms in half an hour, Mr
Bond. No harm in starting right away.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thank you.’ Bond took the form and glanced at it. ‘What’s
Traction, by the way?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A mechanical device for stretching the spine. Very beneficial.’
Mr Wain smiled indulgently. ‘Don’t be worried by what
some of the other patients tell you about it. They call it “The
Rack”. You know what wags some people are.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked out and along the white painted corridor. People
were sitting about, reading or talking in soft tones in the public
rooms. They were all elderly, middle-class people, mostly
women, many of whom wore unattractive quilted dressing-gowns.
The warm, close air and the frumpish women gave
Bond claustrophobia. He walked through the hall to the main
door and let himself out into the wonderful fresh air.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked thoughtfully down the trim narrow drive and
smelled the musty smell of the laurels and the laburnums.
Could he stand it? Was there any way out of this hell-hole
short of resigning from the Service? Deep in thought, he
almost collided with a girl in white who came hurrying round a
sharp bend in the thickly hedged drive. At the same instant as
she swerved out of his path and flashed him an amused smile, a
mauve Bentley, taking the corner too fast, was on top of her. At
one moment she was almost under its wheels, at the next,
Bond, with one swift step, had gathered her up by the waist
and, executing a passable Veronica, with a sharp swivel of his
hips had picked her body literally off the bonnet of the car. He
put the girl down as the Bentley dry-skidded to a stop in the
gravel. His right hand held the memory of one beautiful breast.
The girl said ‘Oh!’ and looked up into his eyes with an expression
of flurried astonishment. Then she took in what had
happened and said breathlessly, ‘Oh, thank you.’ She turned
towards the car. A man had climbed unhurriedly down from
the driving-seat. He said calmly, ‘I am so sorry. Are you all
right?’ Recognition dawned on his face. He said silkily, ‘Why,
if it isn’t my friend Patricia? How are you, Pat? All ready
for me?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The man was extremely handsome—a dark bronzed woman-killer
with a neat moustache above the sort of callous mouth
women kiss in their dreams. He had regular features that suggested
Spanish or South American blood and bold, hard brown
eyes that turned up oddly, or, as a woman would put it, intriguingly,
at the corners. He was an athletic-looking six foot,
dressed in the sort of casually well-cut beige herring-bone
tweed that suggests Anderson and Sheppard. He wore a white
silk shirt and a dark red polka-dot tie, and the soft-dark brown
V-necked sweater looked like vicuna. Bond summed him up as a
good-looking bastard who got all the women he wanted and
probably lived on them—and lived well.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl had recovered her poise. She said severely, ‘You
really ought to be more careful, Count Lippe. You know there
are always patients and staff walking down this drive. If it
hadn’t been for this gentleman,’ she smiled at Bond, ‘you’d
have run me over. After all, there <span class="it">is</span> a big sign asking drivers
to take care.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I am so sorry, my dear. I was hurrying. I am late for my
appointment with the good Mr Wain. I am as usual in need of
decarbonization—this time after two weeks in Paris.’ He turned
to Bond. He said with a hint of condescension, ‘Thank you, my
dear sir. You have quick reactions. And now, if you will forgive
me—’ He raised a hand, got back into the Bentley, and purred
off up the drive.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl said, ‘Now I really must hurry. I’m terribly late.’
Together they turned and walked after the Bentley.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, examining her, ‘Do you work here?’ She said
that she did. She had been at Shrublands for three years.
She liked it. And how long was he staying? The small-talk
continued.</p>

<p class="pindent">She was an athletic-looking girl whom Bond would have
casually associated with tennis, or skating, or show-jumping.
She had the sort of firm, compact figure that always attracted
him and a fresh open-air type of prettiness that would have
been common-place but for a wide, rather passionate mouth
and a hint of authority that would be a challenge to men. She
was dressed in a feminine version of the white smock worn by
Mr Wain, and it was clear from the undisguised curves of her
breasts and hips that she had little on underneath it. Bond
asked her if she didn’t get bored. What did she do with her
time off?</p>

<p class="pindent">She acknowledged the gambit with a smile and a quick glance
of appraisal. ‘I’ve got one of those bubble cars. I get about the
country quite a lot. And there are wonderful walks. And one’s
always seeing new people here. Some of them are very interesting.
That man in the car, Count Lippe. He comes here every
year. He tells me fascinating things about the Far East—China
and so on. He’s got some sort of a business in a place called
Macao. It’s near Hong Kong, isn’t it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, that’s right.’ So those turned-up eyes were a dash of
Chinaman. It would be interesting to know his background.
Probably Portuguese blood if he came from Macao.</p>

<p class="pindent">They had reached the entrance. Inside the warm hall the girl
said, ‘Well, I must run. Thank you again.’ She gave him a smile
that, for the benefit of the watching receptionist, was entirely
neutral. ‘I hope you enjoy your stay.’ She hurried off towards
the treatment rooms. Bond followed, his eyes on the taut swell
of her hips. He glanced at his watch and also went down the
stairs and into a spotlessly white basement that smelled faintly
of olive oil and Aerosol disinfectant.</p>

<p class="pindent">Beyond a door marked ‘Gentlemen’s Treatment’ he was
taken in hand by an indiarubbery masseur in trousers and
singlet. Bond undressed and with a towel round his waist
followed the man down a long room divided into compartments
by plastic curtains. In the first compartment, side by side, two
elderly men lay, the perspiration pouring down their strawberry
faces, in electric blanket-baths. In the next were two
massage tables. On one, the pale, dimpled body of a youngish
but very fat man wobbled obscenely beneath the pummelling
of his masseur. Bond, his mind recoiling from it all, took off his
towel and lay down on his face and surrendered himself to the
toughest deep massage he had ever experienced.</p>

<p class="pindent">Vaguely, against the jangling of his nerves and the aching of
muscles and tendons, he heard the fat man heave himself off his
table and, moments later, another patient take his place. He
heard the man’s masseur say, ‘I’m afraid we’ll have to have the
wrist-watch off, sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The urbane, silky voice that Bond at once recognized said
with authority, ‘Nonsense, my dear fellow. I come here every
year and I’ve always been allowed to keep it on before. I’d
rather keep it on, if you don’t mind.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sorry, sir.’ The masseur’s voice was politely firm. ‘You must
have had someone else doing the treatment. It interferes with
the flow of blood when I come to treat the arm and hand. If
you don’t mind, sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a moment’s silence. Bond could almost feel Count
Lippe controlling his temper. The words, when they came,
were spat out with what seemed to Bond ludicrous violence.
‘Take it off then.’ The ‘Damn you’ didn’t have to be uttered.
It hung in the air at the end of the sentence.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thank you, sir.’ There was a brief pause and then the
massage began.</p>

<p class="pindent">The small incident seemed odd to Bond. Obviously one had
to take off one’s wrist-watch for a massage. Why had the man
wanted to keep it on? It seemed very childish.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Turn over, please sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond obeyed. Now his face was free to move. He glanced
casually to his right. Count Lippe’s face was turned away from
him. His left arm hung down towards the floor. Where the sunburn
ended, there was a bracelet of almost white flesh at the
wrist. In the middle of the circle where the watch had been
there was a sign tattooed in red on the skin. It looked like a
small zigzag crossed by two vertical strokes. So Count Lippe
had not wanted this sign to be seen! It would be amusing to
ring up Records and see if they had a line on what sort of people
wore this little secret recognition sign under their wristwatches.</p>
