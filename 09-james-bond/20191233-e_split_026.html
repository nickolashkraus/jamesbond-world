<h3 class="calibre10"><span class="it1">When the Kissing Stopped</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">B</span>ond</span> <span class="lead-in">leant</span> on one elbow and looked down at the beautiful
drowned face. There was a dew of sweat below the
eyes and at the temples. A pulse beat fast at the base of
the neck. The lines of authority had been sponged away by
the lovemaking and the face had a soft, sweet, bruised look.
The wet eyelashes parted and the tawny eyes, big and faraway,
looked up with remote curiosity into Bond’s. They focused
lazily and examined him as if they were seeing him for the
first time.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, ‘I’m sorry. I shouldn’t have done that.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The words amused her. The dimples at each side of the
mouth deepened into clefts. She said, ‘You talk like a girl who
has had it for the first time. Now you are frightened that you
will have a baby. You will have to tell your mother.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond leant down and kissed her. He kissed the two corners
of her mouth and then the parted lips. He said, ‘Come and
swim. Then I must talk to you.’ He got to his feet and held out
his hands. Reluctantly she took them. He pulled her up and
against him. Her body flirted with his, knowing it was safe.
She smiled impishly up at him and became more wanton. Bond
crushed her fiercely to him, to stop her and because he knew
they had only a few more minutes of happiness. He said,
‘Stop it, Domino. And come on. We don’t need any clothes.
The sand won’t hurt your foot. I was only pretending.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She said, ‘So was I when I came out of the sea. The
spines didn’t hurt all that much. And I could have cured
them if I’d wanted to. Like the fishermen do. You know
how?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. ‘Yes I do. Now, into the sea.’ He kissed her
once and stood back and looked at her body to remember how it
had been. Then he turned abruptly and ran to the sea and
dived deeply down.</p>

<p class="pindent">When he got back to shore she was already out and dressing.
Bond dried himself. He answered her laughing remarks
through the partition with monosyllables. Finally she accepted
the change in him. She said, ‘What is the matter with you,
James? Is anything wrong?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, darling.’ Pulling on his trousers Bond heard the rattle
of the little gold chain against the coins in his pocket. He said,
‘Come outside. I’ve got to talk to you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Sentimentally, Bond chose a patch of sand on the other side
of the hut from where they had been before. She came out and
stood in front of him. She examined his face carefully, trying
to read it. Bond avoided her eyes. He sat with his arms round
his knees and looked out to sea. She sat down beside him, but
not close. She said, ‘You are going to hurt me. Is it that you
too are going away? Be quick. Do it cleanly and I will not cry.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, ‘I’m afraid it’s worse than that, Domino. It’s
not about me. It’s about your brother.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sensed the stiffening of her body. She said in a low,
tense voice, ‘Go on. Tell me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took the bracelet out of his pocket and silently handed
it to her.</p>

<p class="pindent">She took it. She hardly gave it a glance. She turned a little
away from Bond. ‘So he is dead. What happened to him?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It is a bad story, and a very big one. It involves your friend
Largo. It is a very great conspiracy. I am here to find out
things for my government. I am really a kind of policeman. I
am telling you this and I will tell you the rest because hundreds
and perhaps thousands of people will die unless you help to
prevent it. That is why I had to show you that bracelet and
hurt you so that you would believe me. I am breaking my oath
in doing this. Whatever happens, whatever you decide to do,
I trust you not to tell what I am going to say.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So that is why you made love to me—to make me do what
you want. And now you blackmail me with the death of my
brother.’ The words came out between her teeth. Now in a soft,
deadly whisper, she said, ‘I hate you, I hate you, I hate you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said coldly, in a matter-of-fact voice, ‘Your brother was
killed by Largo, or on his orders. I came here to tell you that.
But then,’ he hesitated, ‘you were there and I love you and want
you. When what happened began to happen I should have had
strength to stop it. I hadn’t. I knew it was then or perhaps
never. Knowing what I knew, it was a dreadful thing to have
done. But you looked so beautiful and happy. I wanted to put
off hurting you. That is my only excuse.’ Bond paused. ‘Now
listen to what I have to tell you. Try and forget about your
hate for me. In a moment you will realize that we are nothing
in all this. This is a thing by itself.’ Bond didn’t wait for her to
comment. He began from the beginning and went slowly,
minutely, through the whole case, omitting only the advent
of the <span class="it">Manta</span>, the one factor that could now be of help to
Largo and perhaps alter his plans. He ended, ‘So you see, there
is nothing we can do until those weapons are actually on board
the <span class="it">Disco</span>. Until that moment comes, Largo has a perfect alibi
with his treasure hunt story. There is nothing to link him with
the crashed plane or with <span class="g">SPECTRE</span>. If we interfere with him
now, this moment, arrest the ship on some excuse, put a watch
on her, prevent her sailing, there will only be a delay in the
<span class="g">SPECTRE</span> plan. Only Largo and his men know where the
bombs are hidden. If the plane has gone for them, it will be
keeping contact with the <span class="it">Disco</span> by radio. If there’s any hitch,
the plane can leave the bombs at the hiding place or at another,
dump them in shallow water anywhere, and return for them
when the trouble has blown over. Even the <span class="it">Disco</span> could be
taken off the job and some other ship or plane used any time
in the future. <span class="g">SPECTRE</span> headquarters, wherever they are, will
inform the Prime Minister that there has been a change of plan,
or they can say nothing at all. Then, perhaps weeks from now,
they will send another communication. And this time there
will perhaps be only twenty-four hours’ notice for the money to
be dropped. The terms will be tougher. And we shall have to
accept them. So long as those bombs are still lost to us, the
threat is there. You see that?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes. So what is to be done?’ The voice was harsh. The girl’s
eyes glittered fiercely as they looked at and through Bond
towards some distant target—not, he thought, at Largo the
great conspirator, but at Largo who had had her brother killed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We have got to know when those bombs are on board the
<span class="it">Disco</span>. That is all that matters. Then we can act with all our
weight. And we have one great factor on our side. We are pretty
sure that Largo feels secure. He still believes that the wonderful
plan, and it is wonderful, is going exactly as it was meant to do.
That is our strength and our only strength. You see that?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And how are you to know when the bombs come on board
the yacht?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You must tell us.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes.’ The monosyllable was dull, indifferent. ‘But how am I
to know? And how am I to tell you? This man is no fool. He is
only foolish in wanting his mistress’—she spat the word out—‘when
so much else is at stake.’ She paused. ‘These people have
chosen badly. Largo cannot live without a woman within reach.
They should have known that.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘When did Largo tell you to come back on board?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Five. The boat is coming to fetch me at Palmyra.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked at his watch. ‘It is now four. I have this Geiger
counter. It is simple to use. It will tell at once if the bombs are
on board. I want you to take it with you. If it says there is a
bomb on board, I want you to show a light at your porthole—switch
the lights on in your cabin several times, anything like
that. We have men watching the ship. They will be told to report.
Then get rid of the Geiger counter. Drop it overboard.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She said scornfully, ‘That is a silly plan. It is the sort of
melodramatic nonsense people write about in thrillers. In real
life people don’t go into their cabins and switch on their lights
in daylight. No. If the bombs are there, I will come up on
deck—show myself to your men. That is natural behaviour. If
they are not there, I will stay in my cabin.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right. Have it your own way. But will you do this?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course. If I can prevent myself killing Largo when I see
him. But on condition that when you get him you will see that
he is killed.’ She was entirely serious. She looked at him with
matter-of-fact eyes as if he was a travel agent and she was
reserving a seat on a train.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I doubt if that will happen. I should say that every man on
board will get a life sentence in prison.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She considered this. ‘Yes. That will do. That is worse than
being killed. Now show me how this machine works.’ She got
to her feet and took a couple of steps up the beach. She seemed
to remember something. She looked down at the bracelet in
her hand. She turned and walked down to the edge of the sea
and stood for a moment looking out across the quiet water. She
said some words that Bond couldn’t hear. Then she leant back
and with all her strength threw the gold chain far out over
the shoal into the dark blue. The chain twinkled briefly in the
strong sun and there was a small splash. She watched the
ripples widen and, when the smashed mirror was whole again,
turned and walked back up the sand, her small limp leaving
footmarks of uneven depth.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond showed her the working of the machine. He eliminated
the wrist-watch indicator and told her to depend entirely on the
telltale clicking. ‘Anywhere in the ship should be all right,’ he
explained. ‘But better near the hold if you can get there. Say
you want to take a photograph from the well-deck aft or something.
This thing’s made up to look like a Rolleiflex. It’s got all
the Rolleiflex lenses and gadgets on the front, lever to press
and all. It just hasn’t got a film. You could say that you’d
decided to take some farewell pictures of Nassau and the yacht,
couldn’t you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes.’ The girl, who had been listening attentively, now
seemed distracted. Tentatively she put out a hand and touched
Bond’s arm. She let the hand fall. She looked up at him and
then swiftly away. She said shyly, ‘What I said, what I said
about hating you. That is not true. I didn’t understand. How
could I—all this terrible story? I still can’t quite believe it,
believe that Largo has anything to do with it. We had a sort
of an affair in Capri. He is an attractive man. Everyone else
wanted him. It was a challenge to take him from all these other
smart women. Then he explained about the yacht and this
wonderful trip looking for treasure. It was like a fairy tale.
Of course I agreed to come. Who wouldn’t have? In exchange,
I was quite ready to do what I had to do.’ She looked briefly
at him and away. ‘I am sorry. But that is how it is. When we
got to Nassau and he kept me ashore, away from the yacht,
I was surprised but I was not offended. The islands are
beautiful. There was enough for me to do. But what you have
told me explains many small things. I was never allowed in
the radio room. The crew were silent and unfriendly—they
treated me like someone who was not wanted on board, and
they were on curious terms with Largo, more like equals than
paid men. And they were tough men and better educated than
sailors usually are. So it all fits. I can even remember that, for
a whole week before last Thursday, Largo was terribly
nervous and irritable. We were already getting tired of each
other. I put it down to that. I was even making plans for flying
home by myself. But he has been better the last few days and
when he told me to be packed and ready to come on board this
evening, I thought I might just as well do as he said. And of
course I was very excited over this treasure hunt. I wanted to
see what it was all about. But then,’ she looked out to sea,
‘there was you. And this afternoon, after what happened, I
had decided to tell Largo I would not go. I would stay here
and see where you went and go with you.’ For the first time
she looked him full in the face and held his eyes. ‘Would you
have let me do that?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond reached out and put his hand against her cheek. ‘Of
course I would.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But what happens now? When shall I see you again?’</p>

<p class="pindent">This was the question Bond had dreaded. By sending her
back on board, and with the Geiger counter, he was putting
her in double danger. She could be found out by Largo, in
which case her death would be immediate. If it came to a chase,
which seemed almost certain, the <span class="it">Manta</span> would sink the <span class="it">Disco</span>
by gunfire or torpedo, probably without warning. Bond had
added up these factors and had closed his mind to them. He
kept it closed. He said, ‘As soon as this is over. I shall look for
you wherever you are. But now you are going to be in danger.
You know this. Do you want to go on with it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked at her watch. She said, ‘It is half past four. I must
go. Do not come with me to the car. Kiss me once and stay
here. Do not worry about what you want done. I will do it well.
It is either that or a stiletto in the back for this man.’ She held
out her arms. ‘Come.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Minutes later Bond heard the engine of the <span class="s">MG</span> come to life.
He waited until the sound had receded in the distance down
the Western Coast Road, then he went to the Land Rover and
climbed in and followed.</p>

<p class="pindent">A mile down the coast, at the two white obelisks that marked
the entrance to Palmyra, dust still hung in the driveway. Bond
sneered at his impulse to drive in after her and stop her from
going out to the yacht. What in hell was he thinking of? He
drove on fast down the road to Old Fort Point, where the
police watchers were housed in the garage of a deserted villa.
They were there, one man reading a paperback in a canvas
chair while the other sat before tripod binoculars that were
trained on the <span class="it">Disco</span> through a gap in the blinds of a side
window. The khaki walkie-talkie set was beside them on the
floor. Bond gave them the new briefing and got on the radio
to the Police Commissioner and confirmed it to him. The
Commissioner passed two messages to him from Leiter. One
was to the effect that the visit to Palmyra had been negative
except that a servant had said the girl’s baggage had gone on
board the <span class="it">Disco</span> that afternoon. The boathouse was completely
innocent. It contained a glass-bottomed boat and a pedallo.
The pedallo would have made the tracks they had seen from the
air. The second message said that the <span class="it">Manta</span> was expected in
twenty minutes. Would Bond meet Leiter at the Prince George
Wharf, where she would dock.</p>

<p class="line10">★</p>

<p class="pindent">The <span class="it">Manta</span>, coming with infinite caution up-channel, had
none of the greyhound elegance of the conventional submarine.
She was blunt and thick and ugly. The bulbous metal cucumber,
her rounded nose shrouded with tarpaulin to hide the
secrets of her radar scanner from the Nassavians, held no
suggestion of her speed, which Leiter said was around forty
knots submerged. ‘But they won’t tell you that, James. That’s
Classified. I guess we’re going to find that even the paper in the
can is Classified when we go aboard. Watch out for these Navy
guys. Nowadays they’re so tight-lipped they think even a
belch is a security risk.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What else do you know about her?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, we won’t tell this to the captain, but of course in
<span class="s">CIA</span> we had to be taught the basic things about these atom
subs, so as we could brief agents on what to look for and
recognize clues in their reports. She’s one of the George
Washington Class, about 4,000 tons, crew of around a hundred,
cost about a hundred million dollars. Range, anything you
want until the chow runs out or until the nuclear reactor needs
topping up—say every 100,000 miles or so. If she has the
same armament as the George Washington, she’ll have sixteen
vertical launching tubes, two banks of eight, for the Polaris
solid fuel missile. These have a range of around 1,200 miles.
The crews call the tubes “the Sherwood Forest” because
they’re painted green and the missile compartment looks like
rows of great big tree trunks. These Polaris jobs are fired from
way down below the surface. The sub stops and holds dead
steady. They have the ship’s exact position at all times through
radio fixes and star sights through a tricky affair called a star-tracker
periscope. All this dope is fed into the missiles automatically.
Then the chief gunner presses a button and a
missile shoots up through the water by compressed air. When
it breaks surface the solid fuel rockets ignite and take the missile
the rest of the way. Hell of a weapon really when you come to
think of it. Imagine these damned things shooting up out of the
sea anywhere in the world and blowing some capital city to
smithereens. We’ve got six of them already and we’re going to
have more. Good deterrent when you come to think of it. You
don’t know where they are or when. Not like bomber bases and
firing pads and so on you can track down and put out of action
with your first rocket wave.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond commented drily, ‘They’ll find some way of spotting
them. And presumably an atomic depth charge set deep would
send a shock-wave through hundreds of miles of water and
blow anything to pieces over a huge area. But has she got
anything smaller than these missiles? If we’re going to do a
job on the <span class="it">Disco</span> what are we going to use?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘She’s got six torpedo tubes up front and I dare say she’s got
some smaller stuff—machine-guns and so forth. The trouble’s
going to be to get the commander to fire them. He’s not going
to like firing on an unarmed civilian yacht on the orders of a
couple of plain-clothes guys, and one of them a Limey at that.
Hope his orders from the Navy Department are as solid as
mine and yours.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The huge submarine bumped gently against the wharf. Lines
were thrown and an aluminium gangplank was run ashore.
There was a ragged cheer from the crowd of watchers being
held back by a cordon of police. Leiter said, ‘Well, here we go.
And to one hell of a bad start. Not a hat between us to salute
the quarter deck with. You curtsy, I’ll bow.’</p>
