<h3 class="calibre10"><span class="it1">Violet-scented Breath</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">B</span>lofeld</span> <span class="lead-in">completed</span> his inspection of the faces. As he
had anticipated, only one pair of eyes had slid away from
his. He had known he was right. The double-checked reports
had been entirely circumstantial, but his own eyes and his
intuition had to be the seal. He slowly put both hands under
the table. One hand remained flat on his thigh. The other went
to a side-pocket and drew out a thin gold vinaigrette and placed
it on the table in front of him. He prised open the lid with his
thumbnail, took out a violet-scented cachou, and slipped it
into his mouth. It was his custom, when unpleasant things had
to be said, to sweeten his breath.</p>

<p class="pindent">Blofeld tucked the cachou under his tongue and began to
talk in a soft, resonant, and very beautifully modulated
voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I have a report to make to members about the Big Affair,
about Plan Omega.’ (Blofeld never prefixed his words with
‘Gentlemen’, ‘Friends’, ‘Colleagues’, or the like. These were
fripperies.) ‘But before I proceed to that matter, for security’s
sake I propose to touch upon another topic.’ Blofeld looked
mildly round the table. The same pair of eyes evaded his. He
continued in a narrative tone of voice: ‘The Executive will
agree that the first three years of our experience have been
successful. Thanks in part to our German section, the recovery
of Himmler’s jewels from the Mondsee was successfully
accomplished in total secrecy and the stones disposed of, by our
Turkish section, in Beirut. Income: £750,000. The disappearance
of the safe with its contents intact from the <span class="s">MWD</span>
headquarters in East Berlin has never been traced to our
Russian section, and the subsequent sale to the American
Central Intelligence Agency yielded 500,000 dollars. The
interception of one thousand ounces of heroin in Naples, the
property of the Pastori circuit, when sold to the Firpone
interests in Los Angeles, brought in 800,000 dollars. The
British Secret Service paid £100,000 for the Czech germ
warfare phials from the State chemical factory in Pilsen. The
successful blackmail of former <span class="s">SS</span> Gruppenführer Sonntag,
living under the name of Santos in Havana, yielded a meagre
100,000 dollars—unfortunately all the man possessed—and
the assassination of Peringue, the French heavy-water specialist
who went over to the Communists through Berlin, added,
thanks to the importance of his knowledge and the fact that we
got him before he had talked, one billion francs from the
Deuxième Bureau. In round sums, as the Special Executive
knows from our accounts, the total income to date, not counting
our last and undistributed dividend, has amounted to
approximately one and a half million pounds sterling in the
Swiss francs and Venezuelan bolivars in which for reasons of
prudence—they continue to be the hardest currencies in the
world—we convert all our takings. This income, as the Special
Executive will be aware, has been distributed in accordance
with our charter as to ten per cent for overheads and working
capital, ten per cent to myself, and the remainder in equal
shares of four per cent to the members—a profit to each
member of approximately £60,000. This amount I regard as a
barely adequate remuneration for members’ services—£20,000
a year is not in accordance with our expectations—but you will
be aware that Plan Omega will yield sufficient to provide each
of us with a considerable fortune and will allow us, if we wish
to do so, to wind up our organization and transfer our respective
energies to other pursuits.’ Blofeld looked down the table. He
said amiably, ‘Any questions?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The twenty pairs of eyes, on this occasion all of them,
gazed stolidly, unemotionally back at their chairman. Each
man had made his own calculation, knew his own mind. There
was no comment to be extracted from these good, though
narrow, minds. They were satisfied, but it was not a part of
their harsh personalities to say so. These were known things
that their chairman had spoken. It was time for the unknown.</p>

<p class="pindent">Blofeld slipped a second cachou into his mouth, manoeuvred
it under his tongue, and continued.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Then so be it. And now to the last operation, completed a
month ago and yielding one million dollars.’ Blofeld’s eyes
moved down the left-hand rank of members to the end of the
row. He said softly, ‘Stand up No 7.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Marius Domingue of the Union Corse, a proud, chunky man
with slow eyes, who was wearing ready-made, rather sharp
clothes that probably came from the Galleries Barbes in Marseilles,
got slowly to his feet. He looked squarely down the table
at Blofeld. His big, rough hands hung relaxed at the seam of his
trousers. Blofeld appeared to answer his gaze, but in fact he was
noting the reaction of the Corsican next to No 7, No 12, Pierre
Borraud. This man sat directly facing Blofeld at the far end of
the long table. It was his eyes that had been evasive during the
meeting. Now they were not. Now they were relaxed, assured.
Whatever the eyes had feared had passed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Blofeld addressed the company. ‘The operation, you will recall,
involved the kidnapping of the seventeen-year-old
daughter of Magnus Blomberg, owner of the Principality Hotel
in Las Vegas and participant in other American enterprises
through his membership of the Detroit Purple Gang. The girl
was abducted from her father’s suite in the Hotel de Paris in
Monte Carlo and taken by sea to Corsica. This part of the
operation was executed by the Corsican section. One million
dollars ransom was demanded. Mr Blomberg was willing and,
in accordance with the instructions of <span class="g">SPECTRE</span>, the money,
in an inflated life raft, was dropped at dusk off the Italian coast
near San Remo. At nightfall the raft was recovered by the ship
operated by our Sicilian section. This section is to be commended
for detecting the transistorized radio transmitter concealed
in the raft which it was intended should allow a unit of
the French Navy to direction-find our ship and hunt it down.
On receipt of the ransom money, and in accordance with our
undertaking, the girl was returned to her parents apparently
suffering from no ill effects except for the hair-dye that had
been necessary to transfer her from Corsica to a wagon-lit in
the Blue Train from Marseilles. I say “apparently”. From a
source in the police commissariat at Nice, I now learn that the
girl was violated during her captivity in Corsica.’ Blofeld
paused to allow this intelligence time to sink in. He continued.
‘It is the parents who maintain that she was violated. It is
possible that only carnal knowledge, with her consent, was
involved. No matter. This organization undertook that the girl
would be returned undamaged. Without splitting hairs about
the effect of sexual knowledge on a girl, I am of the opinion
that, whether the act was voluntary or involuntary on the girl’s
part, she was returned to her parents in a damaged, or at least
used, condition.’ Blofeld rarely employed gestures. Now he
slowly opened the left hand that lay on the table. He said, in
the same even tone of voice, ‘We are a large and very powerful
organization. I am not concerned with morals or ethics, but
members will be aware that I desire, and most strongly recommend,
that <span class="g">SPECTRE</span> shall conduct itself in a superior fashion.
There is no discipline in <span class="g">SPECTRE</span> except self-discipline. We
are a dedicated fraternity whose strength lies entirely in the
strength of each member. Weakness in one member is the
death-watch beetle in the total structure. You are aware of my
views in this matter, and on the occasions when cleansing has
been necessary you have approved my action. In this case, I
have already done what I considered necessary vis-à-vis this
girl’s family. I have returned half a million dollars with an
appropriate note of apology. This despite the matter of the
radio transmitter which was a breach of our contract with
the family. I dare say they knew nothing of the ruse. It was
typical police behaviour—a pattern that I was expecting. The
dividend for all of us from this operation will be correspondingly
reduced. Regarding the culprit. I have satisfied
myself that he is guilty. I have decided on the appropriate
action.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Blofeld looked down the table. His eyes were fixed on the
man standing—on No 7. The Corsican, Marius Domingue,
looked back at him steadily. He knew he was innocent. He
knew who was guilty. His body was still with tension. But it
was not fear. He had faith, as they all had, in the rightness of
Blofeld. He could not understand why he had been singled
out as a target for all the eyes that were now upon him, but
Blofeld had decided, and Blofeld was always right.</p>

<p class="pindent">Blofeld noted the man’s courage and sensed the reasons for it.
He also observed the sweat shining on the face of No 12, the
man alone at the head of the table. Good! The sweat would
improve the contact.</p>

<p class="pindent">Under the table, Blofeld’s right hand came up off his thigh,
found the knob, and pulled the switch.</p>

<p class="pindent">The body of Pierre Borraud, seized in the iron fist of 3,000
volts, arced in the armchair as if it had been kicked in the back.
The rough mat of black hair rose sharply straight up on his
head and remained upright, a gollywog fringe for the contorted,
bursting face. The eyes glared wildly and then faded. A
blackened tongue slowly protruded between the snarling teeth
and remained hideously extended. Thin wisps of smoke rose
from under the hands, from the middle of the back, and from
under the thighs where the concealed electrodes in the chair
had made contact. Blofeld pulled back the switch. The lights
in the room that had dimmed to orange, making a dull supernatural
glow, brightened to normal. The roasted meat and
burned fabric smell spread slowly. The body of No 12 crumpled
horribly. There was a sharp crack as the chin hit the edge
of the table. It was all over.</p>

<p class="pindent">Blofeld’s soft, even voice broke the silence. He looked down
the table at No 7. He noted that the staunch, impassive stance
had not quavered. This was a good man with good nerves.
Blofeld said, ‘Sit down No 7. I am satisfied with your conduct.’
(Satisfaction was Blofeld’s highest expression of praise.) ‘It was
necessary to distract the attention of No 12. He knew that he
was under suspicion. There might have been an untidy scene.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Some of the men round the table nodded their understanding.
As usual, Blofeld’s reasoning made good sense. No one was
greatly perturbed or surprised by what they had witnessed.
Blofeld always exercised his authority, meted out justice, in full
view of the members. There had been two previous occasions of
this nature, both at similar meetings and both on security or
disciplinary grounds which affected the cohesion, the inner
strength, of the whole team. In one, the offender had been shot
by Blofeld through the heart with a thick needle fired from a
compressed air pistol—no mean feat at around twelve paces. In
the other, the guilty man, who had been seated next to Blofeld
on his left hand, had been garrotted with a wire noose casually
flicked over his head and then, with two swift steps by Blofeld,
pulled tight over the back of the man’s chair. Those two deaths
had been just, necessary. So had this death, the third. Now, the
members, ignoring the heap of death at the end of the table,
settled in their chairs. It was time to get back to business.</p>

<p class="pindent">Blofeld snapped shut the gold vinaigrette and slipped it into a
waistcoat pocket. ‘The Corsican section,’ he said softly, ‘will
put forward recommendations for a replacement for No 12.
But that can wait until after completion of Plan Omega. On this
matter, there are certain details to be discussed. Sub-operator
G, recruited by the German section, has made an error, a
serious error which radically affects our time-table. This man,
whose membership of the Red Lightning Tong in Macao
should have made him expert in conspiracy, was instructed to
make his headquarters at a certain clinic in the south of
England, an admirable refuge for his purposes. His instructions
were to keep intermittent contact with the airman Petacchi at
the not-far-distant Boscombe Down airfield where the bomber
squadron is under training. He was to report at intervals on the
airman’s fitness and morale. His reports have been satisfactory,
and the airman, by the way, continues to be willing. But Sub-operator
G was also required to post The Letter on D plus
One, or three days from now. Unfortunately this foolish man
took it upon himself to become embroiled in a hotheaded
fashion with some fellow patient, at the clinic, as a result of
which, and I need not go into details, he is now in Brighton
Central Hospital suffering from second-degree burns. He is
thus out of action for at least a week. This will involve an
irritating but fortunately not a serious delay in Plan Omega.
Fresh instructions have been issued. The airman Petacchi has
been provided with a phial of influenza virus of sufficient
strength for him to remain on the sick list for one week during
which he will be unable to accept his test flight. He will take
the first flight after his recovery and alert us accordingly. The
date of his flight will be communicated to Sub-operator G and
he will by that time be recovered and will post The Letter
according to plan. The Special Executive,’ Blofeld glanced
round the table, ‘will readjust their flight schedules to Area
Zeta in accordance with the new operational schedule. As for
Sub-operator G’—Blofeld bent his gaze, one by one, on the
three ex-Gestapo men—‘this is an unreliable agent. The
German section will make arrangements for his elimination
within twenty-four hours of the posting of The Letter. Is that
understood?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The three German faces stood unanimously to attention,
‘Yes, sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘For the rest,’ continued Blofeld, ‘all is in order. No 1 has
solidly established his cover in Area Zeta. The treasure-hunting
myth continues to be built up and has already gained full
credence. The crew of the yacht, all hand-picked sub-operators,
are accepting the discipline and the security regulations better
than had been expected. A suitable land base has been secured.
It is remote and not easily accessible. It belongs to an eccentric
Englishman, the nature of whose friends and personal habits
demands seclusion. Your arrival in Area Zeta continues to be
minutely planned. Your wardrobe awaits you in Areas F and D,
according to your various flight plans. This wardrobe, down to
the smallest detail, will be in accordance with your identities as
financial backers of the treasure hunt who have demanded to
visit the scene and take part in the adventure. You are not
gullible millionaires. You are the kind of rich, middle-class
rentiers and businessmen who might be expected to be taken in
by such a scheme. You are all shrewd, so you have come to
watch over your investment and ensure that not one doubloon
goes astray.’ (Nobody smiled.) ‘You are all aware of the part
you have to play and I trust that you have studied your
respective roles with close attention.’</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a careful nodding of heads round the table. These
men were all satisfied that not too much had been asked of
them in the matter of their cover. This one was a rich café proprietor
from Marseilles. (He had been one. He could talk to anyone
about the business.) That one had vineyards in Yugoslavia.
(He had been brought up in Bled. He could talk vintages
and crop-sprays with a Calvet from Bordeaux.) That one
had smuggled cigarettes from Tangier. (He had done so and
would be just sufficiently discreet about it.) All of them had
been given covers that would stand up at least to second-degree
inspection.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘In the matter of aqualung training,’ continued Blofeld, ‘I
would like reports from each section.’ Blofeld looked at the
Yugoslav section of his left.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Satisfactory.’ ‘Satisfactory,’ echoed the German section, and
the word was repeated round the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">Blofeld commented, ‘The safety factor is paramount in all
underwater operations. Has this factor received sufficient attention
in your respective training schedules?’ Affirmative. ‘And
exercises with the new CO2 underwater gun?’ Again all
sections reported favourably. ‘And now,’ continued Blofeld, ‘I
would like a report from the Sicilian section on the preparations
for the bullion drop.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Fidelio Sciacca was a gaunt, cadaverous Sicilian with a
closed face. He might have been, and had been, a schoolmaster
with communist leanings. He spoke for the section because his
English, the compulsory language of the Special Executive, was
the best. He said, in a careful, expository tone of voice, ‘The
chosen area has been carefully reconnoitred. It is satisfactory.
I have here,’ he touched the briefcase on his lap, ‘the plans and
detailed time-table for the information of the Chairman and
members. Briefly, the designated area, Area T, is on the north-west
slopes of Mount Etna, above the tree line—that is to say
between the altitudes of 2,000 and 3,000 meters. This is an
uninhabited and uncultivated area of black lava on the upper
slopes of the volcano more or less above the small town of
Bronte. For the purpose of the drop, an area approximately
two kilometres square will be marked out by the torches of
the recovery team. In the centre of this area will be positioned
a Decca Aircraft Homing Signal as an additional navigational
aid. The bullion flight, which I estimate conservatively will
consist of five Mark IV Transport Comets, should make their
run in at ten thousand feet at an air-speed of 300 mph. Having
regard to the weight of each consignment, multiple parachutes
will be needed, and, owing to the harsh nature of the terrain,
very careful packing in foam rubber will be essential. The
parachutes and the packings should be coated in Dayglo or
some phosphorescent paint to assist recovery. No doubt,’ the
man opened his hands, ‘the <span class="g">SPECTRE</span> memorandum of dropping
instructions will include these and other details, but very
careful planning and co-ordination by those responsible for
the flight will be necessary.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And the recovery team?’ Blofeld’s voice probed softly but
with an urgent edge to it.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The Capo Mafiosi of the district is my uncle. He has eight
grandchildren, to whom he is devoted. I have made it clear that
the whereabouts of these children is known to my associates.
The man understood. At the same time, as instructed, I made
him the offer of one million pounds for total recovery and safe
delivery to the depot at Catania. This is a most important sum
for the funds of the Unione. The Capo Mafiosi agreed to these
terms. He understands that the robbery of a bank is in question.
He wishes to know no more. The delay that has been announced
will not affect the arrangements. It will still be within the full
moon period. Sub-operator 52 is a most capable man. He has
been provided with the Hallicrafters set issued to me for the
purpose and he will listen on 18 megacycles in accordance with
the schedule. Meanwhile he remains in touch with the Capo
Mafiosi, to whom he is related by marriage.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Blofeld was silent for a long two minutes. He slowly nodded.
‘I am satisfied. So far as the next step is concerned, the disposal
of the bullion, this will be in the hands of Sub-operator 201, of
whom we have had full experience. He is a man to be trusted.
The <span class="s">MV</span> <span class="it">Mercurial</span> will load at Catania and proceed through
the Suez Canal to Goa, in Portuguese India. En route, at a
designated cross-bearing in the Arabian Gulf, she will rendezvous
with a merchant ship owned by a consortium of the chief
Bombay bullion brokers. The bullion will be transferred to
this ship in exchange for the equivalent value, at the ruling gold
bullion price, in used Swiss francs, dollars, and bolivars. These
large amounts of currency will be broken up into the allotted
percentages and will then be transferred from Goa by chartered
plane to twenty-two different Swiss banks in Zurich, where
they will be placed in deposit boxes. The keys to these numbered
boxes will be distributed to members after this meeting.
From that moment on, and subject of course to the usual
security regulations regarding injudicious spending and display,
these deposits will be entirely at the disposal of members.’
Blofeld’s slow calm eyes surveyed the meeting. ‘Is this
procedure considered satisfactory?’</p>

<p class="pindent">There were cautious nods. No 18, Kandinsky, the Polish electronics
expert, spoke up. He spoke without diffidence. There
was no diffidence between these men. ‘This is not my province,’
he said seriously. ‘But is there not danger that one of the navies
concerned will intercept this ship, the <span class="it">Mercurial</span>, and remove
the bullion? It will be clear to the Western powers that the
bullion will have to be removed from Sicily. Various patrols of
the air and sea would be an easy matter.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You forget,’ Blofeld’s voice was patient, ‘that neither the
first, nor if need be the second, bomb will be rendered safe until
the money is in the Swiss banks. There will be no risk on that
score. Nor, another possibility that I had envisaged, is there
likely to be danger of our ship being pirated on the high seas
by some independent operator. I envisage that complete
secrecy will be enforced by the Western powers. Any leakage
would result in panic. Any other questions?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bruno Bayer, one of the German Section, said stiffly, ‘It is
fully understood that No 1 will be in immediate control in
Area Zeta. Is it correct that he will have full powers delegated
by yourself? Is it that he will, so to speak, be Supreme
Commander in the field?’</p>

<p class="pindent">How typical, thought Blofeld. The Germans will always
obey orders, but they wish to be quite clear where final authority
resides. The German generals would only obey the Supreme
Command if they knew Hitler approved the Supreme Command.
He said firmly, ‘I have made it clear to the Special
Executive, and I repeat: No 1 is already, by your unanimous
vote, my successor in case of my death or incapacity. So far as
Plan Omega is concerned, he is deputy Supreme Commander of
<span class="g">SPECTRE</span>, and since I shall remain at Headquarters to keep
watch over reactions to The Letter, No 1 will be Supreme
Commander in the field. His orders will be obeyed as if they
were my own. I hope we are fully agreed in this matter.’
Blofeld’s eyes sharply, focused, swept the meeting. Everyone
signified his agreement.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So,’ said Blofeld. ‘Then the meeting is now closed. I will
instruct the disposal squad to take care of the remains of No 12.
No 18, please connect me with No 1 on 20 megacycles. That
waveband will have been unoccupied by the French Post Office
since eight o’clock.’</p>
