<h3 class="calibre10"><span class="it1">Time for Decision</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he</span> <span class="lead-in">interior</span> of the submarine was incredibly roomy, and
it was stairs and not a ladder that led down into the interior.
There was no clutter, and the sparkling paintwork was in
two-tone green. Powerlines painted in vivid colours provided a
cheerful contrast to the almost hospital décor. Preceded by the
officer of the watch, a young man of about twenty-eight,
they went down two decks. The air (70° with 46% humidity,
explained the officer) was beautifully cool. At the bottom of the
stairs he turned left and knocked on a door that said ‘Commander
P. Pedersen, <span class="s">USN</span>.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The captain looked about forty. He had a square, rather
Scandinavian face with a black crew-cut just going grey. He
had shrewd, humorous eyes but a dangerous mouth and jaw.
He was sitting behind a neatly stacked metal desk smoking a
pipe. There was an empty coffee cup in front of him and a
signal pad on which he had just been writing. He got up
and shook hands, waved them to two chairs in front of
his desk and said to the officer of the watch, ‘Coffee,
please, Stanton, and have this sent, would you?’ He tore
the top sheet off the signal pad and handed it across. ‘Most
Immediate.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He sat down. ‘Well gentlemen. Welcome aboard. Commander
Bond, it’s a pleasure to have a member of the Royal
Navy visit the ship. Ever been in subs before?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I have,’ said Bond, ‘but only as a supercargo. I was in
intelligence—<span class="s">RNVR</span> Special Branch. Strictly a chocolate
sailor.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The captain laughed. ‘That’s good! And you, Mr Leiter?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No, Captain. But I used to have one of my own. You
operated it with a sort of rubber bulb and tube. Trouble was
they’d never let me have enough depth of water in the bath
to see what she could really do.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sounds rather like the Navy Department. They’ll never let
me try this ship full out. Except once on trials. Every time you
want to get going, the needle comes across a damn red line
some interfering so-and-so has painted on the dial. Well,
gentlemen,’ the captain looked at Leiter, ‘what’s the score?
Haven’t had such a flood of Top Secret Most Immediates since
Korea. I don’t mind telling you, the last one was from the
Chief of the Navy, Personal. Said I was to consider myself
under your orders, or, on your death or incapacity, under
Commander Bond’s, until Admiral Carlson arrives at 1900 this
evening. So what? What’s cooking? All I know is that all
signals have been prefixed Operation Thunderball. What is
this operation?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had greatly taken to Commander Pedersen. He liked
his ease and humour and, in general—the old navy phrase
came back to him—the cut of his jib. Now he watched the
stolid good-humoured face as Leiter told his story down to the
departure of Largo’s amphibian at 1.30 and the instructions
Bond had given to Domino Vitali.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the background to Leiter’s voice there was a medley of
soft noises—the high, constant whine of a generator overlaid
by the muted background of canned music—the Ink Spots
singing ‘I love coffee, I love tea’. Occasionally the PA System
above the captain’s desk crackled and sang with operational
double-talk—‘Roberts to Chief of the Boat’—‘Chief Engineer
wants Oppenshaw’—‘Team Blue to Compartment F’—and
from somewhere came the suck and gurgle of a pumplike
apparatus that sounded punctually every two minutes. It was
like being inside the simple brain of a robot that worked by
hydraulics and electrical impulses with a few promptings from
its human masters.</p>

<p class="pindent">After ten minutes, Commander Pedersen sat back. He
reached for his pipe and began filling it absentmindedly. He
said, ‘Well, that’s one hell of a story.’ He smiled. ‘And strangely
enough, even if I hadn’t had these signals from the Navy
Department, I’d believe it. Always did think something like
this would happen one of these days. Hell! I have to carry
these missiles around, and I’m in command of a nuclear ship.
But that doesn’t mean that I’m not terrified by the whole
business. Got a wife and two children, and that doesn’t help
either. These atomic weapons are just too damned dangerous.
Why, any one of these little sandy cays around here could hold
the whole of the United States to ransom—just with one of my
missiles trained on Miami. And here am I, fellow called Peter
Pedersen, age thirty-eight, maybe sane or maybe not, toting
around sixteen of the things—enough to damn near wipe out
England. However,’ he put his hands down on the desk in front
of him, ‘that’s all by the way. Now we’ve got just one small
piece of the problem on our hands—small, but as big as the
world. So what are we to do? As I see it, the idea of you
gentlemen is that this man Largo will be coming back any
minute now in his plane after picking up the bombs from
where he hid them. If he’s got the bombs, and on what you’ve
told me I’ll go along with the probability that he has, this girl
will give us the tip-off. Then we close in and arrest his ship or
blow it out of the water. Right? But supposing he hasn’t got
the bombs on board, or for one reason or another we don’t
get the tip-off, what do we do then?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said quietly, ‘We follow him, sit close on his tail, until
the time limit, that’s about twenty-four hours from now, is up.
That’s all we can do without causing one hell of a legal stink.
When the time limit’s up, we can hand the whole problem back
to our governments and they can decide what to do with the
<span class="it">Disco</span> and the sunken plane and all the rest. By that time, some
little man in a speedboat we’ve never heard of may have left one
of the bombs off the coast of America, and Miami may have
gone up in the air. Or there may be a big bang somewhere else
in the world. There’s been plenty of time to take those bombs
off the plane and get them thousands of miles from here. Well,
that’ll be too bad and we’ll have muffed it. But at this moment
we’re in the position of a detective watching a man he thinks
is going to commit a murder. Doesn’t even know for sure
whether he’s got a gun on him or not. There’s nothing the
detective can do but follow the man and wait until he actually
pulls the gun out of his pocket and points it. Then, and only
then, the detective can shoot the man or arrest him.’ Bond
turned to Leiter. ‘Isn’t that about it, Felix?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s how it figures. And Captain, Commander Bond here
and I are damn sure Largo’s our man and that he’ll be sailing
for his target in no time at all. That’s why we agreed to panic
and ask you along. One gets you a hundred he’ll be placing
that bomb at night and tonight’s the last night he’s got. By the
way, Captain, have you got steam up, or whatever the atom
boys call it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I have, and we can be under way in just about five minutes.’
The captain shook his head. ‘But there’s one bit of bad news
for you, gentlemen. I just can’t figure how we’re going to keep
track of the <span class="it">Disco</span>.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How’s that? You’ve got the speed, haven’t you?’ Leiter
caught himself pointing his steel hook threateningly at the
captain, and hastily brought it down again to his lap.</p>

<p class="pindent">The captain smiled. ‘Guess so. Guess we could give her a
good race on a straight course, but you gentlemen don’t seem
to have figured on the navigational hazards in this part of the
ocean.’ He pointed at the British Admiralty chart on the wall.
‘Take a look at that. Ever seen a chart with so many figures on
it? Looks like a spilled ants’ nest. Those are soundings,
gentlemen, and I can tell you that unless the <span class="it">Disco</span> sticks to
one of the deep-water channels—Tongue of the Ocean,
North-West Providence Channel, or the North-East—we’ve
had it, as Commander Bond would say. All the rest of that
area’—he waved a hand—‘may look the same blue colour
on a map, but after your trip in that Grumman Goose you
know darned well it isn’t the same blue colour. Darned near
the whole of that area is banks and shoal with only around
three to ten fathoms over it. If I was quite crazy and looking
for a nice cosy job ashore, I’d take the ship along surfaced in
ten fathoms—if I could bribe the navigator and seal off the
echo-sounder from crew members. But even if we got a long
spell of ten fathoms on the chart, you got to remember that’s
an old chart, dates back to the days of sail, and these banks
have been shifting for more than fifty years since it was drawn
up. Then there’s the tides that set directly on to and off
the banks, and the coral niggerheads that won’t show up on the
echo-sounder until you hear the echo of them smashing up the
hull or the screw.’ The captain turned back to his desk. ‘No,
gentlemen. This Italian vessel was darned well chosen. With
that hydrofoil device of hers, she probably doesn’t draw
more than a fathom. If she chooses to keep to the shallows,
we just haven’t got a chance. And that’s flat.’ The captain
looked from one to another of them. ‘Want me to call up the
Navy Department and have Fort Lauderdale take over with
those fighter bombers you’ve got on call—get them to do a
shadowing job?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The two men looked at each other. Bond said, ‘She won’t be
showing lights. They’ll have the hell of a job picking her up at
night. What do you say, Felix? Maybe we’d better call them
out even if it’s only to keep some sort of a watch off the American
coast. Then, if the Captain’s willing, we’ll take the North-West
Channel—if the <span class="it">Disco</span> sails, that is—and bank on the
Bahamas Rocket Station being Target No 1.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Felix Leiter ran his left hand through the mop of straw-coloured
hair. ‘Goddammit,’ he said angrily. ‘Hell yes, I
suppose so. We’re looking fools enough already bringing the
<span class="it">Manta</span> on stage. What’s a squadron of planes? Sure. We’ve
just <span class="it">got</span> to back our hunch that it’s Largo and the <span class="it">Disco</span>. Come
on, let’s get together with the Captain and whip off a signal
that doesn’t look too damned silly—copy to <span class="s">CIA</span> and to your
Chief. How do you want it to go?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Admiralty for M, prefixed Operation Thunderball.’ Bond
wiped a hand down over his face. ‘God, this is going to put the
cat among the pigeons.’ He looked up at the big metal wall
clock. ‘Six. That’ll be midnight in London. Popular time to get
a signal like this.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The PA System in the ceiling spoke more clearly. ‘Watch
Officer to Captain. Police officer with urgent message for Commander
Bond.’ The captain pressed a switch and spoke into a
desk microphone. ‘Bring him below. Prepare to cast off lines.
All hands prepare for sailing.’ The captain waited for the
acknowledgement and released the switch. The captain smiled
across at them. He said to Bond, ‘What’s the name of that
girl? Domino? Well, Domino, say the good word.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The door opened. A police corporal, his hat off, crashed to
attention on the steel flooring and extended a stiff arm. Bond
took the buff <span class="s">OHMS</span> envelope and slit it open. He ran his eyes
down the pencilled message signed by the Police Commissioner.
Unemotionally he read out:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent"><span class="g">‘PLANE RETURNED 1730 HOISTED INBOARD. DISCO
SAILED AT 1755, FULL SPEED, COURSE NORTH WEST
STOP GIRL DID NOT REPEAT NOT REAPPEAR ON
DECK AFTER BOARDING.’</span></p>

</div>

<p class="pindent">Bond borrowed a signal blank from the captain and wrote:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent"><span class="g">MANTA WILL ENDEAVOUR SHADOW VIA NORTHWEST
PROVIDENCE CHANNEL STOP FIGHTER BOMBER
SQUADRON FROM FORT LAUDERDALE WILL BE
ASKED THROUGH NAVY DEPARTMENT TO COOPERATE
WITHIN RADIUS OF TWO HUNDRED MILES OFF
FLORIDA COAST STOP MANTA WILL KEEP CONTACT
THROUGH WINDSOR FIELD AIR CONTROL STOP NAVY
DEPARTMENT AND ADMIRALTY BEING INFORMED
STOP PLEASE INFORM GOVERNOR ALSO ADMIRAL
CARLSON AND BRIGADIER FAIRCHILD ON ARRIVAL.</span></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">Bond signed the message and passed it to the captain, who also
signed, as did Leiter. Bond put the message in an envelope and
gave it to the corporal, who wheeled smartly and clanked out
in his heavy boots.</p>

<p class="pindent">When the door was shut, the captain pressed down the
switch on the intercom. He gave orders to sail, surfaced,
course due north, at ten knots. Then he switched off. In the
short silence, there was a flurry of background noise, piping
of bosuns’ whistles, a thin mechanical whine, and the sound
of running feet. The submarine trembled slightly. The captain
said quietly, ‘Well, gentlemen, that’s that. I’d like to have the
goose a bit less wild and a bit more solid. But I’ll be glad to
chase her for you. Now then, that signal.’</p>

<p class="pindent">With only half his mind on the wording of the signal, Bond
sat and worried about the significance of the Commissioner’s
message and about Domino. It looked bad. It looked as if
either the plane had not brought back the two bombs, or one of
them, in which case the mobilization of the <span class="it">Manta</span> and of the
fighter bombers was a pretty meaningless precaution, hardly
justified by the evidence. It could easily be that the crashed
Vindicator and the missing bombs were the work of some
entirely different group and that, while they chased the <span class="it">Disco</span>,
the field was being left clear for <span class="g">SPECTRE</span>. But Bond’s instincts
refused to allow him to accept this possibility. As cover, the
whole <span class="it">Disco</span>-Largo set-up was one hundred per cent watertight.
It could not be faulted in any respect. That in itself was
enough to arouse Bond’s suspicions. A plot of this magnitude
and audacity could only have been conceived under faultless
cover and down to the smallest detail. Largo could have just
set off on his treasure hunt, and everything, down to the last-minute
plane recce of the treasure location, to see if there were
any fishing boats about for instance, fitted in with that possibility.
Or he could be sailing to lay the bomb, adjust the time
fuse for perhaps a few hours after the deadline to allow time
for its recovery or destruction if England and America at the
last moment agreed to pay the ransom, and get far enough
away from the danger area to avoid the explosion and establish
an alibi. But where was the bomb? Had it arrived on board
in the plane and had Domino for some reason been unable to
go up on deck to make her signal? Or was it going to be picked
up en route to the target area? The westerly course from
Nassau, heading perhaps for the North-West Light, through
the Berry Island Channel, fitted both possibilities. The
sunken plane lay westwards, south of the Biminis, and so did
Miami and other possible targets on the American coast. Or,
after passing through the channel, about fifty miles west of
Nassau, the <span class="it">Disco</span> could veer sharply northwards and, after
another fifty miles of sailing through shoal water that would
discourage pursuit, get back into the North-West Providence
Channel and make straight for the Grand Bahamas and the
missile station.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond, fretted with indecision and the fear that he and Leiter
were making majestic fools of themselves, forced himself to
face one certainty—he and Leiter and the <span class="it">Manta</span> were engaged
on a crazy gamble. If the bomb was on board, if the <span class="it">Disco</span>
veered north for the Grand Bahamas and the missile station
then, by racing up the North-West Channel, the <span class="it">Manta</span>
might intercept her in time.</p>

<p class="pindent">But if this gamble came off, with all its possibilities of error,
why hadn’t Domino made her signal? What had happened to
her?</p>
