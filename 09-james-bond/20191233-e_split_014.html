<h3 class="calibre10">‘<span class="it1">Fasten your lap-strap</span>’</h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">J</span>ames Bond</span> scraped the last dregs of yoghurt out of the
bottom of the carton that said ‘<span class="it">Goat-milk culture. From
our own Goat Farm at Stanway, Glos. The Heart of the Cotswolds.
According to an authentic Bulgarian recipe.</span>’ He took an
Energen roll, sliced it carefully—they are apt to crumble—and
reached for the black treacle. He masticated each mouthful
thoroughly. Saliva contains ptyalin. Thorough mastication
creates ptyalin which helps to convert starches into sugar to
supply energy for the body. Ptyalin is an enzyme. Other
enzymes are pepsin, found in the stomach, and trypsin and
erepsin found in the intestine. These and other enzymes are
chemical substances that break up the food as it passes through
the mouth, the stomach, and the digestive tract and help
absorb it directly into the blood-stream. James Bond now
had all these important facts at his finger-tips. He couldn’t
understand why no one had told him these things before. Since
leaving Shrublands ten days before, he had never felt so well
in his life. His energy had doubled. Even the paper-work he
had always found an intolerable drudgery was now almost a
pleasure. He ate it up. Sections, after a period of being only surprised,
were now becoming slightly irritated by the forceful,
clear-headed minutes that came shooting back at them from the
Double-O Section. Bond awoke so early and so full of beans
that he had taken to arriving at his office early and leaving late,
much to the irritation of his secretary, the delectable Loelia
Ponsonby, who found her own private routines being put
seriously out of joint. She was also beginning to show signs of
irritation and strain. She had even taken upon herself to have a
private word with Miss Moneypenny, M’s secretary and her
best friend in the building. Miss Moneypenny, swallowing her
jealousy of Loelia Ponsonby, had been encouraging. ‘It’s all
right, Lil,’ she had said over coffee in the canteen. ‘The Old
Man was like that for a couple of weeks after he had got back
from that damned nature cure place. It was like working for
Gandhi or Schweitzer or someone. Then a couple of bad cases
came up and rattled him and one evening he went to Blades—to
take his mind off things I suppose—and the next day he
felt awful, and looked it, and from then on he’s been all right
again. I suppose he got back on the champagne cure or something.
It’s really the best for men. It makes them awful, but at
least they’re human like that. It’s when they get godlike one
can’t stand them.’</p>

<p class="pindent">May, Bond’s elderly Scottish treasure, came in to clear the
breakfast things away. Bond had lit up a Duke of Durham,
king-size, with filter. The authoritative Consumers Union of
America rates this cigarette the one with the smallest tar and
nicotine content. Bond had transferred to the brand from the
fragrant but powerful Morland Balkan mixture with three
gold rings round the paper he had been smoking since his
teens. The Dukes tasted of almost nothing, but they were at
least better than Vanguards, the new ‘tobaccoless’ cigarette
from America, that despite its health-protecting qualities,
filled the room with a faint ‘burning leaves’ smell that made
visitors to his office inquire whether ‘something was on fire
somewhere.’</p>

<p class="pindent">May was fiddling about with the breakfast things—her signal
that she had something to say. Bond looked up from the centre
news page of <span class="it">The Times</span>. ‘Anything on your mind, May?’</p>

<p class="pindent">May’s elderly, severe features were flushed. She said defensively,
‘I have that.’ She looked straight at Bond. She was holding
the yoghurt carton in her hand. She crumpled it in her
strong fingers and dropped it among the breakfast things on
the tray. ‘It’s not my place to say it, Mister James, but ye’re
poisoning yersel’.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said cheerfully. ‘I know, May. You’re quite right. But
at least I’ve got them down to ten a day.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m not talking about yer wee bitty smoke. I’m talking ’bout
this,’ May gestured at the tray, ‘this pap.’ The word was spat
out with disdain. Having got this off her chest May gathered
steam. ‘It’s no recht for a man to be eating bairns’ food and
slops and suchlike. Ye needn’t worry that I’ll talk, Mister
James, but I’m knowing more about yer life than mebbe ye
were wishing I did. There’s been times when they’ve brought
ye home from hospital and there’s talk you’ve been in a
motoring accident or some such. But I’m not the old fule ye
think I am, Mister James. Motoring accidents don’t make one
small hole in yer shoulder or yer leg or somewhere. Why,
ye’ve got scars on ye the noo—ach, ye needn’t grin like that,
I’ve seen them—that could only be made by bullets. And
these guns and knives and things ye carry around when ye’re
off abroad. Ach!’ May put her hands on her hips. Her eyes
were bright and defiant. ‘Ye can tell me to mind my ain business
and pack me off back to Glen Orchy, but before I go I’m
telling ye, Mister James, that if ye get yerself into anuither
fight and ye’ve got nothing but yon muck in yer stomach,
they’ll be bringing ye home in a hearse. That’s what they’ll
be doing.’</p>

<p class="pindent">In the old days, James Bond would have told May to go to
hell and leave him in peace. Now, with infinite patience and
good humour, he gave May a quick run through the basic
tenets of ‘live’ as against ‘dead’ foods. ‘You see, May,’ he said
reasonably, ‘all these denaturized foods—white flour, white
sugar, white rice, white salts, whites of egg—these are dead
foods. Either they’re dead anyway like whites of egg or they’ve
had all the nourishment refined out of them. They’re slow
poisons, like fried foods and cakes and coffee and heaven
knows how many of the things I used to eat. And anyway,
look how wonderfully well I am. I feel absolutely a new man
since I took to eating the right things and gave up drink and so
on. I sleep twice as well. I’ve got twice as much energy. No
headaches. No muscle pains. No hangovers. Why, a month
ago there wasn’t a week went by but that on at least one day
I couldn’t eat anything for breakfast but a couple of aspirins
and a prairie oyster. And you know quite well that that used
to make you cluck and tut-tut all over the place like an old hen.
Well,’ Bond raised his eyebrows amiably, ‘what about that?’</p>

<p class="pindent">May was defeated. She picked up the tray and, with a stiff
back, made for the door. She paused on the threshold and
turned round. Her eyes were bright with angry tears. ‘Well,
all I can say is, Mister James, that mebbe ye’re right and
mebbe ye’re wrong. What worries the life out of me is that
ye’re not yersel’ any more.’ She went out and banged the
door.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sighed and picked up the paper. He said the magical
words that all men say when a middle-aged woman makes a
temperamental scene, ‘change of life’, and went back to reading
about the latest reasons for not having a Summit meeting.</p>

<p class="pindent">The telephone, the red one that was the direct line with
Headquarters, gave its loud, distinctive jangle. Bond kept his
eyes on the page and reached out a hand. With the Cold War
easing off, it was not like the old days. This would be nothing
exciting. Probably cancelling his shoot at Bisley that afternoon
with the new <span class="s">FN</span> rifle. ‘Bond speaking.’</p>

<p class="pindent">It was the Chief of Staff. Bond dropped his paper on the floor.
He pressed the receiver to his ear, trying, as in the old days, to
read behind the words.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘At once please, James. M.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Something for me?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Something for everyone. Crash-dive, and Ultra Hush. If
you’ve got any dates for the next few weeks, better cancel them.
You’ll be off tonight. See you.’ The line went dead.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had the most selfish car in England. It was a Mark II
Continental Bentley that some rich idiot had married to a telegraph
pole on the Great West Road. Bond had bought the bits
for £1,500 and Rolls had straightened the bend in the chassis
and fitted new clockwork—the Mark IV engine with 9·5
compression. Then Bond had gone to Mulliners with £3,000,
which was half his total capital, and they had sawn off the old
cramped sports saloon body and had fitted a trim, rather square
convertible two-seater affair, power-operated, with only two
large armed bucket seats in black leather. The rest of the blunt
end was all knife-edged, rather ugly, boot. The car was painted
in rough, not gloss, battleship grey and the upholstery was
black morocco. She went like a bird and a bomb and Bond
loved her more than all the women at present in his life rolled,
if that were feasible, together.</p>

<p class="pindent">But Bond refused to be owned by any car. A car, however
splendid, was a means of locomotion (he called the Continental
‘The Locomotive’ . . . ‘I’ll pick you up in my locomotive’) and
it must at all times be ready to locomote—no garage doors to
break one’s nails on, no pampering with mechanics except for
the quick monthly service. The locomotive slept out of doors
in front of his flat and was required to start immediately, in all
weathers, and, after that, stay on the road.</p>

<p class="pindent">The twin exhausts—Bond had demanded two-inch pipes; he
hadn’t liked the old soft flutter of the marque—growled solidly
as the long grey nose topped by a big octagonal silver bolt
instead of the winged B, swerved out of the little Chelsea square
and into King’s Road. It was nine o’clock, too early for the bad
traffic, and Bond pushed the car fast up Sloane Street and into
the park. It would also be too early for the traffic police, so he
did some fancy driving that brought him to the Marble Arch
exit in three minutes flat. Then there came the slow round-the-houses
into Baker Street and so into Regent’s Park. Within ten
minutes of getting the Hurry call he was going up in the lift
of the big square building to the eighth and top floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">Already, as he strode down the carpeted corridor, he smelled
emergency. On this floor, besides M’s offices, was housed Communications,
and from behind the grey closed doors there came
a steady zing and crackle from the banks of transmitters and a
continuous machine-gun rattle and clack from the cipher
machines. It crossed Bond’s mind that a General Call was
going out. What the hell had happened?</p>

<p class="pindent">The Chief of Staff was standing over Miss Moneypenny. He
was handing her signals from a large sheaf and giving her
routing instructions. ‘<span class="g">CIA</span> Washington, Personal for Dulles.
Cipher Triple X by Teleprinter. Mathis. Deuxième Bureau.
Same prefix and route. Station F for Head of <span class="g">NATO</span> Intelligence.
Personal. Standard route through Head of Section. This
one by Safe Hand to Head of <span class="g">MI5</span>, Personal, copy to Commissioner
of Police, Personal, and these,’ he handed over a thick
batch, ‘Personal to Heads of Stations from M. Cipher Double
X by Whitehall Radio and Portishead. All right? Clear them as
quick as you can, there’s a good girl. There’ll be more coming.
We’re in for a bad day.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Miss Moneypenny smiled cheerfully. She liked what she
called the shot-and-shell days. It reminded her of when she
had started in the Service as a junior in the Cipher Department.
She leant over and pressed the switch on the intercom,
‘007’s here, sir.’ She looked up at Bond. ‘You’re off.’ The Chief
of Staff grinned and said, ‘Fasten your lap-strap.’ The red
light went on above M’s door. Bond walked through.</p>

<p class="pindent">Here it was entirely peaceful. M sat relaxed, sideways to his
desk, looking out of the broad window at the distant glittering
fretwork of London’s skyline. He glanced up. ‘Sit down, 007.
Have a look at these.’ He reached out and slid some foolscap-sized
photostats across the desk. ‘Take your time.’ He picked
up his pipe and began to fill it, absentminded fingers dipping
into the shell-base tobacco jar at his elbow.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond picked up the top photostat. It showed the front and
back of an addressed envelope, dusted for finger-prints, which
were all over its surface.</p>

<p class="pindent">M glanced sideways. ‘Smoke if you like.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, ‘Thanks, sir. I’m trying to give it up.’</p>

<p class="pindent">M said, ‘Humpf,’ put his pipe in his mouth, struck a match,
and inhaled a deep lungful of smoke. He settled himself deeper
in his chair. The grey sailor’s eyes gazed through the window
introspectively, seeing nothing.</p>

<p class="pindent">The envelope, prefixed ‘<span class="g">PERSONAL AND MOST IMMEDIATE</span>’,
was addressed to the Prime Minister, by name, at
No 10, Downing Street, Whitehall, London, <span class="g">SW1</span>. Every detail
of the address was correct down to the final ‘<span class="s">PC</span>’ to denote that
the Prime Minister was a Privy Councillor. The punctuation
was meticulous. The stamp was postmarked Brighton, 8.30
am on 3 June. It crossed Bond’s mind that the letter might
therefore have been posted under cover of night and that it
would probably have been delivered some time in the early
afternoon of the same day, yesterday. A typewriter with a
bold, rather elegant type had been used. This fact together
with the generous 5-by-7½-in. envelope and the spacing and
style of the address gave a solid, businesslike impression. The
back of the envelope showed nothing but finger-prints. There
was no sealing wax.</p>

<p class="pindent">The letter, equally correct and well laid-out, ran as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="noindent">Mr Prime Minister,</p>

<p class="pindent">You should be aware, or you will be if you communicate
with the Chief of the Air Staff, that, since approximately 10 pm
yesterday, 2 June, a British aircraft carrying two atomic weapons
is overdue on a training flight. The aircraft is Villiers Vindicator
<span class="g">O/NBR</span> from No 5 <span class="s">RAF</span> Experimental Squadron based at
Boscombe Down. The Ministry of Supply Identification
Numbers on the atomic weapons are <span class="s">MOS</span>/bd/654/Mk V. and
<span class="s">MOS</span>/bd/655/Mk V. There are also <span class="s">USAF</span> Identification
Numbers in such profusion and of such prolixity that I will
not weary you with them.</p>

<p class="pindent">This aircraft was on a <span class="g">NATO</span> training flight with a crew of
five and one observer. It carried sufficient fuel for ten hours’
flying at 600 mph at a mean altitude of 40,000 feet.</p>

<p class="pindent">This aircraft, together with the two atomic weapons, is now
in the possession of this organization. The crew and the observer
are deceased and you have our authority to inform the next-of-kin
accordingly, thus assisting you in preserving, on the grounds
that the aircraft has crashed, the degree of secrecy you will no
doubt wish to maintain and which will be equally agreeable to
ourselves.</p>

<p class="pindent">The whereabouts of this aircraft and of the two atomic
weapons, rendering them possible of recovery, will be communicated
to you in exchange for the equivalent of £100,000,000
in gold bullion, one thousand, or not less than nine hundred
and ninety-nine, fine. Instructions for the delivery of the gold
are contained in the attached memorandum. A further condition
is that the recovery and disposal of the gold will not be hampered
and that a free pardon, under your personal signature and that
of the President of the United States, will be issued in the name
of this organization and all its members.</p>

<p class="pindent">Failure to accept these conditions within seven days from
5 pm <span class="s">GMT</span> on 3 June 1959—i.e. not later than 5 pm <span class="s">GMT</span> on
10 June, 1959—will have the following consequences. Immediately
after that date a piece of property belonging to the
Western Powers, valued at not less than the aforesaid
£100,000,000, will be destroyed. There will be loss of life. If,
within 48 hours after this warning, willingness to accept our
terms is still not communicated, there will ensue, without
further warning, the destruction of a major city situated in an
undesignated country of the world. There will be very great
loss of life. Moreover, between the two occurrences, this
organization will reserve to itself the right to communicate to
the world the 48-hour time limit. This measure, which will
cause widespread panic in every major city, will be designed to
hasten your hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">This, Mr Prime Minister, is a single and final communication.
We shall await your reply, every hour on the hour <span class="s">GMT</span>, on
the 16-megacycle waveband.</p>


          <div class="literal-container-right">

<p class="pindent">James Bond read through the letter again and put it carefully
down on the desk in front of him. He then turned to the second
page, a detailed memorandum for the delivery of the gold.
‘North-western slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily . . . Decca
Navigational Aid transmitting on . . . Full moon period . . .
between midnight and 0100 <span class="s">GMT</span> . . . individual quarter-ton
consignments packed in one-foot-thick foam rubber . . .
minimum of three parachutes per consignment . . . nature of
planes and flight schedule to be communicated on the 16-megacycle
waveband not later than 24 hours before the operation
. . . Any counter measures initiated will be considered a
breach of contract and will result in the detonation of Atomic
Weapon No 1 or No 2 as the case may be.’ The typed signature
was the same. Both pages had one last line: ‘Copy to the President
of the United States of America, by Registered Airmail,
posted simultaneously.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laid the photostat quietly down on top of the others. He
reached into his hip-pocket for the gunmetal cigarette case that
now contained only nine cigarettes, took one and lit it, drawing
the smoke deep down into his lungs and letting it out with a
long, reflective hiss.</p>

<p class="pindent">M swivelled his chair round so they were facing each other.
‘Well?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond noticed that M’s eyes, three weeks before so clear and
vital, were now bloodshot and strained. No wonder! He said:
‘If this plane, and the weapons, really are missing, I think it
stands up, sir. I think they mean it. I think it’s a true bill.’</p>

<p class="pindent">M said, ‘So does the War Cabinet. So do I.’ He paused. ‘Yes,
the plane with the bombs is missing. And the stock numbers on
the bombs are correct.’</p>
