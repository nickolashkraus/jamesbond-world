<h3 class="calibre10"><span class="it1">The ‘Disco Volante’</span></h3>

<p class="noindent"><span class="lead-in"><span class="dropcap">O</span>n</span> <span class="lead-in">board the yacht</span>, No 1 put down his night glasses,
took a Charvet handkerchief out of the breast pocket of
his white shark-skin jacket and dabbed gently at his forehead
and temples. The musky scent of Schiaparelli’s Snuff was
reassuring, reminding him of the easy side of life, of Dominetta
who would now be sitting down to dinner—everyone kept
Spanish hours in Nassau and cocktails would not have finished
before ten—with the raffish but rather gay Saumurs and their
equally frivolous guests; of the early game that would already
be under way at the Casino; of the calypsos thudding into the
night from the bars and night-clubs on Bay Street. He put the
handkerchief back in his pocket. But this also was good—this
wonderful operation! Like clockwork! He glanced at his watch.
Just ten fifteen. The plane had been a bare thirty minutes late,
a nasty half-hour to have to wait, but the landing had been
perfect. Vargas had done a good quick job on the Italian pilot—what
was his name?—so that now they were running only
fifteen minutes late. If the recovery group didn’t have to use
oxy-acetylene cutters to get out the bombs, they would soon
make that up. But one mustn’t expect no hitch at all. There
was a good eight hours of darkness to go. Calm, method,
efficiency, in that order. Calm, method, efficiency. No 1 ducked
down off the bridge and went into the radio cabin. It smelled
of sweat and tension. Anything from the Nassau control
tower? Any report of a low-flying plane? Of a possible crash
into the sea off Bimini? Then keep watching and get me No 2.
Quick, please. It’s just on the quarter.</p>

<p class="pindent">No 1 lit a cigarette and watched the yacht’s big brain get to
work, scanning the ether, listening, searching. The operator
played the dials with insect fingers, pausing, verifying, hastening
on through the sound waves of the world. Now he suddenly
stopped, checked, minutely adjusted the volume. He raised his
thumb. No 1 spoke into the little sphere of wire mesh that rose
in front of his mouth from the base of the head set. ‘No 1
speaking.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No 2 listening.’ The voice was hollow. The words waxed and
waned. But it was Blofeld, all right. No 1 knew that voice better
than he remembered his father’s.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Successful. Ten fifteen. Next phase ten forty-five. Continuing.
Over.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thank you. Out.’ The sound waves went dead. The interchange
had taken forty-five seconds. No conceivable fear of
interception in that time, on that waveband.</p>

<p class="pindent">No 1 went through the big stateroom and down into the hold.
The four men of B team, their aqualungs beside them, were sitting
around smoking. The wide underwater hatch just above
the keel of the yacht was open. Moonlight, reflected off the
white sand under the ship, shone up through the six feet of
water in the hold. Stacked on the grating beside the men was
the thick pile of tarpaulin painted a very pale café-au-lait with
occasional irregular blotches of dark green and brown. No 1
said, ‘All is going very well. The recovery team is at work. It
should not be long now. How about the chariot and the sled?’</p>

<p class="pindent">One of the men jerked his thumb downwards. ‘They are
down there. Outside on the sand. So it will be quicker.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Correct.’ No 1 nodded towards a crane-like contraption
fastened to a bulkhead above the hold. ‘The derrick took the
strain all right?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That chain could handle twice the weight.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The pumps?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘In order. They will clear the hold in seven minutes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good. Well, take it easy. It will be a long night.’ No 1
climbed the iron ladder out of the hold and went up on deck.
He didn’t need his night glasses. Two hundred yards away to
starboard the sea was empty save for the jolly-boat riding at
anchor above the golden submarine glow. The red marker
light had been taken in to the boat. The rattle of the little
generator making current for the big searchlight was loud. It
would carry far across a sea as still as this. But accumulators
would have been too bulky and might have exhausted themselves
before the work was finished. The generator was a
calculated risk and a small one at that. The nearest island was
five miles away and uninhabited unless someone was having a
midnight picnic on it. The yacht had stopped and searched
it on the way to the rendezvous. Everything had been done
that could be done, every precaution taken. The wonderful
machine was running silently and full out. There was nothing
to worry about now except the next step. No 1 went through
the hatch into the enclosed bridge and bent over the lighted
chart table.</p>

<p class="pindent">Emilio Largo, No 1, was a big, conspicuously handsome
man of about forty. He was a Roman and he looked like a
Roman, not from the Rome of today, but from the Rome of the
ancient coins. The large, long face was sunburned a deep
mahogany brown and the light glinted off the strong rather
hooked nose and the clean-cut lantern jaw that had been
meticulously shaved before he had started out late that afternoon.
In contrast to the hard, slow-moving brown eyes, the
mouth, with its thick, rather down-curled lips, belonged to a
satyr. Ears that, from dead in front, looked almost pointed,
added to an animalness that would devastate women. The only
weakness in the fine centurion face lay in the overlong sideburns
and the too carefully waved black hair that glistened
so brightly with pomade that it might almost have been
painted on to the skull. There was no fat on the big-boned
frame—Largo had fought for Italy in the Olympic foils, was
almost an Olympic class swimmer with the Australian crawl,
and only a month before had won the senior class in the Nassau
water-ski championships—the muscles bulged under the
exquisitely cut shark-skin jacket. An aid to his athletic prowess
were his hands. They were almost twice the normal size, even
for a man of his stature, and now, as they walked across the
chart holding a ruler and a pair of dividers, they looked,
extruding from the white sleeves that rested on the white
chart, almost like large brown furry animals quite separate
from their owner.</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo was an adventurer, a predator on the herd. Two hundred
years before, he would have been a pirate—not one of the
jolly ones of the story books, but a man like Blackbeard, a bloodstained
cut-throat who scythed his way through people towards
gold. But Blackbeard had been too much of a bully and a roughneck
and wherever he went in the world he left behind a telltale
shambles. Largo was different. There was a cool brain and
an exquisite finesse behind his actions that had always saved
him from the herd’s revenge—from his post-war debuts as
head of the black market in Naples, through five lucrative
years smuggling from Tangier, five more masterminding the
wave of big jewel robberies on the French Riviera, down to his
last five with <span class="g">SPECTRE</span>. Always he got away with it. Always he
had seen the essential step ahead that would have been hidden
from lesser men. He was the epitome of the gentleman crook—a
man of the world, a great womanizer, a high liver, with the
entrée to café society in four continents, and the last survivor,
conveniently enough, of a once-famous Roman family whose
fortune, so he said, he had inherited. He also benefited from
having no wife, a spotless police record, nerves of steel, a heart
of ice, and the ruthlessness of a Himmler. He was the perfect
man for <span class="g">SPECTRE</span>, and the perfect man, rich Nassau playboy
and all, to be Supreme Commander of Plan Omega.</p>

<p class="pindent">One of the crew knocked on the hatch and came in. ‘They
have signalled. The chariot and sled are on the way.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thank you.’ In the heat and excitement of any operation,
Largo always created calm. However much was at stake, however
great the dangers and however urgent the need for speed
and quick decisions, he made a fetish of calm, of the pause, of an
almost judolike inertia. This was an act of will to which he had
trained himself. He found it had an extraordinary effect on his
accomplices. It tied them to him and invoked their obedience
and loyalty more than any other factor in leadership. That he,
a clever and cunning man, should show unconcern at particularly
bad, or, as in this case, particularly good news, meant
that he had already known that what had happened would happen.
With Largo, consequences were foreseen. One could
depend on him. He never lost balance. So now, at this splendid
news, Largo deliberately picked up his dividers again and made
a trace, an imaginary trace, on the chart for the sake of the
crew member. He then put down the dividers and strolled out
of the air-conditioning into the warm night.</p>

<p class="pindent">A tiny worm of underwater light was creeping out towards
the jolly-boat. It was a two-man underwater chariot identical
with those used by the Italians during the war and bought,
with improvements, from Ansaldo, the firm that had originally
invented the one-man submarine. It was towing an underwater
sled, a sharp-prowed tray with negative buoyancy used for the
recovery and transport of heavy objects under the sea. The
worm of light merged with the luminescence from the searchlight
and, minutes later, re-emerged on its way back to the ship.
It would have been natural for Largo to have gone down to the
hold to witness the arrival of the two atomic weapons. Typically,
he did nothing of the sort. In due course the little headlight
reappeared, going back over its previous course. Now
the sled would be loaded with the huge tarpaulin, camouflaged
to merge in with just this piece of underwater terrain, with its
white sand and patches of coral outcrop, that would be spread
so as to cover every inch of the wrecked plane and pegged all
round with corkscrew iron stanchions that would not be
shifted by the heaviest surface storm or groundswell. In his
imagination, Largo saw every move of the eight men who would
now be working far below the surface on the reality for which
there had been so much training, so many dummy exercises.
He marvelled at the effort, the incredible ingenuity, that had
gone into Plan Omega. Now all the months of preparation, of
sweat and tears, were being repaid.</p>

<p class="pindent">There came a bright blink of light on the surface of the water
not far from the jolly-boat—then another and another. The
men were surfacing. As they did so, the moon caught the glass
of their masks. They swam to the boat—Largo verified that all
eight were there—and clumsily heaved up the short ladder and
over the side. The mechanic, and Brandt the German killer,
helped them off with their gear, the underwater light was
switched off and hauled inboard and, instead of the rattle of the
generator, there came the muffled roar of the twin Johnsons.
The boat sped back to the yacht and to the waiting arms of the
derricks. The couplings were made firm and verified, and with
a shrill electric whine, the boat, complete with passengers, was
swung up and inboard.</p>

<p class="pindent">The captain came and stood at Largo’s side. He was a big,
sullen, rawboned man who had been cashiered from the Canadian
Navy for drunkenness and insubordination. He had been a
slave to Largo ever since Largo had called him to the stateroom
one day and broken a chair over his head on account of a questioned
command. That was the kind of discipline he understood.
Now he said, ‘The hold’s clear. Okay to sail?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Are both the teams satisfied?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘They say so. Not a hitch.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘First see they all get one full jigger of whisky. Then tell
them to rest. They will be going out again in just about an hour.
Ask Kotze to have a word with me. Be ready to sail in five
minutes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Okay.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The eyes of the physicist, Kotze, were bright under the
moon. Largo noticed that he was trembling slightly as if with
fever. He tried to instil calm into the man. He said cheerfully,
‘Well, my friend. Are you pleased with your toys? The toy-shop
has sent you everything you want?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kotze’s lips trembled. He was on the verge of excited tears.
He said, his voice high. ‘It is tremendous! You have no idea.
Weapons such as I had never dreamed of. And of a simplicity—a
safety! Even a child could handle these things without
danger.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The cradles were big enough for them? You have room to
do your work?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, yes.’ Kotze almost flapped his hands with enthusiasm.
‘There are no problems, none at all. The fuses will be off in
no time. It will be a simple matter to replace them with
the time mechanism. Maslov is already at work correcting
the threads. I am using lead screws. They are more easy to
machine.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And the two plugs—these ignitors you were telling me
about? They are safe? Where did the divers find them?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘They were in a leaden box under the pilot’s seat. I have verified
them. Perfectly simple when the time comes. They will of
course be kept apart in the hiding place. The rubber bags are
splendid. Just what was needed. I have verified that they seal
completely watertight.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No danger from radiation?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not now. Everything is in the leaden cases.’ Kotze shrugged.
‘I may have picked up a little while I was working on the monsters
but I wore the harness. I will watch for signs. I know
what to do.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You are a brave man, Kotze. I won’t go near the damned
things until I have to. I value my sex-life too much. So you are
satisfied with everything? You have no problems? Nothing has
been left on the plane?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kotze had got himself under control. He had been bursting
with the news, with his relief that the technical problems were
within his power. Now he felt empty, tired. He had voided
himself of the tensions that had been with him for weeks. After
all this planning, all these dangers, supposing his knowledge
had not been enough! Supposing the bloody English had
invented some new safety device, some secret control, of which
he knew nothing! But when the time came, when he unwrapped
the protective webbing and got to work with his jeweller’s
tools, then triumph and gratitude had flooded into him. No,
now there were no problems. Everything was all right. Now
there was only routine. Kotze said dully, ‘No. There are no
problems. Everything is there. I will go and get the job
finished.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo watched the thin figure shamble off along the deck.
Scientists were queer fish. They saw nothing but science.
Kotze couldn’t visualize the risks that still had to be run. For
him the turning of a few screws was the end of the job. For the
rest of the time he would be a useless supercargo. It would
be easier to get rid of him. But that couldn’t be done yet. He
would have to be kept on just in case the weapons had to be
used. But he was a depressing little man and a near hysteric.
Largo didn’t like such people near him. They lowered his
spirits. They smelled of bad luck. Kotze would have to be
found some job in the engine room where he could be kept
busy and, above all, out of sight.</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo went into the cockpit bridge. The captain was sitting
at the wheel, a light aluminium affair consisting only of the
bottom half of a circle. Largo said, ‘Okay. Let’s go.’ The
captain reached out his hand to the bank of buttons at his side
and pressed the one that said ‘<span class="it">Start Both</span>’. There came a low,
hollow rumble from amidships. A light blinked on the panel
to show that both engines were firing properly. The captain
pulled the electro-magnetic gear shift to ‘<span class="it">Slow Ahead Both</span>’
and the yacht began to move. The captain made it ‘<span class="it">Full Ahead
Both</span>’ and the yacht trembled and settled a little in the stern.
The captain watched the revolution counter, his hand on a
squat lever at his side. At twenty knots the counter showed
5,000. The captain inched back the lever that depressed the
great steel scoop below the hull. The revolutions remained
the same, but the finger of the speedometer crawled on round
the dial until it said forty knots. Now the yacht was half-flying,
half-planing across the glittering sheet of still water, the
hull supported four feet above the surface on the broad, slightly
uptilted metal skid and with only a few feet of the stern and the
two big screws submerged. It was a glorious sensation and
Largo, as he always did, thrilled to it.</p>

<p class="pindent">The motor yacht, <span class="it">Disco Volante</span>, was a hydrofoil craft, built
for Largo with <span class="g">SPECTRE</span> funds by the Italian constructors,
Leopoldo Rodrigues, of Messina, the only firm in the world to
have successfully adapted the Shertel-Sachsenberg system to
commercial use. With a hull of aluminium and magnesium
alloy, two Daimler-Benz four-stroke diesels supercharged by
twin Brown-Boveri turbo superchargers, the <span class="it">Disco Volante</span>
could move her 100 tons at around fifty knots, with a cruising
range at that speed of around four hundred miles. She had cost
£200,000, but she had been the only craft in the world with the
speed, cargo and passenger space, and with the essential
shallow draft for the job required of her in Bahamian waters.</p>

<p class="pindent">The constructors claim of this type of craft that it has a particular
refinement that <span class="g">SPECTRE</span> had appreciated. Having high
stability and a shallow draft, <span class="it">Aliscafos</span>, as they are called in
Italy, do not determine magnetic field variation, nor do they
cause pressure waves—both desirable characteristics, in case
the <span class="it">Disco Volante</span> might wish, some time in her career, to escape
detection.</p>

<p class="pindent">Six months before, the <span class="it">Disco</span> had been shipped out to the
Florida Keys by the South Atlantic route. She had been a
sensation in Florida waters and among the Bahamas, and had
vastly helped to make Largo the most popular ‘millionaire’ in a
corner of the world that crawls with millionaires who ‘have
everything’. And the fast and mysterious voyages he made in the
<span class="it">Disco</span>, with all those underwater swimmers and occasionally
with a two-seater Lycoming-engined folding-wing amphibian
mounted on the roof of the streamlined superstructure, had
aroused just the right amount of excited comment. Slowly,
Largo had let the secret leak out—through his own discretions
at dinners and cocktail parties, through carefully primed
members of the crew in the Bay Street bars. This was a treasure
hunt, an important one. There was a pirates’ map, a sunken
galleon thickly overgrown with coral. The wreck had been
located. Largo was only waiting for the end of the winter
tourist season and for the calms of early summer and then his
shareholders would be coming out from Europe and work
would begin in earnest. And two days before, the shareholders,
nineteen of them, had duly come trickling in to Nassau by
different routes—from Bermuda, from New York, from
Miami. Rather dull looking people to be sure, just the sort of
hard-headed, hard-working businessmen who would be
amused by a gamble like this, a pleasant sunshine gamble with
a couple of weeks’ holiday in Nassau to make up for it if the
doubloons were after all not in the wreck. And that evening,
with all the visitors on board, the engines of the <span class="it">Disco</span> had begun
to murmur, just when they should have, the harbour folk
agreed, just when it was getting dark, and the beautiful dark
blue and white yacht had slid out of harbour. Once in the
open sea, the engines had started up their deep booming that
had gradually diminished to the south-east, towards, the
listeners agreed, an entirely appropriate hunting ground.</p>

<p class="pindent">The southerly course was considered appropriate because it
is among the Southern Bahamas that the great local treasure
troves are expected to be found. It was through the southerly
passages through these islands—the Crooked Island, the
Mayaguana and the Caicos passages—that the Spanish treasure
ships would try to dodge the pirates and the French and British
fleets as they made for home. Here, it is believed, lie the remains
of the <span class="it">Porto Pedro</span>, sunk in 1668, with a million pounds
of bullion on board. The <span class="it">Santa Cruz</span>, lost in 1694, carried
twice as much, and the <span class="it">El Capitan</span> and <span class="it">San Pedro</span>, both sunk
in 1719, carried a million, and half a million, pounds of treasure
respectively.</p>

<p class="pindent">Every year, treasure hunts for these and other ships are
carried out among the Southern Bahamas. No one can guess
how much, if anything, has been recovered, but everyone in
Nassau knows of the 72-lb. silver bar recovered by two Nassau
businessmen off Gorda Cay in 1950, and since presented to the
Nassau Development Board, in whose offices it is permanently
on view. So all Bahamians know that treasure is there for the
finding, and when the harbour folk of Nassau heard the deep
boom of the <span class="it">Disco’s</span> engines dying away to the south, they
nodded wisely.</p>

<p class="pindent">But once the <span class="it">Disco</span> was well away and the moon had not yet
risen, with all lights doused, she swung away in a wide circle towards
the west and towards the rendezvous point she was now
leaving. Now she was a hundred miles, two hours, away from
Nassau. But it would be almost dawn when, after one more vital
call, Nassau would again hear the boom of her engines coming
in from the false southern trail.</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo got up and bent over the chart table. They had covered
the course many times and in all weathers. It was really no
problem. But Phases I and II had gone so well that double care
must be taken over Phase III. Yes, all was well. They were
dead on course. Fifty miles. They would be there in an hour.
He told the captain to keep the yacht as she was, and went
below to the radio room. Eleven fifteen was just coming up.
It was call time.</p>

<p class="pindent">The small island, Dog Island, was no bigger than two tennis
courts. It was a hunk of dead coral with a smattering of sea-grape
and battered screw palm that grew on nothing but
pockets of brackish rainwater and sand. It was the point where
the Dog Shoal broke the surface, a well-known navigational
hazard that even the fishing boats kept well away from. In
daylight, Andros Island showed to eastwards, but at night it
was as safe as houses.</p>

<p class="pindent">The <span class="it">Disco</span> came up fast and then slowly lowered herself back
into the water and slid up within a cable’s length of the rock.
Her arrival brought small waves that lapped and sucked at the
rock and then were still. The anchor slipped silently down
forty feet and held. Down in the hold, Largo and the disposal
team of four waited for the underwater hatch to be opened.</p>

<p class="pindent">The five men wore aqualungs. Largo held nothing but a
powerful underwater electric torch. The four others were
divided into two pairs. They wore webbing slung between
them and they sat on the edge of the iron grating with their
frogman’s feet dangling, waiting for the water to swirl in and
give them buoyancy. On the webbing, between each pair,
rested a six-foot-long tapering object in an obscene grey
rubber envelope.</p>

<p class="pindent">The water seeped, rushed, and then burst into the hold, submerging
the five men. They slipped off their seats and trudged
out through the hatchway, Largo in the lead and the two pairs
behind him at precisely tested intervals.</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo did not at first switch on his torch. It was not necessary
and it would bring stupid, dazed fish that were a distraction. It
might even bring shark or barracuda and, though they would
be no more than a nuisance, one of the team, despite Largo’s
assurances, might lose his nerve.</p>

<p class="pindent">They swam on in the soft moonlit mist of the sea. At first
there was nothing but a milky void below them, but then the
coral shelf of the island showed up, climbing steeply towards the
surface. Sea fans, like small shrouds in the moonlight, waved
softly, beckoning, and the clumps and trees of coral were grey
and enigmatic. It was because of these things, the harmless
underwater mysteries that make the skin crawl on the inexperienced,
that Largo had decided to lead the disposal teams himself.
Out in the open, where the plane had foundered, the eye
of the big searchlight made, with the known object of the plane
itself, the underwater world into the semblance of a big room.
But this was different. This grey-white world needed the contempt
of a swimmer who had experienced these phantom
dangers a thousand times before. That was the main reason
why Largo led the teams. He also wanted to know exactly how
the two grey sausages were stored away. It could happen, if
things went wrong, that he would have to salvage them
himself.</p>

<p class="pindent">The underpart of the small island had been eroded by the
waves so that, seen from below, it resembled a thick mushroom.
Under the umbrella of coral there was a wide fissure, a
dark wound in the side of the stem. Largo made for it and,
when he was close, switched on his torch. Beneath the umbrella
of coral it was dark. The yellow light of the torch showed up
the minute life of an inshore coral community—the pale sea
urchins and the fierce black spines of sea eggs, the shifting
underbrush of seaweeds, the yellow and blue seeking antennae
of a langouste, the butterfly and angel fish, fluttering like
moths in the light, a coiled <span class="it">bêche de mer</span>, a couple of meandering
sea-caterpillars and the black and green jelly of a sea-hare.</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo lowered the black fins on his feet, got his balance on a
ledge, and looked round, shining his torch on the rock so that
the two teams could get a foothold. Then he waved them on and
into the smooth broad fissure that showed a glimmer of moonlight
at its far end inside the centre of the rock. The underwater
cave was only about ten yards long. Largo led the teams
one after the other through and into the small chamber that
might once perhaps have been a wonderful repository for a
different kind of treasure. From the chamber a narrow fissure
led to the upper air and this would certainly become a fine
blow-hole in a storm, though it would be unlikely that fishermen
would be close enough to the Dog Shoal in a storm to see
the water fountaining out of the centre of the island. Above the
present waterline in the chamber, Largo’s men had hammered
stanchions into the rock to form cradles for the two atomic
weapons with leather straps to hold them secure against any
weather. Now, one by one, the two teams lifted the rubber
packages up on the iron bars and made them secure. Largo
examined the result and was satisfied. The weapons would be
ready for him when he needed them. In the meantime such
radiation as there was would be quarantined within this tiny
rock a hundred miles from Nassau and his men and his ship
would be clean and innocent as snow.</p>

<p class="pindent">The five men trudged calmly back to the ship and into the
hold through the hatch. To the boom of the engines the bows of
the <span class="it">Disco</span> lifted slowly out of the water and the beautiful ship,
streamlined like the gondola of some machine of the air rather
than of the sea, skimmed off on the homeward journey.</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo stripped off his equipment, and with a towel round his
slim waist, went for’ard to the radio cabin. He had missed the
midnight call. It was now one fifteen—seven fifteen in the
morning for Blofeld.</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo thought of this while contact was being made. Blofeld
would be sitting there, haggard perhaps, probably unshaven.
There would be coffee beside him, the last of an endless chain
of cups. Largo could smell it. Now Blofeld would be able to
take a taxi to the Turkish baths in the Rue Aubert, his resort
when there were tensions to be dissipated. And there, at least,
he would sleep.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Number 1 speaking.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Number 2 listening.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Phase III completed. Phase III completed. Successful. One
am here. Closing down.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I am satisfied.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Largo stripped off the earphones. He thought to himself, ‘So
am I! We are more than three-quarters home. Now only the
devil can stop us.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He went in to the stateroom and carefully made himself a tall
glass of his favourite drink—crème de menthe frappé with a
