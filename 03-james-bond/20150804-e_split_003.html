<p class="pindent">The two thirty-eights roared simultaneously.</p>

<p class="pindent">The walls of the underground room took the crash of
sound and batted it to and fro between them until there was
silence. James Bond watched the smoke being sucked from
each end of the room towards the central Ventaxia fan. The
memory in his right hand of how he had drawn and fired
with one sweep from the left made him confident. He broke
the chamber sideways out of the Colt Detective Special and
waited, his gun pointing at the floor, while the Instructor
walked the twenty yards towards him through the half-light
of the gallery.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond saw that the Instructor was grinning. “I don’t believe
it,” he said. “I got you that time.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The Instructor came up with him. “I’m in hospital, but
you’re dead, sir,” he said. In one hand he held the silhouette
target of the upper body of a man. In the other a polaroid
film, postcard size. He handed this to Bond and they turned
to a table behind them on which there was a green-shaded
desk-light and a large magnifying glass.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond picked up the glass and bent over the photograph. It
was a flash-light photograph of him. Around his right hand
there was a blurred burst of white flame. He focused the glass
carefully on the left side of his dark jacket. In the centre of his
heart there was a tiny pinpoint of light.</p>

<p class="pindent">Without speaking, the Instructor laid the big white man-shaped
target under the lamp. Its heart was a black bullseye,
about three inches across. Just below and half an inch to the
right was the rent made by Bond’s bullet.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Through the left wall of the stomach and out at the
back,” said the Instructor, with satisfaction. He took out a
pencil and scribbled an addition on the side of the target.
“Twenty rounds and I make it you owe me seven-and-six,
sir,” he said impassively.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. He counted out some silver. “Double the
stakes next Monday,” he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s all right with me,” said the Instructor. “But you
can’t beat the machine, sir. And if you want to get into the
team for the Dewar Trophy we ought to give the thirty-eights
a rest and spend some time on the Remington. That
new long twenty-two cartridge they’ve just brought out is
going to mean at least 7900 out of a possible 8000 to win.
Most of your bullets have got to be in the X-ring and that’s
only as big as a shilling when it’s under your nose. At a
hundred yards it isn’t there at all.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“To hell with the Dewar Trophy,” said Bond. “It’s your
money I’m after.” He shook the unfired bullets in the
chamber of his gun into his cupped hand and laid them and
the gun on the table. “See you Monday. Same time?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Ten o’clock’ll be fine, sir,” said the Instructor, jerking
down the two handles on the iron door. He smiled at Bond’s
back as it disappeared up the steep concrete stairs leading to
the ground floor. He was pleased with Bond’s shooting, but
he wouldn’t have thought of telling him that he was the best
shot in the Service. Only M. was allowed to know that, and
his Chief of Staff, who would be told to enter the scores of
that day’s shoot on Bond’s Confidential Record.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond pushed through the green baize door at the top of
the basement steps and walked over to the lift that would
take him up to the eighth floor of the tall, grey building near
Regent’s Park that is the headquarters of the Secret Service.
He was satisfied with his score but not proud of it. His trigger
finger twitched in his pocket as he wondered how to conjure
up that little extra flash of speed that would beat the
machine, the complicated box of tricks that sprung the target
for just three seconds, fired back at him with a blank .38, and
shot a pencil of light aimed at him and photographed it as he
stood and fired from the circle of chalk on the floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">The lift doors sighed open and Bond got in. The liftman
could smell the cordite on him. They always smelled like that
when they came up from the shooting gallery. He liked it. It
reminded him of the Army. He pressed the button for the
eighth and rested the stump of his left arm against the control
handle.</p>

<p class="pindent">If only the light was better, thought Bond. But M. insisted
that all shooting should be done in averagely bad conditions.
A dim light and a target that shot back at you was as close as
he could get to copying the real thing. ‘Shooting hell out of a
piece of cardboard doesn’t prove anything’ was his single-line
introduction to the Small-arms Defence Manual.</p>

<p class="pindent">The lift eased to a stop and as Bond stepped out into the
drab Ministry-of-Works-green corridor and into the bustling
world of girls carrying files, doors opening and shutting, and
muted telephone bells, he emptied his mind of all thoughts
of his shoot and prepared himself for the normal business of
a routine day at Headquarters.</p>

<p class="pindent">He walked along to the end door on the right. It was as
anonymous as all the others he had passed. No numbers. If
you had any business on the eighth floor, and your office was
not on that floor, someone would come and fetch you to the
room you needed and see you back into the lift when you
were through.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond knocked and waited. He looked at his watch. Eleven
o’clock. Mondays were hell. Two days of dockets and files to
plough through. And week-ends were generally busy times
abroad. Empty flats got burgled. People were photographed
in compromising positions. Motor-car ‘accidents’ looked
better, got a more cursory handling, amidst the week-end
slaughter on the roads. The weekly bags from Washington,
Istanbul, and Tokyo would have come in and been sorted.
They might hold something for him.</p>

<p class="pindent">The door opened and he had his daily moment of pleasure
at having a beautiful secretary. “Morning, Lil,” he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">The careful warmth of her smile of welcome dropped
about ten degrees.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Give me that coat,” she said. “It stinks of cordite. And
don’t call me Lil. You know I hate it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took off his coat and handed it to her. “Anyone who
gets christened Loelia Ponsonby ought to get used to pet
names.”</p>

<p class="pindent">He stood beside her desk in the little anteroom which she
had somehow made to seem a little more human than an
office and watched her hang his coat on the iron frame of
the open window.</p>

<p class="pindent">She was tall and dark with a reserved, unbroken beauty to
which the war and five years in the Service had lent a touch
of sternness. Unless she married soon, Bond thought for the
hundredth time, or had a lover, her cool air of authority
might easily become spinsterish and she would join the army
of women who had married a career.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had told her as much, often, and he and the two
other members of the 00 Section had at various times made
determined assaults on her virtue. She had handled them all
with the same cool motherliness (which, to salve their egos,
they privately defined as frigidity) and, the day after, she
treated them with small attentions and kindnesses to show
that it was really her fault and that she forgave them.</p>

<p class="pindent">What they didn’t know was that she worried herself almost
to death when they were in danger and that she loved them
equally; but that she had no intention of becoming emotionally
involved with any man who might be dead next week.
And it was true that an appointment in the Secret Service was
a form of peonage. If you were a woman there wasn’t much
of you left for other relationships. It was easier for the men.
They had an excuse for fragmentary affairs. For them
marriage and children and a home were out of the question
if they were to be of any use ‘in the field’ as it was cosily
termed. But, for the women, an affair outside the Service
automatically made you a ‘security risk’ and in the last analysis
you had a choice of resignation from the Service and a
normal life, or of perpetual concubinage to your King and
Country.</p>

<p class="pindent">Loelia Ponsonby knew that she had almost reached the
time for decision and all her instincts told her to get out. But
every day the drama and romance of her Cavell-Nightingale
world locked her more securely into the company of the other
girls at Headquarters and every day it seemed more difficult
to betray by resignation the father-figure which The Service
had become.</p>

<p class="pindent">Meanwhile she was one of the most envied girls in the
building, and a member of the small company of Principal
Secretaries who had access to the innermost secrets of the
Service—‘The Pearls and Twin-set’ as they were called behind
their backs by the other girls, with ironical reference to
their supposedly ‘County’ and ‘Kensington’ backgrounds—and,
so far as the Personnel Branch was concerned, her destiny
in twenty years’ time would be that single golden line
right at the end of a New Year’s Honours List, among the
medals for officials of the Fishery Board, of the Post Office,
of the Women’s Institute, towards the bottom of the OBEs:
‘Miss Loelia Ponsonby, Principal Secretary in the Ministry
of Defence.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She turned away from the window. She was dressed in a
sugar-pink and white striped shirt and a plain dark blue skirt.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled into her grey eyes. “I only call you Lil on
Mondays,” he said. “Miss Ponsonby the rest of the week. But
I’ll never call you Loelia. It sounds like somebody in an indecent
limerick. Any messages?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No,” she said shortly. She relented. “But there’s piles of
stuff on your desk. Nothing urgent. But there’s an awful lot
of it. Oh, and the powder-vine says that 008’s got out. He’s
in Berlin, resting. Isn’t it wonderful!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked quickly at her. “When did you hear that?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“About half an hour ago,” she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond opened the inner door to the big office with the three
desks and shut it behind him. He went and stood by the
window, looking out at the late spring green of the trees in
Regent’s Park. So Bill had made it after all. Peenemunde and
back. Resting in Berlin sounded bad. Must be in pretty poor
shape. Well, he’d just have to wait for news from the only
leak in the building—the girls’ rest-room, known to the impotent
fury of the Security staff as ‘The powder-vine’.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sighed and sat down at his desk, pulling towards him
the tray of brown folders bearing the top-secret red star. And
what about 0011? It was two months since he had vanished
into the ‘Dirty Half-mile’ in Singapore. Not a word since.
While he, Bond, No. 007, the senior of the three men in the
Service who had earned the double 0 number, sat at his comfortable
desk doing paper-work and flirting with their secretary.</p>

<p class="pindent">He shrugged his shoulders and resolutely opened the top
folder. Inside there was a detailed map of southern Poland
and north-eastern Germany. Its feature was a straggling red
line connecting Warsaw and Berlin. There was also a long
typewritten memorandum headed <span class="it">Mainline: A well-established
Escape Route from East to West</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took out his black gunmetal cigarette-box and his
black-oxidized Ronson lighter and put them on the desk
beside him. He lit a cigarette, one of the Macedonian blend
with the three gold rings round the butt that Morlands of
Grosvenor Street made for him, then he settled himself
forward in the padded swivel chair and began to read.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was the beginning of a typical routine day for Bond. It
was only two or three times a year that an assignment came
along requiring his particular abilities. For the rest of the
year he had the duties of an easy-going senior civil servant—elastic
office hours from around ten to six; lunch, generally
in the canteen; evenings spent playing cards in the company
of a few close friends, or at Crockford’s; or making love, with
rather cold passion, to one of three similarly disposed married
women; week-ends playing golf for high stakes at one of the
clubs near London.</p>

<p class="pindent">He took no holidays, but was generally given a fortnight’s
leave at the end of each assignment—in addition to any sick-leave
that might be necessary. He earned £1500 a year, the
salary of a Principal Officer in the Civil Service, and he had
a thousand a year free of tax of his own. When he was on a
job he could spend as much as he liked, so for the other
months of the year he could live very well on his £2000 a
year net.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had a small but comfortable flat off the Kings Road,
an elderly Scottish housekeeper—a treasure called May—and
a 1930 4½-litre Bentley coupé, supercharged, which he
kept expertly tuned so that he could do a hundred when he
wanted to.</p>

<p class="pindent">On these things he spent all his money and it was his
ambition to have as little as possible in his banking account
when he was killed, as, when he was depressed, he knew he
would be, before the statutory age of forty-five.</p>

<p class="pindent">Eight years to go before he was automatically taken off
the 00 list and given a staff job at Headquarters. At least
eight tough assignments. Probably sixteen. Perhaps twenty-four.
Too many.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were five cigarette-ends in the big glass ashtray by
the time Bond had finished memorizing the details of ‘Mainline’.
He picked up a red pencil and ran his eye down the
distribution list on the cover. The list started with ‘M.’, then
‘CoS.’, then a dozen or so letters and numbers and then, at
the end ‘00’. Against this he put a neat tick, signed it with the
figure 7, and tossed the file into his OUT tray.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was twelve o’clock. Bond took the next folder off the
pile and opened it. It was from the Radio Intelligence Division
of NATO, ‘For Information Only’ and it was headed
‘Radio Signatures’.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond pulled the rest of the pile towards him and glanced
at the first page of each. These were their titles:</p>

<p class="pindent"><span class="it">The Inspectoscope—a machine for the detection of contraband.</span></p>

<p class="pindent"><span class="it">Philopon—A Japanese murder-drug.</span></p>

<p class="pindent"><span class="it">Possible points of concealment on trains. No. 11. Germany.</span></p>

<p class="pindent"><span class="it">The methods of Smersh. No. 6. Kidnapping.</span></p>

<p class="pindent"><span class="it">Route five to Pekin.</span></p>

<p class="pindent"><span class="it">Vladivostock. A photographic Reconnaissance by U.S.
Thunderjet.</span></p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was not surprised by the curious mixture he was
supposed to digest. The 00 Section of the Secret Service was
not concerned with the current operations of other sections
and stations, only with background information which might
be useful or instructive to the only three men in the Service
whose duties included assassination—who might be ordered
to kill. There was no urgency about these files. No action was
required by him or his two colleagues except that each of
them jotted down the numbers of dockets which he considered
the other two should also read when they were next
attached to Headquarters. When the 00 Section had
finished with this lot they would go down to their final destination
in ‘Records’.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned back to the NATO paper.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The almost inevitable manner’, he read, ‘in which individuality
is revealed by minute patterns of behaviour, is
demonstrated by the indelible characteristics of the “fist” of
each radio operator. This “fist”, or manner of tapping out
messages, is distinctive and recognizable by those who are
practised in receiving messages. It can also be measured by
very sensitive mechanisms. To illustrate, in 1943 the United
States Radio Intelligence Bureau made use of this fact in
tracing an enemy station in Chile operated by “Pedro”, a
young German. When the Chilean police closed in on the
station, “Pedro” escaped. A year later, expert listeners
spotted a new illegal transmitter and were able to recognize
“Pedro” as the operator. In order to disguise his “fist” he
was transmitting left-handed, but the disguise was not effective
and he was captured.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘NATO Radio Research has recently been experimenting
with a form of “scrambler” which can be attached to the
wrist of operators with the object of interfering minutely with
the nerve centres which control the muscles of the hand.
However . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">There were three telephones on Bond’s desk. A black one
for outside calls, a green office telephone, and a red one which
went only to M. and his Chief of Staff. It was the familiar
burr of the red one that broke the silence of the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was M’s Chief of Staff.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Can you come up?” asked the pleasant voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">“M.?” asked Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Any clue?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Simply said if you were about he’d like to see you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Right,” said Bond, and put down the receiver.</p>

<p class="pindent">He collected his coat, told his secretary he would be with
M. and not to wait for him, left his office and walked along
the corridor to the lift.</p>

<p class="pindent">While he waited for it, he thought of those other times,
when, in the middle of an empty day, the red telephone had
suddenly broken the silence and taken him out of one world
and set him down in another. He shrugged his shoulders—Monday!
He might have expected trouble.</p>

<p class="pindent">The lift came. “Ninth,” said Bond, and stepped in.</p>
