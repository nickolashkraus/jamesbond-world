<p class="pindent">There was a moment’s silence at the table. It was broken
by the agitated voice of Meyer.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Here I say,” he said anxiously. “Don’t include me in on
this, Hugger.” He knew it was a private bet with Bond, but
he wanted to show Drax that he was thoroughly nervous
about the whole affair. He saw himself making some ghastly
mistake that would cost his partner a lot of money.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’t be ridiculous, Max,” said Drax harshly. “You play
your hand. This is nothing to do with you. Just an enjoyable
little bet with our rash friend here. Come along, come along.
My deal, Admiral.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M. cut the cards and the game began.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond lit a cigarette with hands that had suddenly become
quite steady. His mind was clear. He knew exactly what he
had to do, and when, and he was glad that the moment of
decision had come.</p>

<p class="pindent">He sat back in his chair and for a moment he had the impression
that there was a crowd behind him at each elbow,
and that faces were peering over his shoulder, waiting to see
his cards. He somehow felt that the ghosts were friendly,
that they approved of the rough justice that was about to be
done.</p>

<p class="pindent">He smiled as he caught himself sending this company of
dead gamblers a message, that they should see that all went
well.</p>

<p class="pindent">The background noise of the famous gaming room broke
in on his thoughts. He looked round. In the middle of the
long room, under the central chandelier, there were several
onlookers round the poker game. ‘Raise you a hundred.’
‘And a hundred.’ ‘And a hundred.’ ‘Damn you. I’ll look’, and
a shout of triumph followed by a hubbub of comment. In
the distance he could hear the rattle of a croupier’s rake
against the counters at the Shemmy game. Nearer at hand,
at his end of the room, there were three other tables of bridge
over which the smoke of cigars and cigarettes rose towards
the barrelled ceiling.</p>

<p class="pindent">Nearly every night for more than a hundred and fifty years
there had been just such a scene, he reflected, in this famous
room. The same cries of victory and defeat, the same dedicated
faces, the same smell of tobacco and drama. For Bond,
who loved gambling, it was the most exciting spectacle in
the world. He gave it a last glance to fix it all in his mind
and then he turned back to his table.</p>

<p class="pindent">He picked up his cards and his eyes glittered. For once,
on Drax’s deal, he had a cast-iron game hand; seven spades
with the four top honours, the ace of hearts, and the ace,
king of diamonds. He looked at Drax. Had he and Meyer got
the clubs? Even so Bond could overbid. Would Drax try and
force him too high and risk a double? Bond waited.</p>

<p class="pindent">“No bid,” said Drax, unable to keep the bitterness of his
private knowledge of Bond’s hand out of his voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Four spades,” said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">No bid from Meyer; from M.; reluctantly from Drax.</p>

<p class="pindent">M. provided some help, and they made five.</p>

<p class="pindent">One hundred and fifty points below the line. A hundred
above for honours.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Humph,” said a voice at Bond’s elbow. He looked up. It
was Basildon. His game had finished and he had strolled
over to see what was happening on this separate battlefield.</p>

<p class="pindent">He picked up Bond’s score-sheet and looked at it.</p>

<p class="pindent">“That was a bit of a beetle-crusher,” he said cheerfully.
“Seems you’re holding the champions. What are the
stakes?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond left the answer to Drax. He was glad of the diversion.
It could not have been better timed. Drax had cut the
blue cards to him. He married the two halves and put the
pack just in front of him, near the edge of the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Fifteen and fifteen. On my left,” said Drax.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond heard Basildon draw in his breath.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Chap seemed to want to gamble, so I accommodated
him. Now he goes and gets all the cards . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax grumbled on.</p>

<p class="pindent">Across the table, M. saw a white handkerchief materialize
in Bond’s right hand. M.’s eyes narrowed. Bond seemed to
wipe his face with it. M. saw him glance sharply at Drax and
Meyer, then the handkerchief was back in his pocket.</p>

<p class="pindent">A blue pack was in Bond’s hands and he had started to
deal.</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s the hell of a stake,” said Basildon. “We once had
a thousand-pound side-bet on a game of bridge. But that was
in the rubber boom before the ’fourteen-eighteen war. Hope
nobody’s going to get hurt.” He meant it. Very high stakes
in a private game generally led to trouble. He walked round
and stood between M. and Drax.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond completed the deal. With a touch of anxiety he
picked up his cards.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had nothing but five clubs to the ace, queen, ten, and
eight small diamonds to the queen.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was all right. The trap was set.</p>

<p class="pindent">He almost felt Drax stiffen as the big man thumbed
through his cards, and then, unbelieving, thumbed them
through again. Bond knew that Drax had an incredibly
good hand. Ten certain tricks, the ace, king of diamonds,
the four top honours in spades, the four top honours in
hearts, and the king, knave, nine of clubs.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had dealt them to him—in the Secretary’s room before
dinner.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond waited, wondering how Drax would react to the
huge hand. He took an almost cruel interest in watching the
greedy fish come to the lure.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax exceeded his expectations.</p>

<p class="pindent">Casually he folded his hand and laid it on the table. Nonchalantly
he took the flat carton out of his pocket, selected
a cigarette and lit it. He didn’t look at Bond. He glanced up
at Basildon.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes,” he said, continuing the conversation about their
stakes. “It’s a high game, but not the highest I’ve ever played.
Once played for two thousand a rubber in Cairo. At the
Mahomet Ali as a matter of fact. They’ve really got guts
there. Often bet on every trick as well as on the game and
rubber. Now,” he picked up his hand and looked slyly at
Bond. “I’ve got some good tickets here. I’ll admit it. But
then you may have too, for all I know.” (Unlikely, you old
shark, thought Bond, with three of the ace-kings in your own
hand.) “Care to have something extra just on this hand?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond made a show of studying his cards with the minuteness
of someone who is nearly very drunk. “I’ve got a promising
lot too,” he said thickly. “If my partner fits and the cards
lie right I might make a lot of tricks myself. What are you
suggesting?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sounds as if we’re pretty evenly matched,” lied Drax.
“What do you say to a hundred a trick on the side? From
what you say it shouldn’t be too painful.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked thoughtful and rather fuddled. He took
another careful look at his hand, running through the cards
one by one. “All right,” he said. “You’re on. And frankly
you’ve made me gamble. You’ve obviously got a big hand, so
I must shut you out and chance it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked blearily across at M. “Pay your losses on this
one, partner,” he said. “Here we go. Er—seven clubs.”</p>

<p class="pindent">In the dead silence that followed, Basildon, who had seen
Drax’s hand, was so startled that he dropped his whisky and
soda on the floor. He looked dazedly down at the broken
glass and let it lie.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax said “What?” in a startled voice and hastily ran
through his cards again for reassurance.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Did you say grand slam in clubs?” he asked, looking
curiously at his obviously drunken opponent. “Well, it’s your
funeral. What do you say, Max?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No bid,” said Meyer, feeling in the air the electricity of
just that crisis he had hoped to avoid. Why the hell hadn’t
he gone home before this last rubber? He groaned inwardly.</p>

<p class="pindent">“No bid,” said M. apparently unperturbed.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Double.” The word came viciously out of Drax’s mouth.
He put down his hand and looked cruelly, scornfully at this
tipsy oaf who had at last, inexplicably, fallen into his hands.</p>

<p class="pindent">“That mean you double the side-bets too?” asked Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes,” said Drax greedily. “Yes. That’s what I meant.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“All right,” said Bond. He paused. He looked at Drax and
not at his hand. “Redouble. The contract and the side-bets.
£400 a trick on the side.”</p>

<p class="pindent">It was at that moment that the first hint of a dreadful,
incredible doubt entered Drax’s mind. But again he looked at
his hand, and again he was reassured. At the very worst he
couldn’t fail to make two tricks.</p>

<p class="pindent">A muttered “No bid” from Meyer. A rather strangled “No
bid” from M. An impatient shake of the head from Drax.</p>

<p class="pindent">Basildon stood, his face very pale, looking intently across
the table at Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he walked slowly round the table, scrutinizing all
the hands. What he saw was this:</p>

<div class="literal-container"><div class="literal"> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class="line2">BOND</p>
<p class="pindent1">♢ Queen, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2</p>
<p class="pindent1">♣ Ace, queen, 10, 8, 4</p>
<p class="pindent1"> </p>
<p class="line2">DRAX</p>
<p class="pindent1">♠ Ace, king, queen, knave</p>
<p class="pindent1">♡ Ace, king, queen, knave</p>
<p class="pindent1">♢ Ace, king</p>
<p class="pindent1">♣ King, knave, 9</p>
<p class="pindent1"> </p>
<p class="line2">MEYER</p>
<p class="pindent1">♠ 6, 5, 4, 3, 2</p>
<p class="pindent1">♡ 10, 9, 8, 7, 2</p>
<p class="pindent1">♢ Knave, 10, 9</p>
<p class="pindent1"> </p>
<p class="line2">M.</p>
<p class="pindent1">♠ 10, 9, 8, 7</p>
<p class="pindent1">♡ 6, 5, 4, 3</p>
<p class="pindent1">♣ 7, 6, 5, 3, 2</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class="pindent">And suddenly Basildon understood. It was a laydown
Grand Slam for Bond against any defence. Whatever Meyer
led, Bond must get in with a trump in his own hand or on
the table. Then, in between clearing trumps, finessing of
course against Drax, he would play two rounds of diamonds,
trumping them in dummy and catching Drax’s ace and king
in the process. After five plays he would be left with the
remaining trumps and six winning diamonds. Drax’s aces
and kings would be totally valueless.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was sheer murder.</p>

<p class="pindent">Basildon, almost in a trance, continued round the table
and stood between M. and Meyer so that he could watch
Drax’s face, and Bond’s. His own face was impassive, but
his hands, which he had stuffed into his trouser pockets so
that they would not betray him, were sweating. He waited,
almost fearfully, for the terrible punishment that Drax was
about to receive—thirteen separate lashes whose scars no
card-player would ever lose.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Come along, come along,” said Drax impatiently. “Lead
something, Max. Can’t be here all night.”</p>

<p class="pindent">You poor fool, thought Basildon. In ten minutes you’ll
wish that Meyer had died in his chair before he could pull
out that first card.</p>

<p class="pindent">In fact, Meyer looked as if at any moment he might have
a stroke. He was deathly pale, and the perspiration was
dropping off his chin on to his shirt front. For all he knew,
his first card might be a disaster.</p>

<p class="pindent">At last, reasoning that Bond might be void in his own long
suits, spades and hearts, he led the knave of diamonds.</p>

<p class="pindent">It made no difference what he led, but when M.’s hand
went down showing chicane in diamonds, Drax snarled
across at his partner. “Haven’t you got anything else, you
dam’ fool? Want to hand it to him on a plate? Whose side
are you on, anyway?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Meyer cringed into his clothes. “Best I could do, Hugger,”
he said miserably, wiping his face with his handkerchief.</p>

<p class="pindent">But by this time Drax had got his own worries.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond trumped on the table, catching Drax’s king of diamonds,
and promptly led a club. Drax put up his nine. Bond
took it with his ten and led a diamond, trumping it on the
table. Drax’s ace fell. Another club from the table, catching
Drax’s knave.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then the ace of clubs.</p>

<p class="pindent">As Drax surrendered his king, for the first time he saw
what might be happening. His eyes squinted anxiously at
Bond, waiting fearfully for the next card. Had Bond got the
diamonds? Hadn’t Meyer got them guarded? After all, he
had opened with them. Drax waited, his cards slippery with
sweat.</p>

<p class="pindent">Morphy, the great chess player, had a terrible habit. He
would never raise his eyes from the game until he knew his
opponent could not escape defeat. Then he would slowly lift
his great head and gaze curiously at the man across the board.
His opponent would feel the gaze and would slowly, humbly
raise his eyes to meet Morphy’s. At that moment he would
know that it was no good continuing the game. The eyes of
Morphy said so. There was nothing left but surrender.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now, like Morphy, Bond lifted his head and looked
straight into Drax’s eyes. Then he slowly drew out the queen
of diamonds and placed it on the table. Without waiting for
Meyer to play he followed it, deliberately, with the 8, 7, 6,
5, 4, and the two winning clubs.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he spoke. “That’s all, Drax,” he said quietly, and
sat slowly back in his chair.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax’s first reaction was to lurch forward and tear Meyer’s
cards out of his hand. He faced them on the table, scrabbling
feverishly among them for a possible winner.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he flung them back across the baize.</p>

<p class="pindent">His face was dead white, but his eyes blazed redly at Bond.
Suddenly he raised one clenched fist and crashed it on the
table among the pile of impotent aces and kings and queens
in front of him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Very low, he spat the words at Bond. “You’re a che . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s enough, Drax.” Basildon’s voice came across the
table like a whiplash. “None of that talk here. I’ve been
watching the whole game. Settle up. If you’ve got any complaints,
put them in writing to the Committee.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax got slowly to his feet. He stood away from his chair
and ran a hand through his wet red hair. The colour came
slowly back into his face and with it an expression of cunning.
He glanced down at Bond and there was in his good
eye a contemptuous triumph which Bond found curiously
disturbing.</p>

<p class="pindent">He turned to the table. “Good night, gentlemen,” he said,
looking at each of them with the same oddly scornful expression.
“I owe about £15,000. I will accept Meyer’s addition.”</p>

<p class="pindent">He leant forward and picked up his cigarette-case and
lighter.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he looked again at Bond and spoke very quietly, the
red moustache lifting slowly from the splayed upper teeth.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I should spend the money quickly, Commander Bond,”
he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he turned away from the table and walked swiftly
out of the room.</p>
