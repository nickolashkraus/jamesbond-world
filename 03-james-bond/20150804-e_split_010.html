<p class="pindent">Although he had not got to bed until two, Bond walked
into his headquarters punctually at ten the next morning.
He was feeling dreadful. As well as acidity and liver as
a result of drinking nearly two whole bottles of champagne,
he had a touch of the melancholy and spiritual deflation that
were partly the after-effects of the benzedrine and partly
reaction to the drama of the night before.</p>

<p class="pindent">When he went up in the lift towards another routine day,
the bitter taste of the midnight hours was still with him.</p>

<p class="pindent">After Meyer had scuttled thankfully off to bed, Bond had
taken the two packs of cards out of the pockets of his coat and
had put them on the table in front of Basildon and M. One
was the blue pack that Drax had cut to him and that he had
pocketed, substituting instead, under cover of his handkerchief,
the stacked blue pack in his right-hand pocket. The
other was the stacked red pack in his left-hand pocket which
had not been needed.</p>

<p class="pindent">He fanned the red pack out on the table and showed M.
and Basildon that it would have produced the same freak
grand slam that had defeated Drax.</p>

<p class="pindent">“It’s a famous Culbertson hand,” he explained. “He used
it to spoof his own quick-trick conventions. I had to doctor
a red and a blue pack. Couldn’t know which colour I would
be dealing with.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, it certainly went with a bang,” said Basildon gratefully.
“I expect he’ll put two and two together and either
stay away or play straight in future. Expensive evening for
him. Don’t let’s have any arguments about your winnings,”
he added. “You’ve done everyone—and particularly Drax—a
good turn tonight. Things might have gone wrong. Then it
would have been your fingers that would have got burned.
Cheque will reach you on Saturday.”</p>

<p class="pindent">They had said good-night and Bond, in a mood of anti-climax,
had gone off to bed. He had taken a mild sleeping
pill to try and clear his mind of the bizarre events of the evening
and prepare himself for the morning and the office.
Before he slept he reflected, as he had often reflected in other
moments of triumph at the card table, that the gain to the
winner is, in some odd way, always less than the loss to the
loser.</p>

<p class="pindent">When he closed the door behind him Loelia Ponsonby
looked curiously at the dark shadows under his eyes. He
noticed the glance, as she had intended.</p>

<p class="pindent">He grinned. “Partly work and partly play,” he explained.
“In strictly masculine company,” he added. “And thanks
very much for the benzedrine. It really was badly needed.
Hope I didn’t interfere with your evening?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course not,” she said, thinking of the dinner and the
library book she had abandoned when Bond telephoned. She
looked down at her shorthand pad. “The Chief of Staff telephoned
half an hour ago. He said that M. would be wanting
you today. He couldn’t say when. I told him that you’ve got
Unarmed Combat at three and he said to cancel it. That’s
all, except the dockets left over from yesterday.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thank heavens,” said Bond. “I couldn’t have stood
being thrown about by that dam’ Commando chap today.
Any news of 008?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes,” she said. “They say he’s all right. He’s been moved
to the military hospital at Wahnerheide. Apparently it’s only
shock.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond knew what ‘shock’ might mean in his profession.
“Good,” he said without conviction. He smiled at her and
went into his office and closed the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">He walked decisively round his desk to the chair, sat down,
and pulled the top file towards him. Monday was gone. This
was Tuesday. A new day. Closing his mind to his headache
and to thoughts about the night, he lit a cigarette and opened
the brown folder with the Top Secret red star on it. It was a
memorandum from the Office of the Chief Preventive Officer
of the United States Customs Branch and it was headed <span class="it">The
Inspectoscope</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">He focused his eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The Inspectoscope,’ he read, ‘is an instrument using fluoroscopic
principles for the detection of contraband. It is
manufactured by the Sicular Inspectoscope Company of San
Francisco and is widely used in American prisons for the
secret detection of metal objects concealed in the clothing or
on the person of criminals and prison visitors. It is also used
in the detection of IDB (Illicit Diamond Buying) and diamond
smuggling in the diamond fields of Africa and Brazil.
The instrument costs seven thousand dollars, is approximately
eight feet long by seven feet high and weighs nearly
three tons. It requires two trained operators. Experiments
have been made with this instrument in the customs hall of
the International Airport at Idlewild with the following
results . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond skipped two pages containing details of a number
of petty smuggling cases and studied the ‘Summary of Conclusions’
from which he deduced, with some irritation, that
he would have to think of some place other than his armpit
for carrying his ·25 Beretta the next time he travelled abroad.
He made a mental note to discuss the problem with the
Technical Devices Section.</p>

<p class="pindent">He ticked and initialled the distribution slip and automatically
reached for the next folder entitled <span class="it">Philopon. A
Japanese murder-drug.</span></p>

<p class="pindent">‘Philopon’, his mind was trying to wander and he dragged
it sharply back to the typewritten pages.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Philopon is the chief factor in the increase in crime in
Japan. According to the Welfare Ministry there are now
1,500,000 addicts in the country, of whom one million are
under the age of 20, and the Tokyo Metropolitan Police
attribute 70 per cent of juvenile crime to the influences of the
drug.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Addiction, as in the case of marijuana in the United
States, begins with one “shot”. The effect is “stimulating”
and the drug is habit-forming. It is also cheap—about ten
yen (sixpence) a shot—and the addict rapidly increases his
shots to the neighbourhood of one hundred a day. In these
quantities the addiction becomes expensive and the victim
automatically turns to crime to pay for the drug. That the
crime often includes physical assault and murder is due to a
peculiar property of the drug. It induces an acute persecution
complex in the addict who becomes prey to the illusion
that people want to kill him and that he is always being
followed with harmful intent. He will turn with his feet and
fists, or with a razor, on a stranger in the streets who he
thinks has scrutinized him offensively. Less advanced addicts
tend to avoid an old friend who has reached the one hundred
shots a day dosage, and this of course merely increases his
feeling of persecution.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘In this way murder becomes an act of self-defence,
virtuous and justified, and it will readily be seen what a dangerous
weapon it can become in the handling and direction
of organized crime by a “master-mind”.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Philopon has been traced as the motive power behind the
notorious Bar Mecca murder case and as a result of that unpleasant
affair the police rounded up more than 5000 <span class="it">purveyors</span>
of the drug in a matter of weeks.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘As usual Korean nationals are being blamed . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly Bond rebelled. What the hell was he doing reading
all this stuff? When would he conceivably require to
know about a Japanese murder-drug called Philopon?</p>

<p class="pindent">Inattentively he skimmed through the remaining pages,
ticked himself off the distribution slip, and threw the docket
into his out-tray.</p>

<p class="pindent">His headache was still sitting over his right eye as if it had
been nailed there. He opened one of the drawers of his desk
and took out a bottle of Phensic. He considered asking his
secretary for a glass of water, but he disliked being cossetted.
With distaste he crunched two tablets between his teeth
and swallowed down the harsh powder.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he lit a cigarette and got up and stood by the window.
He looked across the green panorama far below him
and, without seeing it, let his eyes wander aimlessly along
the jagged horizon of London while his mind focused on the
strange events of the night before.</p>

<p class="pindent">And the more he thought about it, the stranger it all
seemed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Why should Drax, a millionaire, a public hero, a man with
a unique position in the country, why should this remarkable
man cheat at cards? What could he achieve by it? What
could he prove to himself? Did he think that he was so much
a law unto himself, so far above the common herd and their
puny canons of behaviour that he could spit in the face of
public opinion?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s mind paused. Spit in their faces. That just about
described his manner at Blades. The combination of superiority
and scorn. As if he was dealing with human muck so
far beneath contempt that there was no need to put up even
a pretence of decent behaviour in its company.</p>

<p class="pindent">Presumably Drax enjoyed gambling. Perhaps it eased the
tensions in him, the tensions that showed in his harsh voice,
his nail-biting, the constant sweating. But he mustn’t lose. It
would be contemptible to lose to these inferior people. So, at
whatever risk, he must cheat his way to victory. As for the
possibility of detection, presumably he thought that he could
bluster his way out of any corner. If he thought about it at
all. And people with obsessions, reflected Bond, were blind to
danger. They even courted it in a perverse way. Kleptomaniacs
would try to steal more and more difficult objects.
Sex maniacs would parade their importunities as if they were
longing to be arrested. Pyromaniacs often made no attempt
to avoid being linked with their fire-raising.</p>

<p class="pindent">But what obsession was it that was consuming this man?
What was the origin of the compulsive urge that was driving
him down the steep hill into the sea?</p>

<p class="pindent">All the signs pointed to paranoia. Delusions of grandeur
and, behind that, of persecution. The contempt in his face.
The bullying voice. The expression of secret triumph with
which he had met defeat after a moment of bitter collapse.
The triumph of the maniac who knows that whatever the
facts may say he is right. Whoever may try to thwart him he
can overcome. For him there is no defeat because of his
secret power. He knows how to make gold. He can fly like a
bird. He is almighty—the man in the padded cell who is God.</p>

<p class="pindent">Yes, thought Bond, gazing blindly out over Regent’s Park.
That is the solution. Sir Hugo Drax is a raving paranoiac.
That is the power which has driven him on, by devious
routes, to make his millions. That is the mainspring of the
gift to England of this giant rocket that will annihilate our
enemies. Thanks to the all-powerful Drax.</p>

<p class="pindent">But who can tell how near to breaking-point this man is?
Who has penetrated behind that bluster, behind all that red
hair on his face, who has read the signs as more than the
effect of his humble origins or of sensitivity about his war
wounds?</p>

<p class="pindent">Apparently no one. Then was he, Bond, right in his
analysis? What was it based on? Was this glimpse through
a shuttered window into a man’s soul sufficient evidence?
Perhaps others had caught such a glimpse. Perhaps there
had been other moments of supreme tension in Singapore,
Hong Kong, Nigeria, Tangier, when some merchant sitting
across a table from Drax had noticed the sweat and the
bitten nails and the red blaze of the eyes in the face from
which all the blood had suddenly been drained.</p>

<p class="pindent">If one had time, thought Bond, one ought to seek those
people out, if they existed, and really find out about this
man, perhaps get him in the killing-bottle before it was too
late.</p>

<p class="pindent">Too late? Bond smiled to himself. What was he being so
dramatic about? What had this man done to him? Made him
a present of £15,000. Bond shrugged. It was none of his
business anyway. But that last remark of his, ‘Spend it
quickly, Commander Bond.’ What had he meant by that?
It must be those words, Bond reflected, that had stayed in the
back of his mind and made him ponder so carefully over the
problem of Drax.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned brusquely away from the window. To hell
with it, he thought. I’m getting obsessed myself. Now then.
Fifteen thousand pounds. A miraculous windfall. All right
then, he <span class="it">would</span> spend it quickly. He sat down at his desk and
picked up a pencil. He thought for a moment and then wrote
carefully on a memorandum pad headed ‘Top Secret’:</p>

<p class="pindent">(1) Rolls-Bentley Convertible, say £5000.</p>

<p class="pindent">(2) Three diamond clips at £250 each, £750.</p>

<p class="pindent">He paused. That still left nearly £10,000. Some clothes,
paint the flat, a set of the new Henry Cotton irons, a few
dozen of the Taittinger champagne. But those could wait.
He would go that afternoon and buy the clips and talk to
Bentleys. Put all the rest into gold shares. Make a fortune.
Retire.</p>

<p class="pindent">In angry protest the red telephone splintered the silence.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Can you come up? M. wants you.” It was the Chief of
Staff, speaking urgently.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Coming,” said Bond, suddenly alert. “Any clue?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Search me,” said the Chief of Staff. “Hasn’t touched his
signals yet. Been over at the Yard and the Ministry of Supply
all the morning.”</p>

<p class="pindent">He rang off.</p>
