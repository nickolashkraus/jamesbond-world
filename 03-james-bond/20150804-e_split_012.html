<p class="pindent">At six o’clock that Tuesday evening towards the end of
May, James Bond was thrashing the big Bentley down
the Dover road along the straight stretch that runs into
Maidstone.</p>

<p class="pindent">Although he was driving fast and with concentration, part
of his mind was going back over his movements since he had
left M.’s office four and a half hours earlier.</p>

<p class="pindent">After giving a brief outline of the case to his secretary
and eating a quick lunch at a table to himself in the canteen,
he had told the garage for God’s sake to hurry up with his
car and deliver it, filled up, to his flat not later than four
o’clock. Then he had taken a taxi down to Scotland Yard
where he had an appointment with Assistant Commissioner
Vallance at a quarter to three.</p>

<p class="pindent">The courtyards and cul-de-sacs of the Yard had reminded
him as usual of a prison without roofs. The overhead strip
lighting in the cold corridor took the colour out of the cheeks
of the police sergeant who asked his business and watched
him sign the apple-green chit. It did the same for the face of
the constable who led him up the short steps and along the
bleak passage between the rows of anonymous doors to the
waiting-room.</p>

<p class="pindent">A quiet, middle-aged woman with the resigned eyes of
someone who had seen everything came in and said the
Assistant Commissioner would be free in five minutes. Bond
had gone to the window and had looked out into the grey
courtyard below. A constable, looking naked without his
helmet, had come out of a building and walked across the
yard munching a split roll with something pink between the
two halves. It had been very quiet and the noise of the traffic
on Whitehall and on the Embankment had sounded far
away. Bond had felt dispirited. He was getting tangled up
with strange departments. He would be out of touch with his
own people and his own Service routines. Already, in this
waiting-room, he felt out of his element. Only criminals or
informers came and waited here, or influential people vainly
trying to get out of a dangerous driving charge or desperately
hoping to persuade Vallance that their sons were not really
homosexuals. You could not be in the waiting-room of the
Special Branch for any innocent purpose. You were either
prosecuting or defending.</p>

<p class="pindent">At last the woman came for him. He stubbed out his
cigarette in the top of the Player’s cigarette tin that serves as
an ashtray in the waiting-rooms of government departments,
and followed her across the corridor.</p>

<p class="pindent">After the gloom of the waiting-room the unseasonable fire
in the hearth of the large cheerful room had seemed like a
trick, like the cigarette offered you by the Gestapo.</p>

<p class="pindent">It had taken Bond a full five minutes to shake off his depression
and realize that Ronnie Vallance was relieved to
see him, that he was not interested in inter-departmental
jealousies and that he was only looking to Bond to protect
the Moonraker and get one of his best officers out of what
might be a bad mess.</p>

<p class="pindent">Vallance was a man of great tact. For the first few minutes
he had spoken only of M. And he had spoken with inside
knowledge and with sincerity. Without even mentioning the
case he had gained Bond’s friendship and co-operation.</p>

<p class="pindent">As Bond swung the Bentley through the crowded streets of
Maidstone he reflected that Vallance’s gift had come from
twenty years of avoiding the corns of MI5, of working in
with the uniformed branch of the police, and of handling
ignorant politicians and affronted foreign diplomats.</p>

<p class="pindent">When Bond had left him after a quarter of an hour’s hard
talking, each man knew that he had acquired an ally. Vallance
had sized up Bond and knew that Gala Brand would
get all Bond’s help and whatever protection she needed. He
also respected Bond’s professional approach to the assignment
and his absence of departmental rivalry with the
Special Branch. As for Bond, he was full of admiration for
what he had learned about Vallance’s agent, and he felt that
he was no longer naked and that he had Vallance and the
whole of Vallance’s department behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had left Scotland Yard with the feeling that he had
achieved Clausewitz’s first principle. He had made his base
secure.</p>

<p class="pindent">His visit to the Ministry of Supply had added nothing to his
knowledge of the case. He had studied Tallon’s record and
his reports. The former was quite straightforward—a lifetime
in Army Intelligence and Field Security—and the latter
painted a picture of a very lively and well-managed technical
establishment—one or two cases of drunkenness, one of petty
theft, several personal vendettas leading to fights and mild
bloodshed but otherwise a loyal and hardworking team of
men.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he had had an inadequate half-hour in the Operations
Room of the Ministry with Professor Train, a fat,
scruffy, undistinguished-looking man who had been runner-up
for the Physics Division of the Nobel Prize the year before
and who was one of the greatest experts on guided missiles in
the world.</p>

<p class="pindent">Professor Train had walked up to a row of huge wall maps
and had pulled down the cord of one of them. Bond was
faced with a ten-foot horizontal scale diagram of some thing
that looked like a V2 with big fins.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Now,” said Professor Train, “you know nothing about
rockets so I’m going to put this in simple terms and not fill
you up with a lot of stuff about Nozzle Expansion Ratios,
Exhaust Velocity, and the Keplerian Ellipse. The Moonraker,
as Drax chooses to call it, is a single-stage rocket. It
uses up all its fuel shooting itself into the air and then it
homes on to the objective. The V2’s trajectory was more like
a shell fired from a gun. At the top of its 200-mile flight it had
climbed to about 70 miles. It was fuelled with a very combustible
mixture of alcohol and liquid oxygen which was
watered down so as not to burn out the mild steel which was
all they were allocated for the engine. There are far more
powerful fuels available but until now we hadn’t been able
to achieve very much with them for the same reason, their
combustion temperature is so high that they would burn out
the toughest engine.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The professor paused and stuck a finger in Bond’s chest.
“All you, my dear sir, have to remember about this rocket is
that, thanks to Drax’s Columbite, which has a melting point
of about 3500 degrees Centigrade, compared with 1300 in
the V2 engines, we can use one of the super fuels without
burning out the engine. In fact,” he looked at Bond as if
Bond should be impressed, “we are using fluorine and hydrogen.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, really,” said Bond reverently.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Professor looked at him sharply. “So we hope to
achieve a speed in the neighbourhood of 1500 miles an hour
and a vertical range of about 1000 miles. This should produce
an operational range of about 4000 miles, bringing
every European capital within reach of England. Very useful,”
he added drily, “in certain circumstances. But, for the
scientists, chiefly desirable as a step towards escape from the
earth. Any questions?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“How does it work?” asked Bond dutifully.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Professor gestured brusquely towards the diagram.
“Let’s start from the nose,” he said. “First comes the warhead.
For the practice shoot this will contain upper-atmosphere
instruments, radar and suchlike. Then the gyro compasses
to make it fly straight—pitch-and-yaw gyro and roll
gyro. Then various minor instruments, servo motors, power
supply. And then the big fuel tanks—30,000 pounds of the
stuff.</p>

<p class="pindent">“At the stern you get two small tanks to drive the turbine.
Four hundred pounds of hydrogen peroxide mixes with
forty pounds of potassium permanganate and makes steam
which drives the turbines underneath them. These drive a
set of centrifugal pumps which force the main fuel into the
rocket motor. Under terrific pressure. Do you follow me?”
He cocked a dubious eyebrow at Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sounds much the same principle as a jet plane,” said
Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Professor seemed pleased. “More or less,” he said,
“but the rocket carries all its fuel inside it, instead of sucking
in oxygen from outside like the Comet. Well then,” he continued,
“the fuel gets ignited in the motor and squirts out at
the end in a continuous blast. Rather like a continuous recoil
from a gun. And this blast forces the rocket into the air like
any other firework. Of course it’s at the stern that the Columbite
comes in. It’s allowed us to make a motor that won’t be
melted by the fantastic heat. And then,” he pointed, “those
are the tail fins to keep it steady at the beginning of its flight.
Also made of Columbite alloy or they’d break away with the
colossal air pressure. Anything else?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“How can you be certain it’ll come down where you mean
it to?” asked Bond. “What’s to prevent it falling on The
Hague next Friday?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“The gyros will see to that. But as a matter of fact we’re
taking no chances on Friday and we’re using a radar
homing device on a raft in the middle of the sea. There’ll be
a radar transmitter in the nose of the rocket which will pick
up an echo from our gadget in the sea and home on to it
automatically. Of course,” the Professor grinned, “if we ever
had to use the thing in wartime it would be a great help to
have a homing device transmitting energy from the middle of
Moscow or Warsaw or Prague or Monte Carlo or wherever
we might be shooting at. It’ll probably be up to you chaps to
get one there. Good luck to you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled non-committally. “One more question,” he
said. “If you wanted to sabotage the rocket what would be
the easiest way?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Any number,” said the Professor cheerfully. “Sand in the
fuel. Grit in the pumps. A small hole anywhere on the fuselage
or the fins. With that power and at those speeds the
smallest fault would finish it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thanks very much,” said Bond. “It seems you’ve got
fewer worries about the Moonraker than I have.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It’s a wonderful machine,” said the Professor. “She’ll fly
all right if nobody interferes with her. Drax has done a sound
job. Wonderful organizer. That’s a brilliant team he put
together. And they’ll do anything for him. We’ve got a lot
to thank him for.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond did a racing change and swung the big car left at
the Charing fork, preferring the clear road by Chilham and
Canterbury to the bottlenecks of Ashford and Folkestone.
The car howled up to eighty in third and he held it in the
same gear to negotiate the hairpin at the top of the long
gradient leading up to the Molash road.</p>

<p class="pindent">And, he wondered, going back into top and listening with
satisfaction to the relaxed thunder of the exhaust, and what
about Drax? What sort of a reception was Drax going to
give him this evening? According to M., when his name had
been suggested over the telephone, Drax had paused for a
moment and then said, “Oh yes. I know the fellow. Didn’t
know he was mixed up in that racket. I’d be interested to
have another look at him. Send him along. I’ll expect him in
time for dinner.” Then he had rung off.</p>

<p class="pindent">The people at the Ministry had their own view of Drax.
In their dealings with him they had found him a dedicated
man, completely bound up in the Moonraker, living for
nothing but its success, driving his men to the limit, fighting
for priorities in material with other departments, goading
the Ministry of Supply into clearing his requirements at
Cabinet level. They disliked his hectoring manners but they
respected him for his know-how and his drive and his dedication.
And, like the rest of England, they considered him a
possible saviour of the country.</p>

<p class="pindent">Well, thought Bond, accelerating down the straight stretch
of road past Chilham Castle, he could see that picture too
and if he was going to work with the man he must adjust
himself to the heroic version. If Drax was willing, he would
put the whole affair at Blades out of his mind and concentrate
on protecting Drax and his wonderful project from
their country’s enemies. There were only about three days to
go. The security precautions were already minute and Drax
might resent suggestions for increasing them. It was not
going to be easy and a great deal of tact would have to be
used. Tact. Not Bond’s long suit and not, he reflected, connected
in any way with that he knew of Drax’s character.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took the short cut out of Canterbury by the Old
Dover road and looked at his watch. It was six-thirty.
Another fifteen minutes to Dover and then another ten
minutes along the Deal road. Were there any other plans to
be made? The double killing was out of his hands, thank
heaven. ‘Murder and suicide while of unsound mind’ had
been the coroner’s verdict. The girl had not even been
called. He would stop for a drink at the ‘World Without
Want’ and have a quick word with the innkeeper. The next
day he would have to try and smell out the ‘something fishy’
that Tallon had wanted to see the Minister about. No clue
about that. Nothing had been found in Tallon’s room, which
presumably he would now be taking over. Well, at any rate
that would give him plenty of leisure to go through Tallon’s
papers.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond concentrated on his driving as he coasted down into
Dover. He kept left and was soon climbing out of the town
again past the wonderful cardboard castle.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a patch of low cloud on top of the hill and a
spit of rain on his windshield. There was a cold breeze
coming in from the sea. The visibility was bad and he
switched on his lights as he motored slowly along the coast-road,
the ruby-spangled masts of the Swingate radar station
rising like petrified Roman candles on his right.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl? He would have to be careful how he contacted
her and careful not to upset her. He wondered if she would
be any use to him. After a year on the site she would have
had all the opportunities of a private secretary to ‘The
Chief’ to get under the skin of the whole project—and of
Drax. And she had a mind trained to his own particular
craft. But he would have to be prepared for her to be
suspicious of the new broom and perhaps resentful. He
wondered what she was really like. The photograph on her
record-sheet at the Yard had shown an attractive but rather
severe girl and any hint of seductiveness had been abstracted
by the cheerless jacket of her policewoman’s uniform.</p>

<p class="pindent">Hair: Auburn. Eyes: Blue. Height: 5 ft 7. Weight: 9
stone. Hips: 38. Waist: 26. Bust: 38. Distinguishing marks:
Mole on upper curvature of right breast.</p>

<p class="pindent">Hm! thought Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">He put the statistics out of his mind as he came to the turning
to the right. There was a signpost that said Kingsdown,
and the lights of a small inn.</p>

<p class="pindent">He pulled up and switched off the engine. Above his head
a sign which said ‘World Without Want’ in faded gold
lettering groaned in the salt breeze that came over the cliffs
half a mile away. He got out, stretched and walked over to
the door of the public bar. It was locked. Closed for cleaning?
He tried the next door, which opened and gave access to the
small private bar. Behind the bar a stolid-looking man in
shirt-sleeves was reading an evening paper.</p>

<p class="pindent">He looked up as Bond entered, and put his paper down.
“Evening, sir,” he said, evidently relieved to see a customer.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Evening,” said Bond. “Large whisky and soda, please.”
He sat up at the bar and waited while the man poured two
measures of Black and White and put the glass in front of
him with a syphon of soda.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond filled the glass with soda and drank. “Bad business
you had here last night,” he said, putting the glass down.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Terrible, sir,” said the man. “And bad for trade. Would
you be from the Press, sir? Had nothing but reporters and
policemen in and out of the house all day long.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No,” said Bond. “I’ve come to take over the job of the
fellow who got shot. Major Tallon. Was he one of your
regular customers?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Never came here but the once, sir, and that was the end
of him. Now I’ve been put out of bounds for a week and the
public has got to be painted from top to bottom. But I will
say that Sir Hugo has been very decent about it. Sent me fifty
quid this afternoon to pay for the damage. He must be a fine
gentleman that. Made himself well liked in these parts.
Always very generous and a cheery word for all.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes. Fine man,” said Bond. “Did you see it all happen?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Didn’t see the first shot, sir. Serving a pint at the time.
Then of course I looked up. Dropped the ruddy pint on the
floor.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What happened then?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, everybody’s standing back of course. Nothing but
Germans in the place. About a dozen of them. There’s the
body on the floor and the chap with the gun looking down
at him. Then suddenly he stands to attention and sticks his
left arm up in the air. ‘ ’Eil!’ he shouts like the silly bastards
used to do during the war. Then he puts the end of the gun
in his mouth. Next thing,” the man made a grimace, “he’s
all over my ruddy ceiling.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That was all he said after the shot?” asked Bond. “Just
‘<span class="it">Heil</span>’?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s all, sir. Don’t seem to be able to forget the bloody
word, do they?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No,” said Bond thoughtfully, “they certainly don’t.”</p>
