<p class="pindent">There were three separate sources of pain in Gala’s body.
The throbbing ache behind her left ear, the bite of the flex
at her wrists, and the chafing of the strap round her ankles.</p>

<p class="pindent">Every bump in the road, every swerve, every sudden pressure
of Drax’s foot on the brakes or the accelerator awoke
one or another of these pains and rasped at her nerves. If
only she had been wedged into the back seat more tightly.
But there was just room enough for her body to roll a few
inches on the occasional seat so that she was constantly
having to twist her bruised face away from contact with the
walls of shiny pig-skin.</p>

<p class="pindent">The air she breathed was stuffy with a smell of new leather
upholstery, exhaust fumes, and the occasional sharp stench of
burning rubber as Drax flayed the tyres on a sharp corner.</p>

<p class="pindent">And yet the discomfort and pain were nothing.</p>

<p class="pindent">Krebs! Curiously enough her fear and loathing of Krebs
tormented her most. The other things were too big. The
mystery of Drax and his hatred of England. The riddle of his
perfect command of German. The Moonraker. The secret of
the atomic warhead. How to save London. These were
matters which she had long ago put away in the back of her
mind as insoluble.</p>

<p class="pindent">But the afternoon alone with Krebs was present and dreadful
and her mind went back and back to the details of it like
a tongue to an aching tooth.</p>

<p class="pindent">Long after Drax had gone she had kept up her pretence
of unconsciousness. At first Krebs had occupied himself with
the machines, talking to them in German in a cooing baby-talk.
“There, my <span class="it">Liebchen</span>. That’s better now, isn’t it? A
drop of oil for you, my <span class="it">Pupperl</span>? But certainly. Coming up
at once. No, no, lazybones. I said a thousand revolutions.
Not nine hundred. Come along now. We can do better than
that, can’t we. Yes, my <span class="it">Schatz</span>. That’s it. Round and round
we go. Up and down. Round and round. Let me wipe your
pretty face for you so that we can see what the little dial is
saying. <span class="it">Jesu Maria, bist du ein braves Kind!</span>”</p>

<p class="pindent">And so it had gone on with intervals of standing in front
of Gala, picking his nose and sucking his teeth in a horribly
ruminative way. Until he stayed longer and longer in front
of her, forgetting the machines, wondering, making up his
mind.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then she had felt his hand undo the top button of her
dress and the automatic recoil of her body had had to be
covered by a realistic groan and a pantomime of consciousness
returning.</p>

<p class="pindent">She had asked for water and he had gone into a bathroom
and fetched some for her in a toothglass. Then he had pulled
a kitchen chair up in front of her and had sat down astride it,
his chin resting on the top rail of its back, and had gazed at
her speculatively from under his pale drooping lids.</p>

<p class="pindent">She had been the first to break the silence. “Why have
I been brought here?” she asked. “What are all those
machines?”</p>

<p class="pindent">He licked his lips and the little pouting red mouth opened
under the smudge of yellow moustache and formed itself
slowly into a rhomboid-shaped smile. “That is a lure for little
birds,” he said. “Soon it will lure a little bird into this warm
nest. Then the little bird will lay an egg. Oh, such a big round
egg! Such a beautiful fat egg.” The lower half of his face
giggled with delight while his eyes mooned. “And the pretty
girl is here because otherwise she might frighten the little bird
away. And that would be so sad, wouldn’t it,” he spat out the
next three words, “filthy English bitch?”</p>

<p class="pindent">His eyes became intent and purposeful. He hitched his
chair nearer so that his face was only a foot away from hers
and she was enveloped in the miasma of his breath. “Now,
English bitch. Who are you working for?” He waited. “You
must answer me, you know,” he said softly. “We are all alone
here. There is no one to hear you scream.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’t be stupid,” said Gala desperately. “How could I
be working for anyone except Sir Hugo?” (Krebs smiled at
the name.) “I was just curious about the flight plan . . .” she
went into a rambling explanation about her figures and
Drax’s figures and how she had wanted to share in the
success of the Moonraker.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Try again,” whispered Krebs when she had finished.
“You must do better than that,” and suddenly his eyes had
turned hot with cruelty and his hands had reached towards
her from behind the back of his chair . . .</p>

<p class="pindent">In the rear of the hurtling Mercedes Gala ground her teeth
together and whimpered at the memory of the soft crawling
fingers on her body, probing, pinching, pulling, while all the
time the hot vacant eyes gazed curiously into hers until
finally she gathered the saliva in her mouth and spat full in
his face.</p>

<p class="pindent">He hadn’t even paused to wipe his face, but suddenly he
had really hurt her and she had screamed once and then
mercifully fainted.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then she had found herself being pushed into the
back of the car, a rug was thrown over her, and they were
hurtling through the streets of London and she could hear
other cars near them, the frantic ringing of a bicycle bell,
an occasional shout, the animal growl of an old klaxon, the
whirring putter of a motor-scooter, a scream of brakes, and
she had realized that she was back in the real world, that
English people, friends, were all around her. She had
struggled to get to her knees and scream, but Krebs must
have felt her movement because his hands were suddenly at
her ankles, strapping them to the foot-rail along the floor,
and she knew that she was lost and suddenly the tears were
pouring down her cheeks and she was praying that somehow,
somebody would be in time.</p>

<p class="pindent">That had been less than an hour ago and now she could
tell from the slow pace of the car and the noise of other
traffic that they had reached a large town—Maidstone if she
was being taken back to the site.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the comparative silence of their progress through the
town she suddenly heard Krebs’s voice. There was a note of
urgency in it.</p>

<p class="pindent">“<span class="it">Mein Kapitän</span>,” he said. “I have been watching a car for
some time. It is certainly following us. It has seldom been
using its lights. It is only a hundred metres behind us now.
I think it is the car of Commander Bond.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax grunted with surprise and she could hear his big
body shift round to get a quick look.</p>

<p class="pindent">He swore sharply and then there was silence and she could
feel the big car weaving and straining in the thin traffic.
“<span class="it">Ja, sowas!</span>” said Drax finally. His voice was thoughtful. “So
that old museum-piece of his can still move. So much the
better, my dear Krebs. He seems to be alone.” He laughed
harshly. “So we will give him a run for his money and if he
survives it we will get him in the bag with the woman. Turn
on the radio. Home Service. We will soon find out if there is
a hitch.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a short crackle of static and then Gala could
hear the voice of the Prime Minister, the voice of all the great
occasions in her life, coming through in broken fragments
as Drax put the car into third and accelerated out of the
town, ‘. . . weapon devised by the ingenuity of man . . . a
thousand miles into the firmament . . . area patrolled by Her
Majesty’s ships . . . designed exclusively for the defence of
our beloved island . . . a long era of peace . . . development
for Man’s great journey away from the confines of this planet
. . . Sir Hugo Drax, that great patriot and benefactor of our
country . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala heard Drax’s roar of laughter above the howling of
the wind, a great scornful bray of triumph, and then the set
was switched off.</p>

<p class="pindent">“James,” whispered Gala to herself. “There’s only you left.
Be careful. But make haste.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s face was a mask of dust and filthy with the blood
of flies and moths that had smashed against it. Often he had
had to take a cramped hand off the wheel to clear his goggles
but the Bentley was going beautifully and he felt sure of
holding the Mercedes.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was touching ninety-five on the straight just before
the entrance to Leeds Castle when great lights were suddenly
switched on behind him and a four-tone windhorn sounded
its impudent ‘pom-pim-pom-pam’ almost in his ear.</p>

<p class="pindent">The apparition of a third car in the race was almost unbelievable.
Bond had hardly troubled to look in his driving-mirror
since he left London. No one but a racing-driver or a
desperate man could have kept up with them, and his mind
was in a turmoil as he automatically pulled over to the left
and saw out of the corner of his eye a low, fire-engine-red
car come up level with him and draw away with a good ten
miles an hour extra on its clock.</p>

<p class="pindent">He caught a glimpse of the famous Alfa radiator and along
the edge of the bonnet in bold white script the words <span class="it">Attaboy
II</span>. Then there was the grinning face of a youth in shirt-sleeves
who stuck two rude fingers in the air before he pulled
away in the welter of sound which an Alfa at speed compounds
from the whine of its supercharger, the Gatling
crackle of its exhaust, and the thunderous howl of its transmission.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond grinned in admiration as he raised a hand to the
driver. Alfa-Romeo supercharged straight-eight, he thought
to himself. Must be nearly as old as mine. ’Thirty-two or ’33
probably. And only half my c.c. Targa Florio in 1931 and
did well everywhere after that. Probably a hot-rod type from
one of the RAF stations round here. Trying to get back from
a party in time to sign in before he’s put on the report. He
watched affectionately as the Alfa wagged its tail in the
S-bend abreast of Leeds Castle and then howled off on the
long wide road towards the distant Charing-fork.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond could imagine the grin of delight as the boy came
up with Drax. ‘Oh, boy. It’s a Merc!’ And the rage of Drax
at the impudent music of the windhorn. Must be doing 105,
reflected Bond. Hope the damn fool doesn’t run out of road.
He watched the two sets of tail lights closing up, the boy in
the Alfa preparing for his trick of coming up behind and
suddenly switching everything on when he could see a chance
to get by.</p>

<p class="pindent">There. Four hundred yards away the Mercedes showed
white in the sudden twin shafts from the Alfa. There was a
mile of clear road ahead, straight as a die. Bond could almost
feel the boy’s feet stamping the pedal still further into the
floorboards. Attaboy!</p>

<p class="pindent">Up front in the Mercedes Krebs had his mouth close to
Drax’s ear. “Another of them,” he shouted urgently. “Can’t
see his face. Coming up to pass now.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax let out a harsh obscenity. His bared teeth showed
white in the pale glimmer from the dashboard. “Teach the
swine a lesson,” he said, setting his shoulders and gripping
the wheel tightly in the great leather gauntlets. Out of the
corner of his eye he watched the nose of the Alfa creep up
to starboard. ‘Pom-pim-pom-pam’ chirped the windhorn,
softly, delicately, Drax inched the wheel of the Mercedes to
the right and, at the horrible crash of metal, whipped it back
again to correct the slew of his tail.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Bravo! Bravo!” screamed Krebs, beside himself with
excitement as he knelt on the seat and looked back. “Double
somersault. Jumped the hedge upside down. I think he’s
burning already. Yes. There are flames.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’ll give our fine Mister Bond something to think
about,” snarled Drax, breathing heavily.</p>

<p class="pindent">But Bond, his face a tight mask, had hardly checked his
speed and there was nothing but revenge in his mind as he
hurtled on after the flying Mercedes.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had seen it all. The grotesque flight of the red car as it
turned over and over, the flying figure of the driver, his arms
and legs spreadeagled as he soared out of the driving seat,
and the final thunder as the car hurdled the hedge upside
down and crashed into the field.</p>

<p class="pindent">As he flashed by, noting the horrible graffiti of the black
skid-marks across the tarmac, his mind recorded one final
macabre touch. Somehow undamaged in the holocaust, the
windhorn was still making contact and its ululations were
going on up to the sky, stridently clearing imaginary roads
for the passage of <span class="it">Attaboy II</span>—‘Pom-pim-pom-pam.’ ‘Pom-pim-pom-pam
. . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">So a murder had taken place in front of his eyes. Or at
any rate an attempted murder. So, whatever his motives, Sir
Hugo Drax had declared war and didn’t mind Bond knowing
it. This made a lot of things easier. It meant that Drax was
a criminal and probably a maniac. Above all it meant certain
danger for the Moonraker. That was enough for Bond.
He reached under the dashboard and from its concealed
holster drew out the long-barrelled ·45 Colt Army Special
and laid it on the seat beside him. The battle was now in the
open and somehow the Mercedes must be stopped.</p>

<p class="pindent">Using the road as if it was Donington, Bond rammed his
foot down and kept it there. Gradually, with the needle
twitching either side of the hundred mark he began to
narrow the gap.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax took the left-hand fork at Charing and hissed up the
long hill. Ahead, in the giant beam of his headlights, one of
Bowaters’ huge eight-wheeled AEC Diesel carriers was just
grinding into the first bend of the hairpin, labouring under
the fourteen tons of newsprint it was taking on a night run
to one of the East Kent newspapers.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax cursed under his breath as he saw the long carrier
with the twenty gigantic rolls, each containing five miles of
newsprint, roped to its platform. Right in the middle of the
tricky S-bend at the top of the hill.</p>

<p class="pindent">He looked in the driving mirror and saw the Bentley
coming into the fork.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then Drax had his idea.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Krebs,” the word was a pistol shot. “Get out your knife.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a sharp click and the stiletto was in Krebs’s
hand. One didn’t dawdle when there was that note in the
master’s voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I am going to slow down behind this lorry. Take your
shoes and socks off and climb out on to the bonnet and when
I come up behind the lorry jump on to it. I shall be going at
walking-pace. It will be safe. Cut the ropes that hold the rolls
of paper. The left ones first. Then the right. I shall have
pulled up level with the lorry and when you have cut the
second lot jump into the car. Be careful you are not swept off
with the paper. <span class="it">Verstanden? Also. Hals und Beinbruch!</span>”</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax dowsed his headlights and swept round the bend at
eighty. The lorry was twenty yards ahead and Drax had to
brake hard to avoid crashing into its tail. The Mercedes
executed a dry skid until its radiator was almost underneath
the platform of the carrier.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax changed down to second. “Now!” He held the car
steady as a rock as Krebs, with bare feet, went over the
windscreen and scrambled along the shining bonnet, his knife
in his hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">With a leap he was up and hacking at the left-hand ropes.
Drax pulled away to the right and crawled up level with the
rear wheels of the Diesel, the oily smoke from its exhaust in
his eyes and nostrils.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s lights were just showing round the bend.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a series of huge thuds as the left-hand rolls
poured off the back of the lorry into the road and went
hurtling off into the darkness. And more thuds as the right-hand
ropes parted. One roll burst as it landed and Drax
heard a tearing rattle as the unwinding paper crashed back
down the one-in-ten gradient.</p>

<p class="pindent">Released of its load the lorry almost bounded forward and
Drax had to accelerate a little to catch the flying figure of
Krebs who landed half across Gala’s back and half in the
front seat. Drax stamped his foot into the floor and sped off
up the hill, ignoring a shout from the lorry-driver above the
clatter of the Diesel pistons as he shot ahead.</p>

<p class="pindent">As he hurtled round the next bend he saw the shaft of two
headlights curve up into the sky above the tops of the trees
until they were almost vertical. They wavered there for an
instant and then the beams whirled away across the sky and
went out.</p>

<p class="pindent">A great barking laugh broke out of Drax as for a split
second he took his eyes off the road and raised his face
triumphantly towards the stars.</p>
