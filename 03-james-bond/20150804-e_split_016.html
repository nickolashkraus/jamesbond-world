<p class="pindent">Half an hour before, Gala Brand had stubbed out her
breakfast cigarette, swallowed the remains of her coffee,
left her bedroom and walked across to the site, looking very
much the private secretary in a spotless white shirt and dark
blue pleated skirt.</p>

<p class="pindent">Punctually at eight-thirty she was in her office. There was
a sheaf of Air Ministry teleprints on her desk and her first
action was to transfer a digest of their contents on to a
weather map and walk through the communicating door
into Drax’s office and pin the map to the board that hung
in the angle of the wall beside the blank glass wall. Then she
pressed the switch that illuminated the wall map, made some
calculations based on the columns of figures revealed by the
light, and entered the results on the diagram she had pinned
to the board.</p>

<p class="pindent">She had done this, with Air Ministry figures that became
more and more precise as the practice shoot drew nearer,
every day since the site was completed and the building of the
rocket that had begun inside it, and she had become so expert
that she now carried in her head the gyro settings for almost
every variation in the weather at the different altitudes.</p>

<p class="pindent">So it irritated her all the more that Drax did not seem to
accept her figures. Every day when, punctually at nine, the
warning bells clanged and he came down the steep iron stairway
and into his office, his first action was to call for the insufferable
Dr Walter and together they would work out all
her figures afresh and transfer the results to the thin black
notebook that Drax always carried in the hip pocket of his
trousers. She knew that this was an invariable routine and
she had become tired of watching it through an inconspicuous
hole she had drilled, so as to be able to send Vallance
a weekly record of Drax’s visitors, in the thin wall between
the two offices. The method was amateurish but effective and
she had slowly built up a complete picture of the daily routine
she came to find so irritating. It was irritating for two reasons.
It meant that Drax didn’t trust her figures, and it undermined
her chance of having some part, however modest, in
the final launching of the rocket.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was natural that over the months she should have become
as immersed in her disguise as she was in her real
profession. It was fundamental to the thoroughness of her
cover that her personality should be as truly split as possible.
And now, while she spied and probed and sniffed the wind
around Drax for her Chief in London, she was passionately
concerned with the success of the Moonraker and had become
as dedicated to its service as anyone else on the site.</p>

<p class="pindent">And the rest of her duties as Drax’s private secretary
were insufferably dull. Every day there was a big post
addressed to Drax in London and forwarded down by the
Ministry, and that morning she had found the usual batch
of about fifty letters waiting on her desk. They would be of
three kinds. Begging letters, letters from rocket cranks, and
business letters from Drax’s stockbroker and from other commercial
agents. To these Drax would dictate brief replies and
the rest of her day would be occupied with typing and filing.</p>

<p class="pindent">So it was natural that her one duty connected with the
operation of the rocket should bulk very large in the dull
round, and that morning, as she checked and rechecked her
flight-plan, she was more than ever determined that her
figures should be accepted on The Day. And yet, as she often
reminded herself, perhaps there was no question but that
they would be. Perhaps the daily calculations of Drax and
Walter for entry in the little black book were nothing but a
recheck of her own figures. Certainly Drax had never queried
either her weather plan or the gyro settings she calculated
from them. And when one day she had asked straight out
whether her figures were correct he had replied with evident
sincerity, “Excellent, my dear. Most valuable. Couldn’t
manage without them.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala Brand walked back into her own office and started
slitting open the letters. Only two more flight plans, for
Thursday and Friday and then, on her figures or on a different
set, the set in Drax’s pocket, the gyros would be finally
adjusted and the switch would be pulled in the firing point.</p>

<p class="pindent">She absentmindedly looked at her finger-nails and then
stretched her two hands out with their backs towards her.
How often in the course of her training at the Police College
had she been sent out among the other pupils and told not to
come back without a pocketbook, a vanity case, a fountain
pen, even a wristwatch? How often during the courses had
the instructor whipped round and caught her wrist with a
‘Now, now, Miss. That won’t do at all. Might have been an
elephant looking for sugar in the keeper’s pocket. Try again.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Coolly she flexed her fingers and then, her mind made up,
turned back to the pile of letters.</p>

<p class="pindent">At a few minutes to nine the alarm bells rang and she
heard Drax arrive in the office. A moment later she heard
him open the double doors again and call for Walter. Then
came the usual mumble of voices whose words were drowned
by the soft whirr of the ventilators.</p>

<p class="pindent">She arranged the letters in their three piles and sat forward
relaxed, her elbows resting on the desk and her chin in her
left hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">Commander Bond. James Bond. Clearly a conceited young
man like so many of them in the Secret Service. And why
had he been sent down instead of somebody she could work
with, one of her friends from the Special Branch, or even
somebody from MI5? The message from the Assistant Commissioner
had said that there was no one else available at
short notice, that this was one of the stars of the Secret Service
who had the complete confidence of the Special Branch
and the blessings of MI5. Even the Prime Minister had had
to give permission for him to operate, for just this one assignment,
inside England. But what use could he be in the short
time that was left? He could probably shoot all right and
talk foreign languages and do a lot of tricks that might be
useful abroad. But what good could he do down here without
any beautiful spies to make love to. Because he was certainly
good-looking. (Gala Brand automatically reached into her
bag for her vanity case. She examined herself in the little
mirror and dabbed at her nose with a powder puff.) Rather
like Hoagy Carmichael in a way. That black hair falling
down over the right eyebrow. Much the same bones. But
there was something a bit cruel in the mouth, and the eyes
were cold. Were they grey or blue? It had been difficult to
say last night. Well, at any rate she had put him in his place
and shown him that she wasn’t impressed by dashing young
men from the Secret Service, however romantic they might
look. There were just as good-looking men in the Special
Branch, and they were real detectives, not just people that
Phillips Oppenheim had dreamed up with fast cars and
special cigarettes with gold bands on them and shoulder-holsters.
Oh, she had spotted that all right and had even
brushed against him to make sure. Ah well, she supposed she
would have to make some sort of show of working along with
him, though in what direction heaven only knew. If she had
been down there ever since the place had been built without
spotting anything, what could this Bond man hope to discover
in a couple of days? And what was there to find out?
Of course there were one or two things she couldn’t understand.
Should she tell him about Krebs, for instance? The
first thing was to see that he didn’t blow her cover by doing
something stupid. She would have to be cool and firm and
extremely careful. But that didn’t mean, she decided, as the
buzzer went and she collected her letters and her shorthand
book, that she couldn’t be friendly. Entirely on her own
terms, of course.</p>

<p class="pindent">Her second decision made, she opened the communicating
door and walked into the office of Sir Hugo Drax.</p>

<p class="pindent">When she came back into her room half an hour later
she found Bond sitting back in her chair with <span class="it">Whitaker’s
Almanack</span> open on the desk in front of him. She pursed her
lips as Bond got up and wished her a cheerful good morning.
She nodded briefly and walked round her desk and sat down.
She moved the <span class="it">Whitaker’s</span> carefully aside and put her letters
and notebook in its place.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You might have a spare chair for visitors,” said Bond
with a grin which she defined as impertinent, “and something
better to read than reference books.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She ignored him. “Sir Hugo wants you,” said. “I was just
going to see if you had got up yet.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Liar,” said Bond. “You heard me go by at half-past seven.
I saw you peering out between the curtains.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I did nothing of the sort,” she said indignantly. “Why
should I be interested in a car going by?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I told you you heard the car,” said Bond. He pressed
home his advantage. “And by the way,” he said, “you
shouldn’t scratch your head with the blunt end of the pencil
when you’re taking dictation. None of the best private secretaries
do.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond glanced significantly at a point against the jamb of
the communicating door. He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala’s defences dropped. Damn the man, she thought.
She gave him a reluctant smile. “Oh, well,” she said. “Come
on. I can’t spend all the morning playing guessing games.
He wants both of us and he doesn’t like being kept waiting.”
She rose and walked over to the communicating door and
opened it. Bond followed her through and shut the door
behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax was standing looking at the illuminated wall map.
He turned as they came in. “Ah, there you are,” he said with
a sharp glance at Bond. “Thought you might have left us.
Guards reported you out at seven-thirty this morning.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I had to make a telephone call,” said Bond. “I hope I
didn’t disturb anyone.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“There’s a telephone in my study,” Drax said curtly.
“Tallon found it good enough.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Ah, poor Tallon,” said Bond non-committally. There was
a hectoring note in Drax’s voice that he particularly disliked
and that made him instinctively want to deflate the man. On
this occasion he was successful.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax shot him a hard glance which he covered up with a
short barking laugh and a shrug of the shoulders. “Do as you
please,” he said. “You’ve got your job to do. So long as you
don’t upset the routines down here. You must remember,”
he added more reasonably, “all my men are nervous as
kittens just now and I can’t have them upset by mysterious
goings-on. I hope you’re not wanting to ask them a lot of
questions today. I’d rather they didn’t have anything more to
worry about. They haven’t recovered from Monday yet. Miss
Brand here can tell you all about them, and I believe all their
files are in Tallon’s room. Have you had a look at them yet?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No key to the filing cabinet,” said Bond truthfully.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sorry, my fault,” said Drax. He went to the desk and
opened a drawer from which he took a small bunch of keys
and handed them to Bond. “Should have given you these last
night. The Inspector chap on the case asked me to hand
them over to you. Sorry.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thanks very much,” said Bond. He paused, “By the way,
how long have you had Krebs?” He asked the question on an
impulse. There was a moment’s quiet in the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Krebs?” repeated Drax thoughtfully. He walked over to
his desk and sat down. He reached into his trouser pocket and
pulled out a packet of his cork-tipped cigarettes. His blunt
fingers scrabbled with its cellophane wrapping. He extracted
a cigarette and stuffed it into his mouth under the fringe of
his reddish moustache and lit it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was surprised. “I didn’t realize one could smoke
down here,” he said, taking out his own case.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax’s cigarette, a tiny white faggot in the middle of the
big red face, waggled up and down as he answered without
taking it out of his mouth. “Quite all right in here,” he said.
“These rooms are air-tight. Doors lined with rubber. Separate
ventilation. Have to keep the workshops and generators
separate from the shaft and anyway,” his lips grinned round
the cigarette, “I have to be able to smoke.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax took the cigarette out of his mouth and looked at it. He
seemed to make up his mind. “You were asking about Krebs,”
he said. “Well,” he looked meaningly up at Bond, “just
between ourselves I don’t entirely trust the fellow.” He held
up an admonitory hand. “Nothing definite, of course, or I’d
have had him put away, but I’ve found him snooping about
the house and once I caught him in my study going through
my private papers. He had a perfectly good explanation and
I let him off with a warning. But quite honestly I have my
suspicions of the man. Of course, he can’t do any harm. He’s
part of the household staff and none of them are allowed in
here but,” he looked candidly into Bond’s eyes, “I would
have said you ought to concentrate on him. Bright of you to
have bowled him out so quickly,” he added with respect.
“What put you on to him?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, nothing much,” said Bond. “He’s got a shifty look.
But what you say’s interesting and I’ll certainly keep an eye
on him.”</p>

<p class="pindent">He turned to Gala Brand who had remained silent ever
since they had entered the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">“And what do you think of Krebs, Miss Brand?” he asked
politely.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl spoke to Drax. “I don’t know much about these
things, Sir Hugo,” she said with a modesty and a touch of
impulsiveness which Bond admired. “But I don’t trust the
man at all. I hadn’t meant to tell you, but he’s been poking
around my room, opening letters and so forth. I know he
has.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax was shocked. “Has he indeed?” he said. He bashed
his cigarette out in the ashtray and killed the glowing fragments
one by one. “So much for Krebs,” he said, without
looking up.</p>
