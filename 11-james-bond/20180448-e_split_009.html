<p class="line7"><span class="sc"><span class="gesp">The Union</span></span> Corse! Now at least some of the mystery was
explained. Bond looked across the desk into the brown eyes
that were now shrewdly watching his reactions while his mind
flicked through the file that bore the innocent title, ‘The
Union Corse’, more deadly and perhaps even older than the
Unione Siciliano, the Mafia. He knew that it controlled most
organized crime throughout metropolitan France and her
colonies—protection rackets, smuggling, prostitution and the
suppression of rival gangs. Only a few months ago a certain
Rossi had been shot dead in a bar in Nice. A year before that,
a Jean Giudicelli had been liquidated after several previous
attempts had failed. Both these men had been known pretenders
to the throne of Capu—the ebullient, cheerful man
who now sat so peacefully across the table from Bond. Then
there was this mysterious business of Rommel’s treasure,
supposed to be hidden beneath the sea somewhere off Bastia.
In 1948 a Czech diver called Fleigh, who had been in the
Abwehr, and had got on the track of it, was warned off by the
Union and then vanished off the face of the earth. Quite
recently the body of a young French diver, André Mattei,
was found riddled with bullets by the roadside near Bastia.
He had foolishly boasted in the local bars that he knew the
whereabouts of the treasure and had come to dive for it. Did
Marc-Ange know the secret of this treasure? Had he been
responsible for the killing of these two divers? The little village
of Calenzana in the Balagne boasted of having produced more
gangsters than any other village in Corsica and of being in
consequence one of the most prosperous. The local mayor
had held office for fifty-six years—the longest reigning mayor
in France. Marc-Ange would surely be a son of that little
community, know the secrets of that famous mayor, know,
for instance, of that big American gangster who had just
returned to discreet retirement in the village after a highly
profitable career in the States.</p>

<p class="pindent">It would be fun to drop some of these names casually in
this quiet little room—fun to tell Marc-Ange that Bond knew
of the old abandoned jetty called the Port of Crovani near the
village of Galeria, and of the ancient silver mine called
Argentella in the hills behind, whose maze of underground
tunnels accommodates one of the great world junctions in
the heroin traffic. Yes, it would be fun to frighten his captor
in exchange for the fright he had given Bond. But better
keep this ammunition in reserve until more had been revealed!
For the time being it was interesting to note that this
was Marc-Ange Draco’s travelling headquarters. His contact
in the Deuxième Bureau would be an essential tip-off man.
Bond and the girl had been ‘sent for’ for some purpose that
was still to be announced. The ‘borrowing’ of the Bombard
rescue-boat would have been a simple matter of finance in the
right quarter, perhaps accompanied by a ‘pot de vin’ for the
coastguards to look the other way. The guards were Corsicans.
On reflection, that was anyway what they looked like. The
whole operation was simple for an organization as powerful
as the Union—as simple in France as it would have been for
the Mafia in most of Italy. And now for more veils to be
lifted! James Bond sipped his drink and watched the other
man’s face with respect. This was one of the great professionals
of the world!</p>

<p class="pindent">(How typical of Corsica, Bond thought, that their top
bandit should bear the name of an angel! He remembered
that two other famous Corsican gangsters had been called
‘Gracieux’ and ‘Toussaint’—‘All-Saints’.) Marc-Ange
spoke. He spoke excellent but occasionally rather clumsy
English, as if he had been well taught but had little occasion
to use the language. He said, ‘My dear Commander,
everything I am going to discuss with you will please
remain behind your Herkos Odonton. You know the expression?
No?’ The wide smile lit up his face. ‘Then, if I
may say so, your education was incomplete. It is from the
classical Greek. It means literally “the hedge of the teeth”.
It was the Greek equivalent of your “top secret”. Is that
agreed?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shrugged. ‘If you tell me secrets that affect my profession,
I’m afraid I shall have to pass them on.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That I fully comprehend. What I wish to discuss is a
personal matter. It concerns my daughter, Teresa.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Good God! The plot was indeed thickening! Bond concealed
his surprise. He said, ‘Then I agree.’ He smiled.
‘ “Herkos Odonton” it is.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thank you. You are a man to trust. You would have to
be, in your profession, but I see it also in your face. Now then.’
He lit a Caporal and sat back in his chair. He gazed at a point
on the aluminium wall above Bond’s head, only occasionally
looking into Bond’s eyes when he wished to emphasize a
point. ‘I was married once only, to an English girl, an
English governess. She was a romantic. She had come to
Corsica to look for bandits’—he smiled—‘rather like some
English women adventure into the desert to look for sheiks.
She explained to me later that she must have been possessed
by a subconscious desire to be raped. Well’—this time he
didn’t smile—‘she found me in the mountains and she was
raped—by me. The police were after me at the time, they
have been for most of my life, and the girl was a grave encumbrance.
But for some reason she refused to leave me.
There was a wildness in her, a love of the unconventional,
and, for God knows what reason, she liked the months of
being chased from cave to cave, of getting food by robbery
at night. She even learned to skin and cook a moufflon, those
are our mountain sheep, and even eat the animal, which is
tough as shoe leather and about as palatable. And in those
crazy months, I came to love this girl and I smuggled her
away from the island to Marseilles and married her.’ He
paused and looked at Bond. ‘The result, my dear Commander,
was Teresa, my only child.’</p>

<p class="pindent">So, thought Bond. That explained the curious mixture the
girl was—the kind of wild ‘lady’ that was so puzzling in her.
What a complex of bloods and temperaments! Corsican English.
No wonder he hadn’t been able to define her nationality.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My wife died ten years ago’—Marc-Ange held up his
hand, not wanting sympathy—‘and I had the girl’s education
finished in Switzerland. I was already rich and at that time
I was elected Capu, that is chief, of the Union, and became
infinitely richer—by means, my dear Commander, which
you can guess but need not inquire into. The girl was—how
do you say?—that charming expression, “the apple of my
eye”, and I gave her all she wanted. But she was a wild one,
a wild bird, without a proper home, or, since I was always on
the move, without proper supervision. Through her school in
Switzerland, she entered the fast international set that one
reads of in the newspapers—the South American millionaires,
the Indian princelings, the Paris English and Americans, the
playboys of Cannes and Gstaad. She was always getting in
and out of scrapes and scandals, and when I remonstrated
with her, cut off her allowance, she would commit some even
grosser folly—to spite me, I suppose.’ He paused and looked
at Bond and now there was a terrible misery in the happy face.
‘And yet all the while, behind her bravado, the mother’s side
of her blood was making her hate herself, despise herself
more and more, and as I now see it, the worm of self-destruction
had somehow got a hold inside her and, behind the wild,
playgirl façade, was eating away what I can only describe as
her soul.’ He looked at Bond. ‘You know that this can happen,
my friend—to men and to women. They burn the heart out
of themselves by living too greedily, and suddenly they
examine their lives and see that they are worthless. They have
had everything, eaten all the sweets of life at one great
banquet, and there is nothing left. She made what I now see
was a desperate attempt to get back on the rails, so to speak.
She went off, without telling me, and married, perhaps with
the idea of settling down. But the man, a worthless Italian
called Vicenzo, Count Giulio di Vicenzo, took as much of
her money as he could lay his hands on and deserted her,
leaving her with a girl child. I purchased a divorce and bought
a small château for my daughter in the Dordogne and installed
her there, and for once, with the baby and a pretty
garden to look after, she seemed almost at peace. And then,
my friend, six months ago, the baby died—died of that most
terrible of all children’s ailments, spinal meningitis.’</p>

<p class="pindent">There was silence in the little metal room. Bond thought
of the girl a few yards away down the corridor. Yes. He had
been near the truth. He had seen some of this tragic story
in the calm desperation of the girl. She had indeed come to
the end of the road!</p>

<p class="pindent">Marc-Ange got slowly up from his chair and came round
and poured out more whisky for himself and for Bond. He
said, ‘Forgive me. I am a poor host. But the telling of this
story, which I have always kept locked up inside me, to
another man, has been a great relief.’ He put a hand on
Bond’s shoulder. ‘You understand that?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes. I understand that. But she is a fine girl. She still has
nearly all her life to live. Have you thought of psychoanalysis?
Of her church? Is she a Catholic?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No. Her mother would not have it. She is Presbyterian.
But wait while I finish the story.’ He went back to his chair
and sat down heavily. ‘After the tragedy, she disappeared.
She took her jewels and went off in that little car of hers, and
I heard occasional news of her, selling the jewels and living
furiously all over Europe, with her old set. Naturally I
followed her, had her watched when I could, but she avoided
all my attempts to meet her and talk to her. Then I heard
from one of my agents that she had reserved a room here, at
the Splendide, for last night, and I hurried down from Paris’—he
waved a hand—‘in this, because I had a presentiment of
tragedy. You see, this was where we had spent the summers
in her childhood and she had always loved it. She is a wonderful
swimmer and she was almost literally in love with the
sea. And, when I got the news, I suddenly had a dreadful
memory, the memory of a day when she had been naughty
and had been locked in her room all afternoon instead of
going bathing. That night she had said to her mother, quite
calmly, “You made me very unhappy keeping me away from
the sea. One day, if I get really unhappy I shall swim out into
the sea, down the path of the moon or the sun, and go on
swimming until I sink. So there!” Her mother told me the
story and we laughed over it together, at the childish tantrum.
But now I suddenly remembered again the occasion
and it seemed to me that the childish fantasy might well have
stayed with her, locked away deep down, and that now,
wanting to put an end to herself, she had resurrected it and
was going to act on it. And so, my dear friend, I had her
closely watched from the moment she arrived. Your gentlemanly
conduct in the casino, for which’—he looked across at
Bond—‘I now deeply thank you, was reported to me, as of
course were your later movements together.’ He held up
his hand as Bond shifted with embarrassment. ‘There is
nothing to be ashamed of, to apologize for, in what you did
last night. A man is a man and, who knows?—but I shall
come to that later. What you did, the way you behaved
in general, may have been the beginning of some kind of
therapy.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond remembered how, in the Bombard, she had yielded
when he leaned against her. It had been a tiny reaction, but
it had held more affection, more warmth, than all the physical
ecstasies of the night. Now, suddenly he had an inkling of
why he might be here, where the root of the mystery lay, and
he gave an involuntary shudder, as if someone had walked
over his grave.</p>

<p class="pindent">Marc-Ange continued, ‘So I put in my inquiry to my
friend from the Deuxième, at six o’clock this morning. At
eight o’clock he went to his office and to the central files and
by nine o’clock he had reported to me fully about you—by
radio. I have a high-powered station in this vehicle.’ He
smiled. ‘And that is another of my secrets that I deliver into
your hands. The report, if I may say so, was entirely to your
credit, both as an officer in your Service, and, more important,
as a man—a man, that is, in the terms that I understand the
word. So I reflected. I reflected all through this morning.
And, in the end, I gave orders that you were both to be
brought to me here.’ He made a throw-away gesture with
his right hand. ‘I need not tell you the details of my instructions.
You yourself saw them in operation. You have been
inconvenienced. I apologize. You have perhaps thought
yourself in danger. Forgive me. I only trust that my men
behaved with correctness, with finesse.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled. ‘I am very glad to have met you. If the
introduction had to be effected at the point of two automatics,
that will only make it all the more memorable. The whole
affair was certainly executed with neatness and expedition.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Marc-Ange’s expression was rueful. ‘Now you are being
sarcastic. But believe me, my friend, drastic measures were
necessary. I knew they were.’ He reached to the top drawer
of his desk, took out a sheet of writing-paper and passed it
over to Bond. ‘And now, if you read that, you will agree with
me. That letter was handed in to the concierge of the Splendide
at 4.30 this afternoon for posting to me in Marseilles,
when Teresa went out and you followed her. You suspected
something? You also feared for her? Read it, please.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took the letter. He said, ‘Yes. I was worried about
her. She is a girl worth worrying about.’ He held up the
letter. It contained only a few words, written clearly, with
decision.</p>

<div class="blockquote-right90percent">

<p class="line7">Dear Papa,</p>

<p class="pindent">I am sorry, but I have had enough. It is only sad because
tonight I met a man who might have changed my mind.
He is an Englishman called James Bond. Please find him
and pay him 20,000 New Francs which I owe him. And
thank him from me.</p>

<p class="pindent">This is nobody’s fault but my own.</p>

<p class="pindent">Goodbye and forgive me.</p>

<p class="line8"><span class="calibre2">TRACY</span></p>

</div>

<p class="pindent">Bond didn’t look at the man who had received this letter.
He slid it back to him across the desk. He took a deep drink
of the whisky and reached for the bottle. He said, ‘Yes, I
see.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘She likes to call herself Tracy. She thinks Teresa sounds
too grand.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Commander Bond.’ There was now a terrible urgency in
the man’s voice—urgency, authority and appeal. ‘My friend,
you have heard the whole story and now you have seen the
evidence. Will you help me? Will you help me save this girl?
It is my only chance, that you will give her hope. That you
will give her a reason to live. Will you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond kept his eyes on the desk in front of him. He dared
not look up and see the expression on this man’s face. So he
had been right, right to fear that he was going to become
involved in all this private trouble! He cursed under his
breath. The idea appalled him. He was no Good Samaritan.
He was no doctor for wounded birds. What she needed, he
said fiercely to himself, was the psychiatrist’s couch. All
right, so she had taken a passing fancy to him and he to her.
Now he was going to be asked, he knew it, to pick her up and
carry her perhaps for the rest of his life, haunted by the
knowledge, the unspoken blackmail, that, if he dropped her,
it would almost certainly be to kill her. He said glumly, ‘I
do not see that I can help. What is it you have in mind?’ He
picked up his glass and looked into it. He drank, to give him
courage to look across the desk into Marc-Ange’s face.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man’s soft brown eyes glittered with tension. The
creased dark skin round the mouth had sunk into deeper
folds. He said, holding Bond’s eyes, ‘I wish you to pay court
to my daughter and marry her. On the day of the marriage, I
will give you a personal dowry of one million pounds in
gold.’</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond exploded angrily. ‘What you ask is utterly
impossible. The girl is sick. What she needs is a psychiatrist.
Not me. And I do not want to marry, not anyone. Nor do I
want a million pounds. I have enough money for my needs.
I have my profession.’ (Is that true? What about that letter of
resignation? Bond ignored the private voice.) ‘You must
understand all this.’ Suddenly he could not bear the hurt in
the man’s face. He said, softly, ‘She is a wonderful girl. I
will do all I can for her. But only when she is well again.
Then I would certainly like to see her again—very much.
But, if she thinks so well of me, if you do, then she must first
get well of her own accord. That is the only way. Any doctor
would tell you so. She must go to some clinic, the best there
is, in Switzerland probably, and bury her past. She must
want to live again. Then, only then, would there be any
point in our meeting again.’ He pleaded with Marc-Ange.
‘You do understand, don’t you, Marc-Ange? I am a ruthless
man. I admit it. And I have not got the patience to act as
anyone’s nurse, man or woman. Your idea of a cure might
only drive her into deeper despair. You must see that I
cannot take the responsibility, however much I am attracted
by your daughter.’ Bond ended lamely, ‘Which I am.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The man said resignedly, ‘I understand you, my friend.
And I will not importune you with further arguments. I
will try and act in the way you suggest. But will you please
do one further favour for me? It is now nine o’clock. Will you
please take her out to dinner tonight? Talk to her as you
please, but show her that she is wanted, that you have affection
for her. Her car is here and her clothes. I have had them
brought. If only you can persuade her that you would like
to see her again, I think I may be able to do the rest. Will you
do this for me?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond thought, God, what an evening! But he smiled with
all the warmth he could summon. ‘But of course. I would
love to do that. But I am booked on the first morning flight
from Le Touquet tomorrow morning. Will you be responsible
for her from then?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Certainly, my friend. Of course I will do that.’ Marc-Ange
brusquely wiped a hand across his eyes. ‘Forgive me.
But you have given me hope at the end of a long night.’
He straightened his shoulders and suddenly leaned across
the desk and put his hands decisively down. ‘I will not thank
you. I cannot, but tell me, my dear friend, is there anything
in this world that I can do for you, now at this moment? I
have great resources, great knowledge, great power. They
are all yours. Is there nothing I can do for you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had a flash of inspiration. He smiled broadly. ‘There
is a piece of information I want. There is a man called Blofeld,
Ernst Stavro Blofeld. You will have heard of him. I wish to
know if he is alive and where he is to be found.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Marc-Ange’s face underwent a remarkable change. Now
the bandit, cold, cruel, avenging, looked out through the
eyes that had suddenly gone as hard as brown opals. ‘Aha!’
he said thoughtfully. ‘The Blofeld. Yes, he is certainly alive.
Only recently he suborned three of my men, bribed them
away from the Union. He has done this to me before. Three
of the members of the old <span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">SPECTRE</span></span> were taken from the
Union. Come, let us find out what we can.’</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a single black telephone on the desk. He picked
up the receiver and at once Bond heard the soft crackle of
the operator responding. ‘<span class="it">Dammi u commandu.</span>’ Marc-Ange
put the receiver back. ‘I have asked for my local headquarters
in Ajaccio. We will have them in five minutes. But I must
speak fast. The police may know my frequency, though I
change it every week. But the Corsican dialect helps.’ The
telephone burred. When Marc-Ange picked up the receiver,
Bond could hear the zing and crackle he knew so well. Marc-Ange
spoke, in a voice of rasping authority. ‘<span class="it">Ecco u Capu.
Avette nuttizie di Blofeld, Ernst Stavro? Duve sta?</span>’ A voice
crackled thinly. ‘<span class="it">Site sigura? Ma no ezzatu indirizzu?</span>’ More
crackle. ‘<span class="it">Buon. Sara tutto.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">Marc-Ange put back the receiver. He spread his hands
apologetically. ‘All we know is that he is in Switzerland. We
have no exact address for him. Will that help? Surely your
men there can find him—if the Swiss Sécurité will help. But
they are difficult brutes when it comes to the privacy of a
resident, particularly if he is rich.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s pulse had quickened with triumph. Got you, you
bastard! He said enthusiastically, ‘That’s wonderful, Marc-Ange.
The rest shouldn’t be difficult. We have good friends
in Switzerland.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Marc-Ange smiled happily at Bond’s reaction. He said
seriously, ‘But if things go wrong for you, on this case or in
any other way, you will come at once to me. Yes?’ He
pulled open a drawer and handed a sheet of notepaper over
to Bond. ‘This is my open address. Telephone or cable to
me, but put your request or your news in terms that would
be used in connexion with electrical appliances. A consignment
of radios is faulty. You will meet my representative
at such and such a place, on such and such a date. Yes? You
understand these tricks, and anyway’—he smiled slyly—‘I
believe you are connected with an international export firm.
“Universal Export”, isn’t it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled. How did the old devil know these things?
Should he warn Security? No. This man had become a
friend. And anyway, all this was Herkos Odonton!</p>

<p class="pindent">Marc-Ange said diffidently, ‘And now may I bring in
Teresa? She does not know what we have been discussing.
Let us say it is about one of the South of France jewel robberies.
You represent the insurance company. I have been
making a private deal with you. You can manage that?
Good.’ He got up and came over to Bond and put his hand
on Bond’s shoulder. ‘And thank you. Thank you for everything.’
Then he went out of the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">Oh my God! thought Bond. Now for my side of the
bargain.</p>
