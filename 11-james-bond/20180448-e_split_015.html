<p class="line7"><span class="sc"><span class="gesp">James Bond</span></span> awoke to a scream. It was a terrible, masculine
scream out of hell. It fractionally held its first high, piercing
note and then rapidly diminished as if the man had jumped
off a cliff. It came from the right, from somewhere near the
cable station perhaps. Even in Bond’s room, muffled by the
double windows, it was terrifying enough. Outside it must
have been shattering.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond jumped up and pulled back the curtains, not knowing
what scene of panic, of running men, would meet his eyes.
But the only man in sight was one of the guides, walking
slowly, stolidly up the beaten snow-path from the cable
station to the club. The spacious wooden veranda that
stretched from the wall of the club out over the slope of the
mountain was empty, but tables had been laid for breakfast
and the upholstered chaises-longue for the sunbathers had
already been drawn up in their meticulous, colourful rows.
The sun was blazing down out of a crystal sky. Bond looked
at his watch. It was eight o’clock. Work began early in this
place! People died early. For that had undoubtedly been the
death-scream. He turned back into his room and rang the
bell.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was one of the three men Bond had suspected of being
Russians. Bond became the officer and gentleman. ‘What is
your name?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Peter sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Piotr?’ Bond longed to say. ‘And how are all my old
friends from <span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">SMERSH</span></span>?’ He didn’t. He said, ‘What was that
scream?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Pliss?’ The granite-grey eyes were careful.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A man screamed just now. From over by the cable station.
What was it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It seems there has been an accident, sir. You wish for
breakfast?’ He produced a large menu from under his arm
and held it out clumsily.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What sort of an accident?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It seems that one of the guides has fallen.’</p>

<p class="pindent">How could this man have known that, only minutes after
the scream? ‘Is he badly hurt?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Is possible, sir.’ The eyes, surely trained in investigation,
held Bond’s blandly. ‘You wish for breakfast?’ The menu
was once again nudged forward.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, with sufficient concern, ‘Well, I hope the poor
chap’s all right.’ He took the menu and ordered. ‘Let me
know if you hear what happened.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There will no doubt be an announcement if the matter is
serious. Thank you, sir.’ The man withdrew.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was the scream that triggered Bond into deciding that,
above all things, he must keep fit. He suddenly felt that,
despite all the mystery and its demand for solution, there
would come a moment when he would need all his muscle.
Reluctantly he proceeded to a quarter of an hour of knee-bends
and press-ups and deep-breathing chest-expansions—exercises
of the skiing muscles. He guessed that he might
have to get away from this place. But quick!</p>

<p class="pindent">He took a shower and shaved. Breakfast was brought by
Peter. ‘Any more news about this poor guide?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I have heard no more, sir. It concerns the outdoor staff.
I work inside the club.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond decided to play it down. ‘He must have slipped and
broken an ankle. Poor chap! Thank you, Peter.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thank you, sir.’ Did the granite eyes contain a sneer?</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond put his breakfast on the desk and, with some
difficulty, managed to prise open the double window. He
removed the small bolster that lay along the sill between the
panes to keep out draughts, and blew away the accumulated
dust and small fly-corpses. The cold, savourless air of high
altitudes rushed into the room and Bond went to the thermostat
and put it up to 90 as a counter-attack. While, his head
below the level of the sill, he ate a spare continental breakfast,
he heard the chatter of the girls assembling outside on the
terrace. The voices were high with excitement and debate.
Bond could hear every word.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I really don’t think Sarah should have told on him.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But he came in in the dark and started mucking her about.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You mean actually <span class="it">interfering</span> with her?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So she says. If I’d been her, I’d have done the same. And
he’s such a beast of a man.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Was</span>, you mean. Which one was it, anyway?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘One of the Yugos. Bertil.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, I know. Yes, he was pretty horrible. He had such
dreadful teeth.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You oughtn’t to say such things of the dead.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How do you know he’s dead? What happened to him,
anyway?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He was one of the two you see spraying the start of
the bob-run. You see them with hoses every morning. It’s to
get it good and icy so they’ll go faster. Fritz told me he
somehow slipped, lost his balance, or something. And that
was that. He just went off down the run like a sort of human
bob-sleigh.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Elizabeth! How can you be so heartless about it!’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, that’s what happened. You asked.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But couldn’t he save himself?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t be idiotic. It’s sheet ice, a mile of it. And the bobs
get up to sixty miles an hour. He hadn’t got a prayer.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But didn’t he fly off at one of the bends?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Fritz said he went all the way to the bottom. Crashed into
the timing hut. But Fritz says he must have been dead in the
first hundred yards or so.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, here’s Franz. Franz, can I have scrambled eggs and
coffee? And tell them to make the scrambled eggs runny like
I always have them.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, miss. And you, miss?’ The waiter took the orders
and Bond heard his boots creak off across the boards.</p>

<p class="pindent">The sententious girl was being sententious again. ‘Well,
all I can say is it must have been some kind of punishment for
what he tried to do to Sarah. You always get paid off for
doing wrong.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t be ridiculous. God would never punish you as
severely as that.’ The conversation followed this new hare
off into a maze of infantile morality and the Scriptures.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond lit a cigarette and sat back, gazing thoughtfully at the
sky. No, the girl was right. God wouldn’t mete out such a
punishment. But Blofeld would. Had there been one of
those Blofeld meetings at which, before the full body of
men, the crime and the verdict had been announced? Had
this Bertil been taken out and dropped on to the bob-run?
Or had his companion been quietly dealt the card of death,
told to give the sinner the trip or the light push that was
probably all that had been needed? More likely. The quality
of the scream had been of sudden, fully realized terror as the
man fell, scrabbled at the ice with his fingernails and boots,
and then, as he gathered speed down the polished blue
gully, the blinding horror of the truth. And what a death!
Bond had once gone down the Cresta, from ‘Top’, to prove
to himself that he dared. Helmeted, masked against the blast
of air, padded with leather and foam rubber, that had still
been sixty seconds of naked fear. Even now he could remember
how his limbs had shaken when he rose stiffly from
the flimsy little skeleton bob at the end of the run-out. And
that had been a bare three-quarters of a mile. This man, or
the flayed remains of him, had done over a mile. Had he
gone down head or feet first? Had his body started tumbling?
Had he tried, while consciousness remained, to brake himself
over the edge of one of the early, scientifically banked bends
with the unspiked toe of this boot or that . . . ? No. After the
first few yards, he would already have been going too fast for
any rational thought or action. God, what a death! A typical
Blofeld death, a typical <span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">SPECTRE</span></span> revenge for the supreme
crime of disobedience. That was the way to keep discipline
in the ranks! So, concluded Bond as he cleared the tray
away and got down to his books, <span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">SPECTRE</span></span> walks again! But
down what road this time?</p>

<p class="line10">*          *          *</p>

<p class="pindent">At ten minutes to eleven, Irma Bunt came for him. After
an exchange of affabilities, Bond gathered up an armful of
books and papers and followed her round the back of the
club building and along a narrow, well-trodden path past a
sign that said <span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">PRIVAT. EINTRITT VERBOTEN.</span></span></p>

<p class="pindent">The rest of the building, whose outlines Bond had seen the
night before, came into view. It was an undistinguished but
powerfully built one-storey affair made of local granite
blocks, with a flat cement roof from which, at the far end,
protruded a small, professional-looking radio mast which,
Bond assumed, had given the pilot his landing instructions on
the previous night and which would also serve as the ears and
mouth of Blofeld. The building was on the very edge of the
plateau and below the final peak of Piz Gloria, but out of
avalanche danger. Beneath it the mountain sloped sharply
away until it disappeared over a cliff. Far below again was the
tree line and the Bernina valley leading up to Pontresina,
the glint of a railway track and the tiny caterpillar of a long
goods train of the Rhätische Bahn, on its way, presumably,
over the Bernina Pass into Italy.</p>

<p class="pindent">The door to the building gave the usual pneumatic hiss,
and the central corridor was more or less a duplicate of the
one at the club, but here there were doors on both sides and
no pictures. It was dead quiet and there was no hint of what
went on behind the doors. Bond put the question.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Laboratories,’ said Irma Bunt vaguely. ‘All laboratories.
And of course the lecture-room. Then the Count’s private
quarters. He lives with his work, Sair Hilary.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good show.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They came to the end of the corridor. Irma Bunt knocked
on the facing door.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Herein!’</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond was tremendously excited as he stepped over
the threshold and heard the door sigh shut behind him.
He knew what not to expect, the original Blofeld, last year’s
model—about twenty stone, tall, pale, bland face with black
crew-cut, black eyes with the whites showing all round, like
Mussolini’s, ugly thin mouth, long pointed hands and feet—but
he had no idea what alterations had been contrived on the
envelope that contained the man.</p>

<p class="pindent">But Monsieur le Comte de Bleuville, who now rose from
the chaise-longue on the small private veranda and came in
out of the sun into the penumbra of the study, his hands
outstretched in welcome, was surely not even a distant relative
of the man on the files!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s heart sank. This man was tallish, yes, and, all right,
his hands and naked feet were long and thin. But there the
resemblance ended. The Count had longish, carefully-tended,
almost dandified hair that was a fine silvery white.
His ears, that should have been close to his head, stuck out
slightly and, where they should have had heavy lobes, had
none. The body that should have weighed twenty stone,
now naked save for a black woollen slip, was not more than
twelve stone, and there were no signs of the sagging flesh
that comes from middle-aged weight-reduction. The mouth
was full and friendly, with a pleasant, up-turned, but perhaps
rather unwavering smile. The forehead was serrated with
wrinkles above a nose that, while the files said it should be
short and squat, was aquiline and, round the right nostril,
eaten away, poor chap, by what looked like the badge of
tertiary syphilis. The eyes? Well, there might be something
there if one could see them, but they were only rather
frightening dark-green pools. The Count wore, presumably
against the truly dangerous sun at these altitudes, dark-green
tinted contact lenses.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond unloaded his books on to a conveniently empty table
and took the warm, dry hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My dear Sir Hilary. This is indeed a pleasure.’ Blofeld’s
voice had been said to be sombre and even. This voice was
light and full of animation.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said to himself, furiously, by God this has <span class="it">got</span> to be
Blofeld! He said, ‘I’m so sorry I couldn’t come on the 21st.
There’s a lot going on at the moment.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ah yes. So Fräulein Bunt told me. These new African
States. They must indeed present a problem. Now, shall we
settle down here’—he waved towards his desk—‘or shall we
go outside? You see’—he gestured at his brown body—‘I am
a heliotrope, a sun-worshipper. So much so that I have had
to have these lenses devised for me. Otherwise, the ultraviolet
rays, at this altitude . . .’ He left the phrase unfinished.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I haven’t seen that kind of lens before. After all, I can
leave the books here and fetch them if we need them for
reference. I have the case pretty clear in my mind. And’—Bond
smiled chummily—‘it would be nice to go back to the
fogs with something of a sunburn.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had equipped himself at Lillywhites with clothing
he thought would be both appropriate and sensible. He had
avoided the modern elasticized vorlage trousers and had
chosen the more comfortable but old-fashioned type of ski-trouser
in a smooth cloth. Above these he wore an aged black
wind-cheater that he used for golf, over his usual white Sea Island
cotton shirt. He had wisely reinforced this outfit with
long and ugly cotton and wool pants and vests. He had
conspicuously brand-new ski-boots with powerful ankle-straps.
He said, ‘Then I’d better take off my sweater,’ He
did so and followed the Count out on to the veranda.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Count lay back again in his upholstered aluminium
chaise-longue. Bond drew up a light chair made of similar
materials. He placed it also facing the sun, but at an angle so
that he could watch the Count’s face.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And now,’ said the Comte de Bleuville, ‘what have you
got to tell me that necessitated this personal visit?’ He turned
his fixed smile on Bond. The dark-green glass eyes were
unfathomable. ‘Not of course that the visit is not most
welcome, most welcome. Now then, Sir Hilary.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had been well trained in two responses to this
obvious first question. The first was for the event that the
Count had lobes to his ears. The second, if he had not.
He now, in measured, serious tones, launched himself into
Number Two.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My dear Count’—the form of address seemed dictated by
the silvery hair, by the charm of the Count’s manners—‘there
are occasions in the work of the College when research
and paperwork are simply not enough. We have, as you
know, come to a difficult passage in our work on your case.
I refer of course to the hiatus between the disappearance of
the de Bleuville line around the time of the French Revolution
and the emergence of the Blofeld family, or families,
in the neighbourhood of Augsburg. And’—Bond paused
impressively—‘in the latter context I may later have a proposal
that I hope will find favour with you. But what I am
coming to is this. You have already expended serious funds
on our work, and it would not have been fair to suggest that
the researches should go forward unless there was a substantial
ray of hope in the sky. The possibility of such a ray
existed, but it was of such a nature that it definitely demanded
a physical confrontation.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Is that so? And for what purpose, may I inquire?’</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond recited Sable Basilisk’s examples of the Habsburg
lip, the royal tail, and the others. He then leaned forward
in his chair for emphasis. ‘And such a physical
peculiarity exists in connexion with the de Bleuvilles. You
did not know this?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I was not aware of it. No. What is it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I have good news for you, Count.’ Bond smiled his
congratulations. ‘All the de Bleuville effigies or portraits that
we have been able to trace have been distinctive in one vital
respect, in one inherited characteristic. It appears that the
family had no lobes to their ears!’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Count’s hands went up to his ears and felt them.
Was he acting?</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I see,’ he said slowly. ‘Yes, I see.’ He reflected. ‘And
you had to see this for yourself? My word, or a photograph,
would not have been sufficient?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked embarrassed. ‘I am sorry, Count. But that
was the ruling of Garter King of Arms. I am only a junior
free-lance research worker for one of the Pursuivants. He in
turn takes his orders in these matters from above. I hope you
will appreciate that the College has to be extremely strict
in cases concerned with a most ancient and honourable title
such as the one in question.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The dark pools aimed themselves at Bond like the muzzles
of guns. ‘Now that you have seen what you came to see, you
regard the title as still in question?’</p>

<p class="pindent">This was the worst hurdle. ‘What I have seen certainly
allows me to recommend that the work should continue,
Count. And I would say that our chances of success have
greatly multiplied. I have brought out the materials for a first
sketch of the Line of Descent, and that, in a matter of days,
I could lay before you. But alas, as I have said, there are still
many gaps, and it is most important for me to satisfy Sable
Basilisk particularly about the stages of your family’s migration
from Augsburg to Gdynia. It would be of the greatest
help if I might question you closely about your parentage
in the male line. Even details about your father and grandfather
would be of the greatest assistance. And then, of course,
it would be of the utmost importance if you could spare a day
to accompany me to Augsburg to see if the handwriting of
these Blofeld families in the Archives, their Christian names
and other family details, awaken any memories or connexions
in your mind. The rest would then remain with us at the
College. I could spare no more than a week on this work.
But I am at your disposal if you wish it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Count got to his feet. Bond followed suit. He walked
casually over to the railing and admired the view. Would
this bedraggled fly be taken? Bond now desperately hoped so.
During the interview he had come to one certain conclusion.
There was not a single one of the peculiarities in the Count’s
appearance that could not have been achieved by good acting
and by the most refined facial and stomach surgery applied
to the original Blofeld. Only the eyes could not have been
tampered with. And the eyes were obscured.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You think that with patient work, even with the inclusion
of a few question marks where the connecting links are
obscure, I would achieve an Acre de Notoriété that would
satisfy the Minister of Justice in Paris?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Most certainly,’ lied Bond. ‘With the authority of the
College in support.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The fixed smile widened minutely. ‘That would give me
much satisfaction, Sir Hilary. I <span class="it">am</span> the Comte de Bleuville.
I am certain of it in my heart, in my veins.’ There was real
fervour in the voice. ‘But I am determined that my title shall
be officially recognized. You will be most welcome to remain
as my guest and I shall be constantly at your disposal to help
with your researches.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said politely, but with a hint of weariness, of resignation,
‘All right, Count. And thank you. I will go and make a
start straight away.’</p>
