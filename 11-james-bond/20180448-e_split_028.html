<p class="line7"><span class="sc"><span class="gesp">The next</span></span> day, after lunch, Bond made his way by plane
and train to the Hotel Maison Rouge at Strasbourg, his breath
bearing him close company like some noisome, captive pet.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was totally exhilarated by his hours with Marc-Ange
in Marseilles and by the prospects before him—the job that
was to be done and, at the end of it, Tracy.</p>

<p class="pindent">The morning had been an endless series of conferences
round the model of Piz Gloria and its buildings that had
been put up in the night. New faces came, received their
orders in a torrent of dialect, and disappeared—rough,
murderous faces, bandits’ faces, but all bearing one common
expression, devotion to their Capu. Bond was vastly impressed
by the authority and incisiveness of Marc-Ange as he
dealt with each problem, each contingency, from the obtaining
of a helicopter, down to the pensions that would be paid
to the families of the dead. Marc-Ange hadn’t liked the helicopter
business. He had explained to Bond, ‘You see, my
friend, there is only one source for this machine, the OAS,
the French secret army of the right wing. It happens that
they are under an obligation to me, a heavy one, and that is
the way I would have it. I do not like being mixed up in
politics. I like the country where I operate to be orderly,
peaceful. I do not like revolutions. They make chaos everywhere.
Today, I never know when an operation of my own
is not going to be interfered with by some damned emergency
concerning Algerian terrorists, the rounding up of some nest
of these blasted OAS. And road blocks! House to house
searches! They are the bane of my existence. My men can
hardly move without falling over a nest of flics or SDT spies—that,
as I’m sure you know, is the latest of the French Secret
Services. They are getting as bad as the Russians with their
constant changes of initials. It is the Section Défense Territoire.
It comes under the Ministry of the Interior and I am
finding it most troublesome and difficult to penetrate. Not
like the good old Deuxième. It makes life for the peace-loving
very difficult. But I naturally have my men in the
OAS and I happen to know that the OAS has a military
helicopter, stolen from the French Army, hidden away at a
château on the Rhine not far from Strasbourg. The château
belongs to some crazy fascist count. He is one of those
Frenchmen who cannot live without conspiring against something.
So now he has put all his money and property behind
this General Salan. His château is remote. He poses as an
inventor. His farm people are not surprised that there is
some kind of flying machine kept in an isolated barn with
mechanics to tend it—OAS mechanics, bien entendu. And
now, early this morning, I have spoken on my radio to the
right man and I have the machine on loan for twenty-four
hours with the best pilot in their secret air force. He is
already on his way to the place to make his preparations, fuel,
and so on. But it is unfortunate. Before, these people were
in my debt. Now I am in theirs.’ He shrugged. ‘What matter?
I will soon have them under my thumb again. Half the
police and Customs officers in France are Corsicans. It is an
important laissez-passer for the Union Corse. You understand?’</p>

<p class="line10">*          *          *</p>

<p class="pindent">At the Maison Rouge, a fine room had been booked for
Bond. He was greeted with exaggerated courtesy tinged
with reserve. Where didn’t the freemasonry of the Union
operate? Bond, obedient to the traditions of the town, made
a simple dinner off the finest foie gras, pink and succulent,
and half a bottle of champagne, and retired gratefully to bed.
He spent the next morning in his room, changed into his ski
clothes, and sent out for a pair of snow-goggles and thin
leather gloves, sufficient to give some protection to his hands
but close-fitting enough for the handling of his gun. He
took the magazine out of his gun, pumped out the single
round in the chamber and practised shooting himself in the
wardrobe mirror with the gloves on until he was satisfied.
Then he reloaded and got the fitting of the stitched pigskin
holster comfortable inside the waist-band of his trousers. He
had his bill sent up and paid it, and ordered his suitcase to
be forwarded on to Tracy at the Vier Jahreszeiten. Then he
sent for the day’s papers and sat in front of the window,
watching the traffic in the street and forgetting what he read.</p>

<p class="pindent">When, at exactly midday, the telephone rang, he went
straight down and out to the grey Peugeot 403 he had been
told to expect. The driver was Ché-Ché. He acknowledged
Bond’s greeting curtly and, in silence, they drove for an hour
across the uninteresting countryside, finally turning left off
a secondary road into a muddy lane that meandered through
thick forest. In due course there was the ill-kept stone wall of
a large property and then a vast broken-down iron gateway
leading into a park. On the unweeded drive-way were the
recent tracks of vehicles. They followed these past the
dilapidated façade of a once-imposing château, on through
the forest to where the trees gave way to fields. On the edge
of the trees was a large barn in good repair. They stopped
outside and Ché-Ché sounded three shorts on his horn.
A small door in the wide double doors of the barn opened
and Marc-Ange came out. He greeted Bond cheerfully.
‘Come along in, my friend. You are just in time for some
good Strasbourg sausage and a passable Riquewihr. Rather
thin and bitter. I would have christened it “Château Pis-de-Chat”,
but it serves to quench the thirst.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Inside it was almost like a film set. Lights blazed down on
the ungainly shape of the Army helicopter and from somewhere
came the cough of a small generator. The place seemed
to be full of people. Bond recognized the faces of the Union
men. The others were, he assumed, the local mechanics.
Two men on ladders were busily engaged painting red crosses
on white backgrounds on the black-painted fuselage of the
machine, and the paint of the recognition letters, FL-BGS,
presumably civilian and false, still glittered wetly. Bond was
introduced to the pilot, a bright-eyed, fair-haired young man
in overalls called Georges. ‘You will be sitting beside him,’
explained Marc-Ange. ‘He is a good navigator, but he
doesn’t know the last stretch up the valley and he has never
heard of Piz Gloria. You had better go over the maps with
him after some food. The general route is Basle-Zürich.’
He laughed cheerfully. He said in French, ‘We are going to
have some interesting conversation with the Swiss Air
Defences, isn’t it, Georges?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Georges didn’t smile. He said briefly, ‘I think we can
fool them,’ and went about his business.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond accepted a foot of garlic sausage, a hunk of bread,
and a bottle of the ‘Pis-de-Chat’, and sat on an up-turned
packing-case while Marc-Ange went back to supervising the
loading of the ‘stores’—Schmeisser sub-machine guns and
six-inch square packets in red oilcloth.</p>

<p class="pindent">In due course, Marc-Ange lined up his team, including
Bond, and carried out a quick inspection of side-arms, which,
in the case of the Union men, included well-used flick-knives.
The men, as well as Marc-Ange, were clothed in
brand-new ski clothes of grey cloth. Marc-Ange handed to
all of them armlets in black cloth bearing the neatly stitched
words ‘Bundesalpenpolizei’. When Marc-Ange gave Bond
his, he commented, ‘There is no such force as the “Federal
Police of the Alps”. But I doubt if our <span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">SPECTRE</span></span> friends will
know that. At least the armbands will make an important first
impression.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Marc-Ange looked at his watch. He turned and called out
in French, ‘Two forty-five. All ready? Then let us roll!’</p>

<p class="pindent">The farm tractor attached to the wheel-base of the helicopter
started up, the gates of the barn were thrown wide,
and the great metal insect moved slowly out on to the grassland
under the pale winter sun. The tractor was uncoupled
and the pilot, followed by Bond, climbed up the little
aluminium ladder and then into the raised cockpit and
strapped themselves in. The others followed into the ten-seat
cabin, the ladder was pulled up, and the door banged
and locked. On the ground, the mechanics lifted their thumbs
and the pilot bent to his controls. He pressed the starter and,
after a first indecisive cough, the engine fired healthily and
the great blades began to turn. The pilot glanced back at the
whirring tail-rotor. He waited while the needle on the rotor
speed-indicator crept up to 200, then he released the wheel-brakes
and pulled up slowly on the pitch-lever. The helicopter
trembled, unwilling to leave the earth, but then came
a slight jerk and they were up and climbing rapidly above
the trees. The pilot retracted his wheels above the inflated
snow-floats, gave the machine left rudder, pushed forward
the joystick, and they were off.</p>

<p class="pindent">Almost at once they were over the Rhine and Basle lay
ahead under a thick canopy of chimney-smoke. They reached
two thousand feet and the pilot held it, skirting the town to
the north. Now there came a crackle of static over Bond’s
ear-phones and Swiss Air Control, in thick Schwyzerdütsch,
asked them politely to identify themselves. The pilot made
no reply and the question was repeated with more urgency.
The pilot said in French, ‘I don’t understand you.’ There
was a pause, then a French voice again queried them. The
pilot said, ‘Repeat yourself more clearly.’ The voice did so.
The pilot said, ‘Helicopter of the Red Cross flying blood
plasma to Italy.’ The radio went dead. Bond could imagine
the scene in the control room somewhere down below—the
arguing voices, the doubtful faces. Another voice, with more
authority to it, spoke in French. ‘What is your destination?’
‘Wait,’ said the pilot. ‘I have it here. A moment please.’
After minutes he said, ‘Swiss Air Control?’ ‘Yes, yes.’
‘FL-BGS reporting. My destination is Ospedale Santa
Monica at Bellinzona.’ The radio again went dead, only to
come to life five minutes later. ‘FL-BGS, FL-BGS.’ ‘Yes,’
said the pilot. ‘We have no record of your identification
symbol. Please explain.’ ‘Your registration manual must be
out of date. The aircraft was commissioned only one month
ago.’ Another long pause. Now Zürich lay ahead and the
silver boomerang of the Zürichersee. Now Zürich Airport
came on the air. They must have been listening to Swiss Air
Control. ‘FL-BGS, FL-BGS.’ ‘Yes, yes. What is it now?’
‘You have infringed the Civil Airlines Channel. Land and
report to Flying Control. I repeat. Land and report.’ The
pilot became indignant. ‘What do you mean “land and
report”? Have you no comprehension of human suffering?
This is a mercy flight carrying blood plasma of a rare category.
It is to save the life of an illustrious Italian scientist at
Bellinzona. Have you no hearts down there? You tell me to
“land and report” when a life is at stake? Do you wish to
be responsible for murder?’ This Gallic outburst gave them
peace until they had passed the Zürichersee. Bond chuckled.
He gave a thumbs-up sign to the pilot. But then Federal Air
Control at Berne came on the air and a deep, resonant voice
said, ‘FL-BGS, FL-BGS. Who gave you clearance? I repeat.
Who gave you clearance for your flight?’ ‘You did.’ Bond
smiled into his mouthpiece. The Big Lie! There was nothing
like it. Now the Alps were ahead of them—those blasted
Alps, looking beautiful and dangerous in the evening sun.
Soon they would be in the shelter of the valleys, off the radar
screens. But records had been hastily checked in Berne and
the sombre voice came over to them again. The voice must
have realized that the long debate would have been heard at
every airport and by most pilots flying over Switzerland that
evening. It was extremely polite, but firm. ‘FL-BGS, we
have no record at Federal Air Control of your proposed
flight. I regret but you are transgressing Swiss air-space.
Unless you can give further authority for your flight, kindly
return to Zürich and report to Flying Control.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The helicopter rocked. There was a flash of silver and a
Dassault Mirage with Swiss markings flashed by not a
hundred yards away, turned, leaving a trail of black vapour
from the slow-burning of its fuel at this low altitude, and
headed straight back at them, swerving off to port only at the
last moment. The helicopter gave another lurch. The pilot
spoke angrily into his mouthpiece. ‘Federal Air Control.
This is FL-BGS. For further information contact International
Red Cross at Geneva. I am just a pilot. I am not a
“rond de cuir”, a chairborne flyer. If you have lost the
papers, that is not my fault. I repeat, check with Geneva.
And, in the meantime, kindly call off the whole of the Swiss
Air Force which is at present trying to make my passengers
air-sick.’ The voice came back, but now more faintly, because
of the mountains. ‘Who are your passengers?’ The pilot
played his trump card. ‘Representatives of the world’s press.
They have been listening to all this nonsense coming from
the home of the famous International Red Cross. I wish you
happy reading of your newspapers at breakfast-time tomorrow,
gentlemen. And now, a little peace, yes? And please
record in your log-books that I am not, repeat, not, the Soviet
Air Force invading Switzerland.’</p>

<p class="pindent">There was silence. The Dassault Mirage had disappeared.
They were climbing up the valley and were already past
Davos. The gold-tipped needles of the glittering mountains
seemed to be closing in on them from right and left. Ahead
were the great peaks. Bond looked at his watch. Barely
another ten minutes to go.</p>

<p class="pindent">He turned and glanced down the hatch. The faces of Marc-Ange
and of the others looked up at him, tense and livid
under the setting sun that poured in through the windows,
their eyes glinting redly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond held up his thumb encouragingly. He spread out
his ten fingers in their thin leather gloves.</p>

<p class="pindent">Marc-Ange nodded. There was a shifting of the bodies
in their seats. Bond turned back and gazed ahead, looking for
the soaring peak that he loathed and feared.</p>
