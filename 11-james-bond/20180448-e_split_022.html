<p class="line7"><span class="sc"><span class="gesp">Bond had</span></span> no idea how he managed to stay upright, but at
last it was over and everyone cheered and broke up into pairs
and groups.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tracy got her arm under his. Bond pulled himself together.
He said hoarsely, ‘Mix with the crowd, Tracy. Got to get
away from here. People after me.’ A sudden hope came to
him. ‘Got your car?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, darling. Everything’ll be all right. Just hang on to
me. Are people waiting for you outside?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Could be. Watch out for a big black Mercedes. There
may be shooting. Better stay away from me. I can make it.
Where’s the car?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Down the road to the right. But don’t be silly. Here,
I’ve got an idea. You get into this parka.’ She ran the zip
down and stripped it off. ‘It’ll be a tight fit. Here, put your
arm into this sleeve.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But you’ll get cold.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Do as I tell you. I’ve got a sweater and plenty on underneath.
Now the other arm. That’s right.’ She pulled up the
zip. ‘Darling James, you look sweet.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The fur of the parka smelt of Guerlain’s ‘Ode’. It took
Bond back to Royale. What a girl! The thought of her, of
having an ally, of not being on his own, of being away from
that bloody mountain, revived Bond. He held her hand and
followed her through the crowd that was now streaming
towards the exit. This was going to be a bad moment!
Whether or not that cable car had come on down the mountain,
by now Blofeld would have had time to get one down
full of <span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">SPECTRE</span></span> men. Bond had been seen from the train,
would be known to have made for Samaden. By now they
would have covered the railway station. They would expect
him to try and hide in a crowd. Perhaps the drunken man at
the entrance had remembered him. If that saloon moved
off and revealed the red-arrowed skis, it would be a cert.
Bond let go the girl’s hand and slipped the shattered Rolex
back over the knuckles of his right hand. He had gathered
enough strength, mostly from the girl, to have one more bash
at them!</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked at him. ‘What are you doing?’</p>

<p class="pindent">He took her hand again. ‘Nothing.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They were getting near the exit. Bond peered through the
slits in his mask. Yes, by God! Two of the thugs were
standing beside the ticket man watching the throng with
deadly concentration. On the far side of the road stood the
black Mercedes, petrol vapour curling up from its exhaust.
No escape. There was only bluff. Bond put his arm round
Tracy’s neck and whispered, ‘Kiss me all the way past the
ticket-table. They’re there, but I think we can make it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She flung an arm over his shoulder and drew him to her.
‘How did you know that that’s what I’ve been waiting for?’
Her lips crushed down sideways on his and, in a tide of
laughing, singing people, they were through and on the
street.</p>

<p class="pindent">They turned, still linked, down the road. Yes! There was
the darling little white car!</p>

<p class="pindent">And then the horn on the Mercedes began sounding
urgently. Bond’s gait, or perhaps his old-fashioned ski-trousers,
had given him away to the man in the car!</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Quick, darling!’ said Bond urgently.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl threw herself in under the wheel, pressed the
starter and the car was moving as Bond scrambled in through
the opposite door. Bond looked back. Through the rear
window he could see the two men standing in the road.
They would not shoot with so many witnesses about. Now
they ran to the Mercedes. Thank God it was pointing up the
hill towards St Moritz! And then Tracy had done a controlled
skid round the S-bend in the village and they were
on the main road that Bond had staggered down half an hour
before.</p>

<p class="pindent">It would be five minutes at least before the Mercedes
could turn and get after them. The girl was going like hell,
but there was traffic on the road—tinkling sleighs full of fur-wrapped
merrymakers on their way back to Pontresina, an
occasional car, its snow-chains rattling. She drove on her
brakes and her horn, the same triple wind-horn that sounded
the high discord Bond remembered so well. Bond said,
‘You’re an angel, Tracy. But take it easy. We don’t want to
end up in the ditch.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl glanced sideways at him and laughed with
pleasure. ‘That sounds as if you were feeling better. But I
cannot see you. Now you can take off that silly mask and my
parka. In a minute the heat will come on and you will be
roasted. And I would like to see you as I remember you. But
you are pleased with me?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Life was beginning to come back into Bond. It was so
wonderful to be in this little car with this marvellous girl.
The memory of the dreadful mountain, of all that he had
been through, was receding. Now there was hope again, after
so much dread and despair. He could feel the tensions
uncoiling in his stomach. He said, ‘I’ll tell you if I’m pleased
when we get to Zürich. Can you make it? It’s a hell of a way
to spend Christmas.’ He wound down the window and threw
the domino-mask out, stripped off the parka and draped it
over her shoulders. The big sign for the main road down into
the valley came up. He said, ‘Left here, Tracy. Filisur and
then Coire.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She took the turning, in Bond’s estimation, dangerously
fast. She went into a skid that Bond swore was going to be
uncontrolled. But, even on the black ice of the road, she got
out of it and motored blithely on. Bond said, ‘For God’s
sake, Tracy! How in hell did you manage that? You haven’t
even got chains on.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She laughed, pleased at the awe in his voice. ‘Dunlop
Rally studs on all the tyres. They’re only supposed to be for
Rally drivers, but I managed to wangle a set out of them.
Don’t worry. Just sit back and enjoy the drive.’</p>

<p class="pindent">There was something entirely new in the girl’s voice, a lilt
and happiness that had certainly not been there at Royale.
Bond turned and looked at her carefully for the first time.
Yes, she was somehow a new woman, radiating health and a
kind of inner glow. The tumbled fair hair glittered with
vitality and the half-open, beautiful lips seemed always to
be on the verge of a smile.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Satisfied?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You look absolutely wonderful. But now for God’s sake
tell me how you happened to be at Samaden. It was a bloody
miracle. It saved my life.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right. But then you tell. I’ve never seen a man look so
dead on his feet. I couldn’t believe my eyes. I thought you
must be plastered.’ She gave him a quick glance. ‘You still
look pretty bad. Here’—she leant forward to the dashboard—‘I’ll
switch on the blower. Get you properly warmed up.’
She paused. ‘Well, my bit of the story’s quite simple really.
Papa rang me up one day from Marseilles to find out how
I was. He asked if I had seen you and seemed very annoyed
when he heard I hadn’t. He practically ordered me to go and
find you.’ She glanced at him. ‘He’s quite taken to you, you
know. Anyway he said he had found out the address of a
certain man you were looking for. He said he was sure that
by now you would have found out that address too. He said
that, knowing you, I would find you somewhere close to this
address. It was the Piz Gloria Club. He told me if I found you
to tell you to watch your step, to look after yourself.’ She
laughed. ‘How right he was! Well, so I left Davos, which had
really put me on my feet again, like you said it would, and I
came up to Samaden the day before yesterday. The Seilbahn
wasn’t running yesterday, so I was going to come up today
to look for you. It was all as simple as that. Now you tell.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They had been keeping up a good speed down the sloping,
winding road into the valley. Bond turned to look through
the rear window. He swore under his breath. Perhaps a mile
behind, twin lights were coming after them. The girl said,
‘I know. I’ve been watching in the mirror. I’m afraid they’re
gaining a little. Must be a good driver who knows the road.
Probably got snow-chains. But I think I can hold them. Now
go on. What have you been up to?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gave her a garbled version. There was a big gangster
up the mountain, living under a false name. He was wanted
by the police in England. Bond was vaguely connected with
the police, with the Ministry of Defence. (She snorted,
‘Don’t try and fool me. I know you’re in the Secret Service.
Papa told me so.’ Bond said curtly, ‘Well, Papa’s talking
through his hat.’ She laughed knowingly.) Anyway, Bond
continued, he had been sent out to make sure this was the
man they wanted. He had found out that he was. But the
man had become suspicious of Bond and Bond had had to
get out quickly. He gave her a graphic account of the moonlit
nightmare of the mountain, of the avalanche, of the man who
had been killed by the train, of how he had got to Samaden,
dead beat, and had tried to hide in the crowd on the skating-rink.
‘And then,’ he ended lamely, ‘you turned up like a
beautiful angel on skates, and here we are.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She thought the story over for a minute. Then she said
calmly, ‘And now, my darling James, just tell me how many
of them you killed. And tell me the truth.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Why?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m just curious.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You promise to keep this between you and me?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She said enigmatically, ‘Of course. Everything’s between
you and me from now on.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, there was the main guard at the so-called Club.
That had to be done or I’d be dead myself by now. Then
I suppose one got caught by the avalanche. Then, at the
bottom, one of them shot at me and I had to spear him with
my ski-stick—self-defence. I don’t know how badly he’s
hurt. And then there was the man killed by the train. He’d
fired six shots at me. And anyway it was his own fault.
Let’s say three and a half got themselves killed one way or
another.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How many are left?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What are you getting at?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I just want to know. Trust me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, I think there were about fifteen up there all told.
So that leaves eleven and a half—plus the big man.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And there are three in the car behind? Would they kill us
if they caught us?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m afraid so. I haven’t got any weapons. I’m sorry,
Tracy, but I’m afraid you wouldn’t have much chance either,
being a witness and a sort of accomplice of mine. These
people think I’m pretty bad news for them.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And you are?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes. From now on, I’m the worst.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, I’ve got pretty bad news for you. They’re gaining
on us and I’ve only got a couple of gallons left in the tank.
We’ll have to stop in Filisur. There won’t be a garage open
and it’ll mean waking someone up. Can’t hope to do it under
ten minutes and they’ll have us. You’ll have to think up something
clever.’</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a ravine and an S turn over a bridge. They were
coming out of the first curve over the bridge. Lights blazed
at them from across the ravine. There was half a mile between
the two cars, but the range across the ravine was perhaps only
three hundred yards. Bond wasn’t surprised to see the
familiar blue flames flutter from the front of the car. Chips
of granite from the overhang splattered down on the bonnet
of the car. Then they were into the second half of the S-bend
and out of sight of their pursuers.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now came a stretch of reconstruction work where there
had been a landslide. There were big warning notices: Achtung!
Baustelle! Vorsichtig Fahren!’ The broken road
hugged the mountain-side on the right. On the left was
rickety fencing and then a precipice falling hundreds of feet
down into a gorge with an ice-floed river. In the middle of
the bad stretch, a huge red wooden arrow pointed right to a
narrow track across a temporary bridge. Bond suddenly
shouted ‘Stop!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Tracy pulled up, her front wheels on the bridge. Bond
tore open the door. ‘Get on! Wait for me round the next
corner. It’s the only chance.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Good girl! She got going without a word. Bond ran back
the few yards to the big red arrow. It was held in the forks
of two upright poles. Bond wrenched it off, swung it round
so that it pointed to the left, towards the flimsy fence that
closed off the yards of old road leading to the collapsed
bridge. Bond tore at the fence, pulling the stakes out, flattening
it. Glare showed round the corner behind him. He leaped
across the temporary road into the shadow of the mountain,
flattened himself against it, waited, holding his breath.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Mercedes was coming faster than it should over the
bumpy track, its chains clattering inside the mudguards.
It made straight for the black opening to which the arrow
now pointed. Bond caught a glimpse of white, strained faces
and then the desperate scream of brakes as the driver saw
the abyss in front of him. The car seemed almost to stop,
but its front wheels must have been over the edge. It balanced
for a moment on its iron belly and then slowly, slowly
toppled and there was a first appalling crash as it hit the
rubble beneath the old bridge. Then another crash and
another. Bond ran forward past the lying arrow and looked
down. Now the car was flying upside-down through the air.
It hit again and a fountain of sparks flashed from a rock
ledge. Then, somersaulting, and with its lights somehow still
blazing, it smashed on down into the gorge. It hit a last
outcrop that knocked it sideways and, spinning laterally,
but now with its lights out and only the glint of the moon
on metal, it took the last great plunge into the iced-up river.
A deep rumble echoed up from the gorge and there was the
patter of rocks and stones following the wreckage. And then
all was peaceful, moonlit silence.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond let out his breath in a quiet hiss between his clenched
teeth. Then, mechanically, he straightened things out again,
put up the remains of the fence, lifted the arrow, and put it
back facing to the right. Then he wiped his sweating hands
down the side of his trousers and walked unsteadily down
the road and round the next corner.</p>

<p class="pindent">The little white car was there, pulled in to the side, with
its lights out. Bond got in and slumped into his seat. Tracy
said nothing but got the car going. The lights of Filisur
appeared, warm and yellow in the valley below. She reached
out a hand and held his tightly. ‘You’ve had enough for one
day. Go to sleep. I’ll get you to Zürich. Please do what I
say.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said nothing. He pressed her hand weakly, leaned his
head against the door jamb and was instantly asleep.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was out for the count.</p>
