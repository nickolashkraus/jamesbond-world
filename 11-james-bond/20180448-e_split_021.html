<p class="line7"><span class="sc"><span class="gesp">It was</span></span> tricky, undulating ground. The magnesium flares
had sailed lower and there were ugly patches of black
shadow, any of which might have been a small ravine. Bond
had to check at all of them and each time the sharp Christie
reminded him of his legs and ankles. But he got across without
a fall and pulled up at the flag, panting. He looked back.
The gondola had stopped. They had telephone communication
with the top and bottom stations, but why had it stopped?
As if in answer, blue flames fluttered gaily from the forward
cabin. But Bond heard no bullets. The gondola would be
swaying on its cable. But then, high up above him, from
somewhere near the first flags on the shoulder, came more
rapid fire, from two points, and the snow kicked up daintily
around him. So the guides had finally got after him! His
fall would have cost him minutes. How much lead had he
got? Certainly less than ten minutes. A bullet whanged into
one of his skis and sang off down the mountain. Bond took a
last gulp of breath and got going again, still left-handed,
away from the cable railway, towards the next flag, a distant
dot on the edge of the shadow thrown by the great Matterhorn-shaped
peak of Piz Gloria, which knifed up into the
spangled sky in dreadful majesty.</p>

<p class="pindent">It looked as if the run was going to take him dangerously
close to the skirts of the peak. Something was nagging at his
mind, a tiny memory. What was it? It was something unpleasant.
Yes, by God! The last flag! It had been black.
He was on the Black Run, the one closed because of avalanche
danger! God! Well, he’d had it now. No time to try and get
back on the Red Run. And anyway the Red had a long
stretch close to the cables. He’d just have to chance it. And
what a time to chance it, just after a heavy fall of new snow,
and with all these detonations to loosen up the stuff! When
there was danger of an avalanche, guides forbade even
speech! Well, to hell with it! Bond zoomed on across the
great unmarked slope, got to the next flag, spotted the next,
away down the mountain side towards the tree line. Too steep
to schuss! He would just have to do it in S’s.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then the bastards chose to fire off three more flares
followed by a stream of miscellaneous rockets that burst
prettily among the stars. Of course! Bright idea! This was
for the sake of watchers in the valley who might be inquisitive
about the mysterious explosions high up the mountain. They
were having a party up there, celebrating something. What
fun these rich folk had, to be sure! And then Bond remembered.
But of course! It was Christmas Eve! God rest ye
merry gentlemen, let nothing ye dismay! Bond’s skis hissed
an accompaniment as he zigzagged fast down the beautiful
snow slope. White Christmas! Well, he’d certainly got himself
that!</p>

<p class="pindent">But then, from high up above him, he heard that most
dreaded of all sounds in the high Alps, that rending, booming
crack! The Last Trump! Avalanche!</p>

<p class="pindent">The ground shook violently under Bond’s skis and the
swelling rumble came down to him like the noise of express
trains roaring through a hundred tunnels. God Almighty,
now he really had had it! What was the rule? Point the skis
straight downhill! Try and race it! Bond pointed his skis
down towards the tree line, got down in his ugly crouch and
shot, his skis screaming, into white space.</p>

<p class="pindent">Keep forward, you bastard! Get your hands way in front
of you! The wind of his speed was building up into a great
wall in front of him, trying to knock him off balance. Behind
him the giant roar of the mountain seemed to be gaining.
Other, smaller cracks sounded high up among the crags.
The whole bloody mountain was on the move! If he beat
the gigantic mass of hurtling snow to the tree line, what
comfort would he find there? Certainly no protection until
he was deep in the wood. The avalanche would snap perhaps
the first hundred yards of firs down like match-sticks. Bond
used his brain and veered slightly left-handed. The opening,
the glade cut for the Black Run, would surely be somewhere
below the last flag he had been aiming for. If it wasn’t, he
was a dead duck!</p>

<p class="pindent">Now the wild schuss was coming to an end. The trees
were rushing towards him. Was there a break in the bloody
black line of them? Yes! But more to the left. Bond veered,
dropping his speed, gratefully, but with his ears strained to
gauge the range of the thunder behind and above him. It
couldn’t be far from him. The shudder in the ground had
greatly increased and a lot of the stuff would also find the
hole through the trees, funnel itself in and pursue him even
down there! Yes! There was the flag! Bond hurtled into a
right-hand Christie just as, to his left, he heard the first
trees come crashing down with the noise of a hundred
monster crackers being pulled—Christmas crackers! Bond
flung himself straight down the wide white glade between
the trees. But he could hear that he was losing! The crashing
of the trees was coming closer. The first froth of the white
tide couldn’t be far behind his heels! What did one do when
the avalanche hit? There was only one rule. Get your hands
to your boots and grip your ankles. Then, if you were buried,
there was some hope of undoing your skis, being able, perhaps,
to burrow your way to the surface—if you knew in
your tomb where the surface lay! If you couldn’t go down
like a ball, you would end up immovable, a buried tangle of
sticks and skis at all angles. Thank God the opening at the
end of the glade, the shimmer of the last, easily sloping fields
before the finish, was showing up! The crackling roar behind
him was getting louder! How high would the wall of snow
be? Fifty feet? A hundred? Bond reached the end of the glade
and hurled himself into a right-hand Christie. It was his last
hope, to get below the wide belt of trees and pray that the
avalanche wouldn’t mow down the lot of them. To stay in
the path of the roaring monster at his heels would be suicide!</p>

<p class="pindent">The Christie came off, but Bond’s right ski snarled a root
or a sapling and he felt himself flying through space. He
landed with a crash and lay gasping, all the wind knocked
out of him. Now he was done for! Not even enough strength
to get his hands to his ankles! A tremendous buffet of wind
hit him and a small snow-storm covered him. The ground
shook wildly and a deep crashing roar filled his ears. And
then it had passed him and given way to a slow, heavy
rumble. Bond brushed the snow out of his eyes and got
unsteadily to his feet, both skis loose, his goggles gone. Only
a cricket pitch away, a great torrent of snow, perhaps twenty
feet high, was majestically pouring out of the wood and down
into the meadows. Its much higher, tumbling snout, tossing
huge crags of broken snow around it, was already a hundred
yards ahead and still going fast. But, where Bond stood, it
was now silent and peaceful except for the machine-gunfire
crackling of the trees as they went down in the wood
that had finally protected him. The crackling was getting
nearer! No time to hang about! But Bond took off one
sodden glove and dug into his trouser pocket. If ever he
needed a drink it was now! He tilted the little flask down
his throat, emptied it, and threw the bottle away. Happy
Christmas! he said to himself, and bent to his bindings.</p>

<p class="pindent">He got to his feet and, rather light-headed but with the
wonderful glow of the Enzian in his stomach, started on the
last mile of finishing schuss across the meadows to the right,
away from the still hurtling river of snow. Blast! There was
a fence across the bottom of the meadows! He would have to
take the normal outlet for the runs beside the cable station.
It looked all right. There was no sign of the gondola, but he
could now hear the song of the cables. Had the downcoming
car reversed back up to Piz Gloria, assuming him to have
been killed by the avalanche? There was a large black saloon
car in the forecourt to the cable station, and lights on in the
station, but otherwise no sign of life. Well, it was his only
way to get off the run and on to the road that was his objective.
Bond schussed easily downwards, resting his limbs,
getting his breath back.</p>

<p class="pindent">The sharp crack of a heavy-calibre pistol and the phut as
the bullet hit the snow beside him pulled him together. He
jinked sideways and glanced quickly up to the right, where
the shot had come from. The gun blazed again. A man on
skis was coming fast after him. One of the guides! Of course!
He would have taken the Red Run. Had the other followed
Bond on the Black? Bond hoped so, gave a deep sigh of anger,
and put on all the speed he could, crouching low and jinking
occasionally to spoil the man’s aim. The single shots kept on
coming. It was going to be a narrow shave who got to the
end of the run first!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond studied the finishing point that was now coming at
him fast. There was a wide break in the fence to let the skiers
through, a large parking place in front of the cable station,
and then the low embankment that protected the main line
of the Rhätische Bahn up to Pontresina and the Bernina Pass.
On the other side of the rails the railway embankment
dropped into the road from Pontresina to Samaden, the
junction for St Moritz, perhaps two miles down the valley.</p>

<p class="pindent">Another shot kicked up the snow in front of him. That
was six that had gone. With any luck the man’s pistol was
empty. But that wouldn’t help much. There was no stuffing
left in Bond for a fight.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now a great blaze of light showed coming up the railway
line, and, before it was hidden by the cable station, Bond
identified an express and could just hear the thudding of its
electro-diesels. By God, it would just about be passing the
cable station as he wanted to get across the track! Could he
make it—take a run at the low embankment and clear it and
the lines before the train got there? It was his only hope!
Bond dug in with his sticks to get on extra speed. Hell!
A man had got out of the black car and was crouching,
aiming at him. Bond jinked and jinked again as fire bloomed
from the man’s hand. But now Bond was on top of him.
He thrust hard with the rapier point of a ski-stick and felt it
go through clothing. The man gave a scream and went down.
The guide, now only yards behind, yelled something. The
great yellow eye of the diesel glared down the tracks, and
Bond caught a sideways glimpse of a huge red snow-fan
below the headlight that was fountaining the new snow to
right and left of the engine in two white wings. Now! He
flashed across the parking place, heading straight at the
mound of the embankment and, as he hit, dug both his sticks
in to get his skis off the ground, and hurled himself forward
into the air. There was a brief glimpse of steel rails below, a
tremendous thudding in his ears, and a ferocious blast, only
yards away, from the train’s siren. Then he crashed on to
the icy road, tried to stop, failed, and fetched up in an
almighty skid against the hard snow wall on the other side.
As he did so, there came a terrible scream from behind him, a
loud splintering of wood, and the screech of the train’s brakes
being applied.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the same time, the spray from the snow-fan, that had
now reached Bond, turned pink!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond wiped some of it off his face and looked at it. His
stomach turned. God! The man had tried to follow him,
had been too late or had missed his jump, and had been
caught by the murderous blades of the snow-fan! Mincemeat!
Bond dug a handful of snow off the bank and wiped
it over his face and hair. He rubbed more of it down his
sweater. He suddenly realized that people were pulling down
the windows in the brilliantly-lit train above him. Others
had got down on the line. Bond pulled himself together and
punted off down the black ice of the road. Shouts followed
him—the angry bawls of Swiss citizens. Bond edged his skis
a little against the camber of the road and kept going. Ahead
of him, down the black gulch of the road, in his mind’s eye,
the huge red propeller whirred, sucking him into its steel
whirlpool. Bond, close to delirium, slithered on towards its
bloody, beckoning vortex.</p>

<p class="line10">*          *          *</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond, a grey-faced, lunging automaton, somehow stayed
upright on the two miles of treacherous Langlauf down the
gentle slope to Samaden. Once a passing car, its snow-chains
clattering, forced him into the bank. He leaned against the
comforting soft snow for a moment, the breath sobbing in his
throat. Then he drove himself on again. He had got so far,
done so well! Only a few more hundred yards to the lights
of the darling, straggling little paradise of people and shelter!
The slender campanile of the village church was floodlit and
there was a great warm lake of light on the left of the twinkling
group of houses. The strains of a waltz came over the
still, frozen air. The skating-rink! A Christmas Eve skaters’
ball. That was the place for him! Crowds! Gaiety! Confusion!
Somewhere to lose himself from the double hunt that would
now be on—by <span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">SPECTRE</span></span> and the Swiss police, the cops and
the robbers hand in hand!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s skis hit a pile of horse’s dung from some merrymaker’s
sleigh. He lurched drunkenly into the snow wall of
the road and righted himself, cursing feebly. Come on! Pull
yourself together! Look respectable! Well, you needn’t look
<span class="it">too</span> respectable. After all, it’s Christmas Eve. Here were the
first houses. The noise of accordion music, deliriously nostalgic,
came from a Gasthaus with a beautiful iron sign over its
door. Now there was a twisty, uphill bit—the road to St
Moritz. Bond shuffled up it, placing his sticks carefully. He
ran a hand through his matted hair and pulled the sweat-soaked
handkerchief down to his neck, tucking the ends into
his shirt collar. The music lilted down towards him from the
great pool of light over the skating-rink. Bond pulled himself
a little more upright. There were a lot of cars drawn up,
skis stuck in mounds of snow, luges and toboggans, festoons
of paper streamers, a big notice in three languages across the
entrance: ‘Grand Christmas Eve Ball! Fancy Dress! Entrance
2 Francs! Bring all your friends! Hooray!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond dug in his sticks and bent down to unlatch his skis.
He fell over sideways. If only he could just lie there, go to
sleep on the hard, trodden snow that felt like swansdown!
He gave a small groan and heaved himself gingerly into a
crouch. The bindings were frozen solid, caked, like his boots,
with ice. He got one of his sticks and hacked feebly at the
metal and tried again. At last the latches sprang and the
thongs were off. Where to put the bloody things, hide their
brilliant red markings? He lugged them down the trodden
path towards the entrance, gay with fairy lights, shoved the
skis and the sticks under a big saloon car, and staggered on.
The man at the ticket-table was as drunk as Bond seemed.
He looked up blearily: ‘Zwo Franken. Two francs. Deux
francs.’ The routine incantation was slurred into one portmanteau
word. Bond held on to the table, put down the
coins, and got his ticket. The man’s eyes focused. ‘The fancy
dress, the travesti, it is obligatoire.’ He reached into a box by
his side and threw a black and white domino-mask on the
table. ‘One franc’ He gave a lop-sided smile. ‘Now you are
the gangster, the spy. Yes?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yeah, that’s right.’ Bond paid and put on the mask.
He reluctantly let go of the table and wove through the
entrance. There were raised tiers of wooden benches round
the big square rink. Thank God for a chance to sit down!
There was an empty seat on the aisle in the bottom row at
rink level. Bond stumbled down the wooden steps and fell
into it. He righted himself, said ‘Sorry,’ and put his head in
his hands. The girl beside him, part of a group of harlequins,
Wild Westerners, and pirates, drew her spangled skirt away,
whispered something to her neighbour. Bond didn’t care.
They wouldn’t throw him out on a night like this. Through
the loudspeakers the violins sobbed into ‘The Skaters’
Waltz’. Above them the voice of the MC called, ‘Last dance,
ladies and gentlemen. And then all out on to the rink and
join hands for the grand finale. Only ten minutes to go to
midnight! Last dance, ladies and gentlemen. Last dance!’
There was a rattle of applause. People laughed excitedly.</p>

<p class="pindent">God in Heaven! thought Bond feebly. Now this! Won’t
anybody leave me alone? He fell asleep.</p>

<p class="pindent">Hours later he felt his shoulder being shaken. ‘On to the
rink, sir. Please. All on to the rink for the grand finale.
Only a minute to go.’ A man in purple and gold uniform
was standing beside him, looking down impatiently.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Go away,’ said Bond dully. Then some inner voice told
him not to make a scene, not to be conspicuous. He struggled
to his feet, made the few steps to the rink, somehow stood
upright. His head lowered, like a wounded bull, he looked to
left and right, saw a gap in the human chain round the rink,
and slid gingerly towards it. A hand was held out to him and
he grasped it thankfully. On the other side someone else
was trying to get hold of his free hand. And then there came
a diversion. From right across the rink, a girl in a short black
skating-skirt topped by a shocking-pink fur-lined parka, sped
like an arrow across the ice and came to a crash-stop in front
of Bond. Bond felt the ice particles hit his legs. He looked up.
It was a face he recognized—those brilliant blue eyes, the
look of authority now subdued beneath golden sunburn and
a brilliant smile of excitement. Who in hell?</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl slipped in beside him, seized his right hand in
her left, joined up on her right. ‘James’—it was a thrilling
whisper—‘oh, James. It’s me! Tracy! What’s the matter with
you? Where have you come from?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Tracy,’ said Bond dully. ‘Tracy. Hold on to me. I’m in
bad shape. Tell you later.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Then Auld Lang Syne began and everyone swung linked
hands in unison to the music.</p>
