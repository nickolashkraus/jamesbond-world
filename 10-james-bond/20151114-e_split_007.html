<h2 id="calibre_toc_9" class="calibre8"><a id="Page_039" class="calibre9"></a>4. ‘Dear Viv’</h2>

<p class="pindent">That summer’s night hadn’t finished with me. Opposite
Fullers, a policeman was standing by Derek’s car,
arguing with him. Derek turned and saw me. ‘Here
she is, officer. I said she wouldn’t be a minute. Had
to, er, powder her nose. Didn’t you, darling?’</p>

<p class="pindent">More trouble! More lies! I said yes, breathlessly, and
climbed into the seat beside Derek. The policeman
grinned slyly at me, and said to Derek, ‘All right, sir.
But another time remember there’s no parking on the
Hill. Even for an emergency like that.’ He fingered his
moustache. Derek put the car in gear, thanked the
policeman and gave him the wink of a dirty joke shared,
and we were off at last.</p>

<p class="pindent">Derek said nothing until we had turned right at the
lights at the bottom. I thought he was going to drop
me at the station, but he continued on along the
Datchet road. ‘Phew!’ He let the air out of his lungs
with relief. ‘That was a close shave! Thought we were
for it. Nice thing for my parents to read in the paper
tomorrow. And Oxford! I should have had it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It was ghastly.’</p>

<p class="pindent">There was so much feeling in my voice that he
looked sideways at me. ‘Oh, well. The path of true
love and all that.’ His voice was light and easy. He had
recovered. When would I? ‘Damned shame really,’ he
went on casually. ‘Just when we’d got it all set up.’ He
put enthusiasm into his voice to carry me with him.
‘Tell you what. There’s an hour before the train. Why
don’t we walk up along the river. It’s a well-known
beat for Windsor couples. Absolutely private. Pity to
waste everything, time and so on, now we’ve made up
our minds.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The ‘so on’, I thought, meant ‘the thing’ he had
bought. I was aghast. I said urgently, ‘Oh, but I can’t,
Derek! I simply can’t! You’ve no idea how awful I feel
about what happened.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He looked quickly at me. ‘What do you mean, awful?
You feeling ill or something?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, it’s not that. It’s just that, that it was all so
horrible. So shaming.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, that!’ His voice was contemptuous. ‘We got
away with it, didn’t we? Come on. Be a sport!’</p>

<p class="pindent">That again! But I did want to be comforted, feel his
arms round me, be certain he still loved me, although
everything had gone so wrong for him. But my legs
began to tremble at the thought of going through it
all again. I clutched my knees with my hands to control
them. I said weakly, ‘Oh, well . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s my girl!’</p>

<p class="pindent">We went over the bridge and Derek pulled the car
in to the side. He helped me over a stile into a field
and put his arm round me and guided me along the
little towpath past some house-boats moored under
the willows. ‘Wish we had one of those,’ he said. ‘How
about breaking into one? Lovely double bed. Probably
some drink in the cupboards.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, no, Derek! For heaven’s sake! There’s been
enough trouble.’ I could imagine the loud voice. ‘What’s
going on in there? Are you the owners of this boat?
Come on out and let’s have a look at you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Derek laughed. ‘Perhaps you’re right. Anyway the
grass is just as soft. Aren’t you excited? You’ll see. It’s
wonderful. Then we’ll really be lovers.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, yes, Derek. But you will be gentle, won’t you?
I shan’t be any good at it the first time.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Derek squeezed me excitedly. ‘Don’t you worry. I’ll
show you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I was feeling better, stronger. It was lovely walking
with him in the moonlight. But there was a grove of
trees ahead and I looked at it fearfully. I knew that
would be where it was going to happen. I must, I must
make it easy and good for him! I mustn’t be silly! I
mustn’t cry!</p>

<p class="pindent">The path led through the grove. Derek looked about
him. ‘In there,’ he said. ‘I’ll go first. Keep your head
down.’</p>

<p class="pindent">We crept in among the branches. Sure enough, there
was a little clearing. Other people had been there
before. There was a cigarette packet, a Coca-Cola
bottle. The moss and leaves had been beaten down. I
had the feeling that this was a brothel bed where
hundreds, perhaps thousands, of lovers had pressed
and struggled. But now there was no turning back. At
least it must be a good place for it if so many others
had used it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Derek was eager, impatient. He put his coat down
for me and at once started, almost feverishly, his hands
devouring me. I tried to melt, but my body was still
cramped with nerves and my limbs felt like wood. I
wished he would say something, something sweet and
loving, but he was intent and purposeful, manhandling
me almost brutally, treating me as if I was a big clumsy
doll. ‘Only a Paper Doll, for Me to Call My Own’—the
Ink Spots again! I could hear the deep bass of ‘Hoppy’
Jones and the sweet soprano counterpoint of Bill
Kenny, so piercingly sweet that it tore at the heartstrings.
And underneath, the deep pulse-beat of Charlie
Fuqua’s guitar. The tears squeezed out of my eyes. Oh,
God, what was happening to me? And then the sharp
pain and the short scream I quickly stifled and he was
lying on top of me, his chest heaving and his heart
beating heavily against my breast. I put my arms round
him and felt his shirt wet against my hands.</p>

<p class="pindent">We lay like that for long minutes. I watched the
moonlight filtering down through the branches, and
tried to stop my tears. So that was it! The great
moment. A moment I would never have again. So
now I was a woman and the girl was gone! And there
had been no pleasure, only pain like they all said. But
there remained something. This man in my arms. I
held him more tightly to me. I was his now, entirely
his, and he was mine. He would look after me. We
belonged. Now I would never be alone again. There
were two of us.</p>

<p class="pindent">Derek kissed my wet cheek and scrambled to his
feet. He held out his hands and I pulled down my skirt
and he hauled me up. He looked into my face and
there was embarrassment in his half-smile. ‘I hope it
didn’t hurt too much.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No. But was it all right for you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, yes, rather.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He bent down and picked up his coat. He looked
at his watch. ‘I say! Only a quarter of an hour for the
train! We’d better get moving.’</p>

<p class="pindent">We scrambled back on to the path and as we walked
along I pulled a comb through my hair and brushed
at my skirt. Derek walked silently beside me. His face
under the moon was now closed, and when I put my
arm through his there was no answering pressure. I
wished he would be loving, talk about our next meeting,
but I could feel that he was suddenly withdrawn, cold.
I hadn’t got used to men’s faces after they’ve done it.
I blamed myself. It hadn’t been good enough. And I
had cried. I had spoiled it for him.</p>

<p class="pindent">We came to the car, and drove silently to the station.
I stopped him at the entrance. Under the yellow light
his face was taut and strained and his eyes only half
met mine. I said, ‘Don’t come to the train, darling. I
can find my way. What about next Saturday? I could
come down to Oxford. Or would you rather wait until
you’re settled in?’</p>

<p class="pindent">He said defensively. ‘Trouble is, Viv. Things are going
to be different at Oxford. I’ll have to see. Write to
you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I tried to read his face. This was so different from
our usual parting. Perhaps he was tired. God knew I
was! I said, ‘Yes, of course. But write to me quickly,
darling. I’d like to know how you’re getting on.’ I
reached up and kissed him on the lips. His own lips
hardly responded.</p>

<p class="pindent">He nodded. ‘Well, so long, Viv,’ and with a kind of
twisted smile he turned and went off round the corner
to his car.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">It was two weeks later that I got the letter. I had written
twice, but there had been no answer. In desperation I
had even telephoned, but the man at the other end
had gone away and come back and said that Mr Mallaby
wasn’t at home.</p>

<p class="pindent">The letter began, ‘Dear Viv, This is going to be a
difficult letter to write.’ When I had got that far I went
into my bedroom and locked the door and sat on my
bed and gathered my courage. The letter went on to
say that it had been a wonderful summer and he would
never forget me. But now his life had changed and he
would have a lot of work to do and there wouldn’t be
much room for ‘girls’. He had told his parents about
me, but they disapproved of our ‘affair’. They said it
wasn’t fair to go on with a girl if one wasn’t going to
marry her. ‘They are terribly insular, I’m afraid, and
they have ridiculous ideas about “foreigners”, although
heaven knows I regard you as just like any other English
girl and you know I adore your accent.’ They were set
on his marrying the daughter of some neighbour in
the country. ‘I’ve never told you about this, which I’m
afraid was very naughty of me, but as a matter of fact
we’re sort of semi-engaged. We had such a marvellous
time together and you were such a sport that I didn’t
want to spoil it all.’ He said he hoped very much we
would ‘run into each other’ again one day and in the
meantime he had asked Fortnum’s to send me a dozen
bottles of pink champagne, ‘the best’, to remind me
of the first time we had met. ‘And I do hope this letter
won’t upset you too much, Viv, as I really think you’re
the most wonderful girl, far too good for someone
like me. With much love, happy memories, Derek.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Well, it took just ten minutes to break my heart and
about another six months to mend it. Accounts of
other people’s aches and pains are uninteresting
because they are so similar to everybody else’s, so I
won’t go into details. I didn’t even tell Susan. As I saw
it, I’d behaved like a tramp, from the very first evening,
and I’d been treated like a tramp. In this tight little
world of England, I was a Canadian, and therefore a
foreigner, an outsider—fair game. The fact that I hadn’t
seen it happening to me was more fool me. Born
yesterday! Better get wise, or you’ll go on being hurt!
But beneath this open-eyed, chin-up rationalization,
the girl in me whimpered and cringed, and for a time
I cried at night and went down on my knees to the
Holy Mother I had forsaken and prayed that She would
give Derek back to me. But of course She wouldn’t,
and my pride forbade me to plead with him or to
follow up my curt little note of acknowledgement to
his letter and the return of the champagne to Fortnum’s.
The endless summer had ended. All that was
left were some poignant Ink Spot memories, and the
imprint of the nightmare in the cinema in Windsor,
the marks of which I knew I would bear all my life.</p>

<p class="pindent">I was lucky. The job I had been trying for came up.
It was through the usual friend-of-a-friend, and it was
on the <span class="it">Chelsea Clarion</span>, a glorified parish magazine that
had gone in for small ads and had established itself
as a kind of market-place for people looking for flats
and rooms and servants in the south-west part of
London. It had added some editorial pages that dealt
only with local problems—the hideous new lamp
standards, infrequent buses on the Number 11 route,
the theft of milk bottles—things that really affected
the local housewives, and it ran a whole page of local
gossip, mostly ‘Chelsea’, that ‘everybody’ came to read
and that somehow managed to dodge libel actions. It
also had a hard-hitting editorial on Empire Loyalist
lines that exactly suited the politics of the neighbourhood,
and, for good measure, it was stylishly made up
each week (it was a weekly) by a man called Harling
who was quite a dab at getting the most out of the
old-fashioned type faces that were all our steam-age
jobbing printers in Pimlico had in stock. In fact it was
quite a good little paper, and the staff liked it so much
they worked for a pittance and even for nothing when
the ads didn’t materialize in times like August and over
the holidays. I got five pounds a week (we were non-union:
not important enough), plus commission on
any ads I could rustle up.</p>

<p class="pindent">So I quietly tucked the fragments of my heart somewhere
under my ribs and decided to get along without
one for the future. I would rely on brains and guts and
shoe-leather to show these damned English snobs that
if I couldn’t get anywhere else with them I could at
least make a living out of them. So I went to work by
day and cried by night and I became the most willing
horse on the paper. I made tea for the staff, attended
the funerals and got the lists of the mourners right,
wrote spiky paragraphs for the gossip page, ran the
competition column, and even checked the clues of
the crossword before it went into type. And, in
between, I hustled round the neighbourhood, charming
ads out of the most hardbitten shops and hotels and
restaurants and piling up my twenty-per-cents with the
tough old Scotswoman who kept the accounts. Soon
I was making good money—twelve to twenty pounds
a week—and the editor thought he would economize
by stabilizing me at a salary of fifteen, so he installed
me in a cubby-hole next to him and I became his
editorial assistant, which apparently carried with it the
privilege of sleeping with him. But at the first pinch
of my behind I told him that I was engaged to a man
in Canada, and, when I said it, I looked him so furiously
in the eye that he got the message and left me
alone. I liked him and from then on we got on fine.
He was an ex-Beaverbrook reporter called Len Holbrook,
who had come into some money and had decided to
go into business for himself. He was a Welshman and,
like all of them, something of an idealist. He had
decided that if he couldn’t change the world he would
at least make a start on Chelsea, and he bought the
broken-down <span class="it">Clarion</span> and started laying about him. He
had a tip-off on the Council and another in the local
Labour Party organization, and he got off to a flying
start when he revealed that a jerry-builder had got the
contract for a new block of Council flats and that he
wasn’t building to specification—not putting enough
steel in the concrete or something. The Nationals
picked up the story, with tongs because it stank of
libel, and, as luck would have it, cracks began to appear
in the uprights and pictures got taken. There was an
inquiry, the builder lost his contract and his licence,
and the <span class="it">Clarion</span> put a red St-George-and-Dragon on
its mast-head. There were other campaigns, like the
ones I mentioned earlier, and suddenly people were
reading the little paper and it put on more pages and
soon had a circulation of around forty thousand
and the Nationals were regularly stealing its stories and
giving it an occasional puff in exchange.</p>

<p class="pindent">Well, I settled down in my new job as ‘Assistant to
the Editor’ and I was given more writing to do and
less legwork and in due course, after I had been there
for a year, I graduated to a by-line and ‘Vivienne Michel’
became a public person and my salary went up to
twenty guineas. Len liked the way I got on with things
and wasn’t afraid of people, and he taught me a lot
about writing—tricks like hooking the reader with your
lead paragraph, using short sentences, avoiding ‘okay’
English and, above all, writing about <span class="it">people</span>. This he
had learned from the <span class="it">Express</span>, and he was always drumming
it into my head. For instance, he had a phobia
about the 11 and 22 bus services and he was always
chasing them. I began one of my many stories about
them, ‘Conductors on the Number 11 service complain
that they have to work to too tight a schedule in the
rush-hours.’ Len put his pencil through it. ‘People,
people, people! This is how it ought to go, “Frank
Donaldson, a wideawake young man of twenty-seven,
has a wife, Gracie, and two children, Bill, six, and
Emily, five. And he has a grouse. ‘I haven’t seen my
kids in the evening ever since the summer holidays,’
he told me in the neat little parlour of number 36
Bolton Lane. ‘When I get home they’re always in bed.
You see, I’m a conductor, on the 11 route, and we’ve
been running an hour late regular, ever since the new
schedules came in.’ ” ’ Len stopped. ‘See what I mean?
There are people driving those buses. They’re more
interesting than the buses. Now you go out and find
a Frank Donaldson and make that story of yours come
alive.’ Cheap stuff, I suppose, corny angles, but that’s
journalism and I was in the trade and I did what he
told me and my copy began to draw the letters—from
the Donaldsons of the neighbourhood and their wives
and their mates. And editors seem to love letters. They
make a paper look busy and read.</p>

<p class="pindent">I stayed with the <span class="it">Clarion</span> another two years, until I
was just over twenty-one, and by then I was getting
offers from the Nationals, from the <span class="it">Express</span> and the
<span class="it">Mail</span>, and it seemed to me it was time to get out of
SW3 and into the world. I was still living with Susan.
She had got a job with the Foreign Office in something
called ‘Communications’, about which she was very
secretive, and she had a boy-friend from the same
department and I knew it wouldn’t be long before they
got engaged and she would want the whole flat. My
own private life was a vacuum—a business of drifting
friendships and semi-flirtations from which I always
recoiled, and I was in danger of becoming a hard, if
successful, little career girl, smoking too many cigarettes
and drinking too many vodkas-and-tonics and
eating alone out of tins. My gods, or rather goddesses
(Katherine Whitehorn and Penelope Gilliatt were
outside my orbit), were Drusilla Beyfus, Veronica
Papworth, Jean Campbell, Shirley Lord, Barbara Griggs
and Anne Sharpley—the top women journalists—and
I only wanted to be as good as any of them and
nothing else in the world.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then, at a press show in aid of a Baroque
Festival in Munich, I met Kurt Rainer of the VWZ.</p>
