<p class="pindent">When I came to, I at once knew where I was and
what had happened and I cringed closer to the floor,
waiting to be hit again. I stayed like that for about
ten minutes, listening to the roar of the rain, wondering
if the electric shock had done me permanent damage,
burned me, inside perhaps, making me unable to have
babies, or turned my hair white. Perhaps all my hair
had been burned off! I moved a hand to it. It felt all
right, though there was a bump at the back of my
head. Gingerly I moved. Nothing was broken. There
was no harm. And then the big General Electric icebox
in the corner burst into life and began its cheerful,
domestic throbbing and I realized that the world was
still going on and that the thunder had gone away and
I got rather weakly to my feet and looked about me,
expecting I don’t know what scene of chaos and
destruction. But there it all was, just as I had ‘left’ it—the
important-looking reception desk, the wire rack
of paperbacks and magazines, the long counter of
the cafeteria, the dozen neat tables with rainbow-hued
plastic tops and uncomfortable little metal chairs, the
big ice-water container and the gleaming coffee percolator—everything
in its place, just as ordinary as could
be. There was only the hole in the window and a
spreading pool of water on the floor as evidence of
the holocaust through which this room and I had just
passed. Holocaust? What was I talking about? The
only holocaust had been in my head! There was a
storm. There had been thunder and lightning. I had
been terrified, like a child, by the big bangs. Like an
idiot I had taken hold of the electric switch—not
even waiting for the pause between lightning flashes,
but choosing just the moment when another flash was
due. It had knocked me out. I had been punished with
a bump on the head. Served me right, stupid, ignorant
scaredy cat! But wait a minute! Perhaps my hair <span class="it">had</span>
turned white! I walked, rather fast, across the room,
picked up my bag from the desk and went behind the
bar of the cafeteria and bent down and looked into
the long piece of mirror below the shelves. I looked
first inquiringly into my eyes. They gazed back at me,
blue, clear, but wide with surmise. The lashes were
there and the eyebrows, brown, an expanse of
inquiring forehead and then, yes, the sharp, brown
peak and the tumble of perfectly ordinary very dark
brown hair curving away to right and left in two big
waves. So! I took out my comb and ran it brusquely,
angrily through my hair, put the comb back in my bag
and snapped the clasp.</p>

<p class="pindent">My watch said it was nearly seven o’clock. I switched
on the radio, and while I listened to WOKO frightening
its audience about the storm—power lines
down, the Hudson River rising dangerously at Glens
Falls, a fallen elm blocking Route 9 at Saratoga Springs,
flood warning at Mechanicville—I strapped a bit of
cardboard over the broken window-pane with Scotch
tape and got a cloth and bucket and mopped up the
pool of water on the floor. Then I ran across the
short covered way to the cabins out back and went
into mine, Number 9 on the right-hand side towards
the lake, and took off my clothes and had a cold
shower. My white Terylene shirt was smudged from
my fall and I washed it and hung it up to dry.</p>

<p class="pindent">I had already forgotten my chastisement by the
storm and the fact that I had behaved like a silly goose,
and my heart was singing again with the prospect of
my solitary evening and of being on my way the next
day. On an impulse, I put on the best I had in my
tiny wardrobe—my black velvet toreador pants with
the rather indecent gold zip down the seat, itself most
unchastely tight, and, not bothering with a bra, my
golden thread Camelot sweater with the wide floppy
turtleneck. I admired myself in the mirror, decided
to pull my sleeves up above the elbows, slipped my
feet into my gold Ferragamo sandals, and did the quick
dash back to the lobby. There was just one good drink
left in the quart of Virginia Gentleman bourbon that
had already lasted me two weeks, and I filled one
of the best cut-glass tumblers with ice cubes and
poured the bourbon over them, shaking the bottle to
get out the last drop. Then I pulled the most comfortable
armchair over from the reception side of the
room to stand beside the radio, turned the radio up,
lit a Parliament from the last five in my box, took a
stiff pull at my drink, and curled myself into the
armchair.</p>

<p class="pindent">The commercial, all about cats and how they loved
Pussy-foot Prime Liver Meal, lilted on against the
steady roar of the rain, whose tone only altered when
a particularly heavy gust of wind hurled the water like
grapeshot at the windows and softly shook the
building. Inside, it was just as I had visualized—weatherproof,
cosy and gay and glittering with lights
and chromium. WOKO announced forty minutes of
‘Music To Kiss By’ and suddenly there were the Ink
Spots singing ‘Someone’s Rockin’ my Dream Boat’
and I was back on the River Thames and it was five
summers ago and we were drifting down past Kings
Eyot in a punt and there was Windsor Castle in the
distance and Derek was paddling while I worked the
portable. We only had ten records, but whenever it
came to be the turn of the Ink Spots’ LP and the
record got to ‘Dream Boat’, Derek would always plead,
‘Play it again, Viv,’ and I would have to go down on
my knees and find the place with the needle.</p>

<p class="pindent">So now my eyes filled with tears—not because of
Derek, but because of the sweet pain of boy and girl
and sunshine and first love with its tunes and snapshots
and letters ‘Sealed With A Loving Kiss’. They
were tears of sentiment for lost childhood, and of
self-pity for the pain that had been its winding sheet,
and I let two tears roll down my cheeks before I
brushed them away and decided to have a short orgy
of remembering.</p>

<p class="pindent">My name is Vivienne Michel and, at the time I was
sitting in the Dreamy Pines motel and remembering,
I was twenty-three. I am five feet six, and I always
thought I had a good figure until the English girls at
Astor House told me my behind stuck out too much
and that I must wear a tighter bra. My eyes, as I have
said, are blue and my hair a dark brown with a natural
wave and my ambition is one day to give it a lion’s
streak to make me look older and more dashing. I like
my rather high cheekbones, although these same girls
said they made me look ‘foreign’, but my nose is too
small, and my mouth too big so that it often looks
sexy when I don’t want it to. I have a sanguine temperament
which I like to think is romantically tinged with
melancholy, but I am wayward and independent to an
extent that worried the sisters at the convent and
exasperated Miss Threadgold at Astor House. (‘Women
should be willows, Vivienne. It is for men to be oak
and ash.’)</p>

<p class="pindent">I am French-Canadian. I was born just outside
Quebec at a little place called Sainte Famille on the
north coast of the Ile d’Orléans, a long island that lies
like a huge sunken ship in the middle of the St Lawrence
River where it approaches the Quebec Straits. I grew
up in and beside this great river, with the result that
my main hobbies are swimming and fishing and
camping and other outdoor things. I can’t remember
much about my parents—except that I loved my father
and got on badly with my mother—because when I
was eight they were both killed in a wartime air crash
coming in to land at Montreal on their way to a wedding.
The courts made me a ward of my widowed aunt,
Florence Toussaint, and she moved into our little house
and brought me up. We got on all right, and today I
almost love her, but she was a Protestant, while I had
been brought up as a Catholic, and I became the victim
of the religious tug of war that has always been the
bane of priest-ridden Quebec, so nearly exactly divided
between the faiths. The Catholics won the battle over
my spiritual well-being, and I was educated in the
Ursuline Convent until I was fifteen. The sisters were
strict and the accent was very much on piety, with the
result that I learned a great deal of religious history
and rather obscure dogma which I would gladly have
exchanged for subjects that would have fitted me to be
something other than a nurse or a nun and, when in
the end the atmosphere became so stifling to my spirit
that I begged to be taken away, my aunt gladly rescued
me from ‘The Papists’ and it was decided that, at the
age of sixteen, I should go to England and be ‘finished’.
This caused something of a local hullabaloo. Not only
are the Ursulines the centre of Catholic tradition in
Quebec—the Convent proudly owns the skull of Montcalm:
for two centuries there have never been less than
nine sisters kneeling at prayer, night and day, before
the chapel altar—but my family had belonged to the
very innermost citadel of French-Canadianism and that
their daughter should flout both treasured folkways at
one blow was a nine days’ wonder—and scandal.</p>

<p class="pindent">The true sons and daughters of Quebec form a
society, almost a secret society, that must be as
powerful as the Calvinist clique of Geneva, and the
initiates refer to themselves proudly, male or female,
as ‘Canadiennes’. Lower, much lower, down the scale
come the ‘Canadiens’—Protestant Canadians. Then
‘Les Anglais’, which embraces all more or less recent
immigrants from Britain, and lastly, ‘Les Américains’,
a term of contempt. The Canadiennes pride themselves
on their spoken French, although it is a bastard
patois full of two-hundred-year-old words which
Frenchmen themselves don’t understand and is larded
with Frenchified English words—rather, I suppose,
like the relationship of Afrikaans to the language
of the Dutch. The snobbery and exclusiveness of
this Quebec clique extend even towards the
French who live in France. These mother-people to
the Canadiennes are referred to simply as ‘Etrangers’!
I have told all this at some length to explain that the
defection from The Faith of a Michel from Sainte
Famille was almost as heinous a crime as a defection,
if that were possible, from the Mafia in Sicily, and it
was made pretty plain to me that, in leaving the
Ursulines and Quebec, I had just about burned my
bridges so far as my spiritual guardians and my home
town were concerned.</p>

<p class="pindent">My aunt sensibly pooh-poohed my nerves over the
social ostracism that followed—most of my friends
were forbidden to have anything to do with me—but
the fact remains that I arrived in England loaded with
a sense of guilt and ‘difference’ that, added to my
‘colonialism’, were dreadful psychological burdens
with which to face a smart finishing school for young
ladies.</p>

<p class="pindent">Miss Threadgold’s Astor House was, like most of
these very English establishments, in the Sunningdale
area—a large Victorian stockbrokery kind of place,
whose upper floors had been divided up with plaster-board
to make bedrooms for twenty-five pairs of girls.
Being a ‘foreigner’ I was teamed up with the other
foreigner, a dusky Lebanese millionairess with huge
tufts of mouse-coloured hair in her armpits, and an
equal passion for chocolate fudge and an Egyptian
film star called Ben Saïd, whose gleaming photograph—gleaming
teeth, moustache, eyes and hair—was soon
to be torn up and flushed down the lavatory by the
three senior girls of Rose Dormitory, of which we
were both members. Actually I was saved by the
Lebanese. She was so dreadful, petulant, smelly and
obsessed with her money that most of the school
took pity on me and went out of their way to be kind.
But there were many others who didn’t, and I was
made to suffer agonies for my accent, my table
manners, which were considered uncouth, my total
lack of savoir-faire and, in general, for being a
Canadian. I was also, I see now, much too sensitive
and quick-tempered. I just wouldn’t take the bullying
and teasing, and when I had roughed up two or three
of my tormentors, others got together with them and
set upon me in bed one night and punched and
pinched and soaked me with water until I burst into
tears and promised I wouldn’t ‘fight like an elk’ any
more. After that, I gradually settled down, made an
armistice with the place, and morosely set about
learning to be a ‘lady’.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was the holidays that made up for everything. I
made friends with a Scottish girl, Susan Duff, who
liked the same open-air things as I did. She too was
an only child and her parents were glad to have me
to keep her company. So there was Scotland in the
summer and skiing in the winter and spring—all over
Europe, in Switzerland, Austria, Italy—and we stuck
to each other through the finishing school and at the
end we even ‘came out’ together and Aunt Florence
produced five hundred pounds as my contribution to
an idiotic joint dance at the Hyde Park Hotel, and I
got on the same ‘list’ and went the rounds of similar
idiotic dances at which the young men seemed to me
rude and spotty and totally unmasculine compared
with the young Canadians I had known. (But I may
have been wrong because one of the spottiest of them
rode in the Grand National that year and finished the
course!)</p>

<p class="pindent">And then I met Derek.</p>

<p class="pindent">By now I was seventeen and a half and Susan and
I were living in a tiny three-room flat in Old Church
Street, just off the King’s Road. It was the end of June
and there wasn’t much more of our famous ‘season’
to go and we decided to give a party for the few
people we had met and actually liked. The family
across the landing were going abroad on holiday, and
they said we could have their flat in exchange for
keeping an eye on it while they were away. We were
both of us just about broke with ‘keeping up with
the Joneses’ at all these balls, and I cabled Aunt
Florence and got a hundred pounds out of her and
Susan scraped up fifty and we decided to do it really
well. We were going to ask about thirty people and
we guessed that only twenty would come. We bought
eighteen bottles of champagne—pink because it
sounded more exciting—a ten-pound tin of caviar,
two rather cheap tins of <span class="it">foie gras</span> that looked all right
when it was sliced up, and lots of garlicky things from
Soho. We made a lot of brown bread-and-butter sandwiches
with watercress and smoked salmon, and added
some sort of Christmasy things like Elvas plums and
chocolates—a stupid idea: no one ate any of them—and,
by the time we had spread the whole lot out
on a door taken off its hinges and covered with a
gleaming table-cloth to make it seem like a buffet, it
looked like a real grown-up feast.</p>

<p class="pindent">The party was a great success, almost too much of
a success. All the thirty came and some of them
brought others and there was a real squash with people
sitting on the stairs and even one man on the loo with
a girl on his lap. The noise and the heat were terrific.
Perhaps after all we weren’t such squares as we had
thought, or perhaps people really like squares so long
as they are true squares and don’t pretend. Anyway
of course the worst happened and we ran out of
drink! I was standing by the table when some wag
drained the last bottle of champagne and shouted in
a strangled voice, ‘Water! Water! Or we’ll never see
England again.’ I got fussed and said stupidly, ‘Well,
there just isn’t any more,’ when a tall young man
standing against the wall said, ‘Of course there is.
You’ve forgotten the cellar,’ and he took me by the
elbow and shoved me out of the room and down the
stairs. ‘Come on,’ he said firmly. ‘Can’t spoil a good
party. We’ll get some more from the pub.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Well, we went to the pub and got two bottles of
gin and an armful of bitter lemon and he insisted on
paying for the gin so I paid for the lemon. He was
rather tight in a pleasant way and explained that he’d
been to another party before ours and that he’d been
brought by a young married couple called Norman,
who were friends of Susan’s. He said his name was
Derek Mallaby, but I didn’t pay much attention as I
was so anxious to get the drink back to the party.
There were cheers as we came back up the stairs, but
in fact the party had passed its peak and from then
on people drifted away until there was nothing left
but the usual hard core of particular friends, and
characters who had nowhere to go for dinner. Then
they too slowly broke up, including the Normans, who
looked very nice and told Derek Mallaby that he would
find the key under the mat, and Susan was suggesting
that we go to the Popotte across the way, a place I
didn’t care for, when Derek Mallaby came and lifted
my hair away from my ear and whispered rather
hoarsely into it would I go slumming with him? So I
said yes, largely I think because he was tall and because
he had taken charge when I was stuck.</p>

<p class="pindent">So we drifted out into the hot evening street leaving
the dreadful battlefield of the party behind, and Susan
and her friends wandered off and we got a taxi in the
King’s Road. Derek took me right across London to
a spaghetti house called ‘The Bamboo’ near the
Tottenham Court Road and we had spaghetti Bolognese
and a bottle of instant-Beaujolais, as he called it, that
he sent out for. He drank most of the Beaujolais, and
told me that he lived not far from Windsor and that
he was nearly eighteen and this was his last term at
school and he was in the cricket eleven and that he
had been given twenty-four hours off in London to
see lawyers as his aunt had died and left him some
money. His parents had spent the day with him and
they had gone to see the MCC play Kent at Lord’s.
They had then gone back to Windsor and left him
with the Normans. He was supposed to have gone to
a play and then home to bed, but there had been this
other party and then mine, and now how about going
on to the ‘400’?</p>

<p class="pindent">Of course, I was thrilled. The ‘400’ is the top nightclub
in London and I had never graduated higher than
the cellar places in Chelsea. I told him a bit about
myself and made Astor House sound funny and he
was very easy to talk to, and when the bill came he
knew exactly how much to tip and it seemed to me
that he was very grown-up to be still at school, but
then English public schools are supposed to grow
people up very quickly and teach them how to behave.
He held my hand in the taxi, and that seemed to be
all right, and they seemed to know him at the ‘400’
and it was deliciously dark and he ordered gins and
tonics and they put a half bottle of gin on the table
that was apparently his from the last time he had been
there. Maurice Smart’s band was as smooth as cream
and when we danced we fitted at once and his jive
was just about the same as mine and I was really
having fun. I began to notice the way his dark hair
grew at the temples and that he had good hands and
that he smiled not just at one’s face but into one’s
eyes. We stayed there until four in the morning and
the gin was finished and when we went out on to the
pavement I had to hold on to him. He got a taxi and
it seemed natural when he took me in his arms, and
when he kissed me I kissed back. After I had twice
taken his hand off my breast, the third time it seemed
prissy not to leave it there, but when he moved it
down and tried to put it up my skirt, I wouldn’t let
him, and when he took my hand and tried to put it
on him I wouldn’t do that either, although my whole
body was hot with wanting these things. But then,
thank heavens, we were outside the flat and he got
out and took me to the door and we said we would
see each other again and he would write. When we
kissed goodbye, he put his hand down behind my
back and squeezed my behind hard, and when his taxi
disappeared round the corner I could still feel his
hand there and I crept up to bed and looked into the
mirror over the washbasin and my eyes and face were
radiant as if they were lit up from inside and, although
probably most of the lighting-up came from the gin,
I thought, ‘Oh, my heavens! I’m in love!’</p>
