<p class="pindent">The rain was still crashing down, its violence unchanged.
The eight o’clock news continued its talk of havoc
and disaster—a multiple crash on Route 9, railway
tracks flooded at Schenectady, traffic at a standstill in
Troy, heavy rain likely to continue for several hours.
American life is completely dislocated by storms and
snow and hurricanes. When American automobiles
can’t move, life comes to a halt, and, when their famous
schedules can’t be met, they panic and go into a kind
of paroxysm of frustration, besieging railway stations,
jamming the long-distance wires, keeping their radios
permanently switched on for any crumb of comfort.
I could imagine the chaos on the roads and in the
cities, and I hugged my cosy solitude to me.</p>

<p class="pindent">My drink was nearly dead. I kept it just alive with
some more ice cubes, lit another cigarette, and settled
down again in my chair while a disc jockey announced
half an hour of Dixieland jazz.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kurt hadn’t liked jazz. He thought it decadent. He
also stopped me smoking and drinking and using
lipstick and life became a serious business of art
galleries and concerts and lecture halls. As a contrast
to my meaningless, rather empty life, it was a welcome
change and I dare say the diet of Teutonism appealed
to the rather heavy seriousness that underlies the
Canadian character.</p>

<p class="pindent">VWZ, the Verband Westdeutscher Zeitungen, was an
independent news agency financed by a co-operative of
West German newspapers rather on the lines of Reuters.
Kurt Rainer was its first representative in London and
when I met him he was on the look-out for an English
number two to read the papers and weeklies for items
of German interest while he did the high-level diplomatic
stuff and covered outside assignments. He took
me out to dinner that night, to Schmidts in Charlotte
Street, and was rather charmingly serious about the
importance of his job and how much it might mean
for Anglo-German relationships. He was a powerfully
built, outdoor type of young man whose bright fair
hair and candid blue eyes made him look younger than
his thirty years. He told me that he came from Augsburg,
near Munich, and that he was an only child of
parents who were both doctors and had both been
rescued from a concentration camp by the Americans.
They had been informed on and arrested for listening
to the Allied radio and for preventing young Kurt from
joining the Hitler Youth Movement. He had been
educated at Munich High School and at the University,
and had then gone into journalism, graduating to <span class="it">Die
Welt</span>, the leading West German newspaper, from which
he had been chosen for this London job because of
his good English. He asked me what I did, and the
next day I went round to his two-room office in Chancery
Lane and showed him some of my work. With
typical thoroughness he had already checked up on me
through friends at the Press Club, and a week later I
found myself installed in the room next to his with
the PA/Reuter and the Exchange Telegraph tickers
chattering beside my desk. My salary was wonderful—thirty
pounds a week—and I soon got to love the
work, particularly operating the Telex with our <span class="it">Zentrale</span>
in Hamburg, and the twice-daily rush to catch the
morning and evening deadlines of the German papers.
My lack of German was only a slight handicap, for,
apart from Kurt’s copy which he put over by telephone,
all my stuff went over the Telex in English and was
translated at the other end, and the Telex operators in
Hamburg had enough English to chatter with me when
I was on the machine. It was rather a mechanical job,
but you had to be quick and accurate and it was fun
judging the success or failure of what I sent by the
German cuttings that came in a few days later. Soon
Kurt had enough confidence to leave me alone in
charge of the office, and there were exciting little
emergencies I had to handle by myself with the thrill
of knowing that twenty editors in Germany were
depending on me to be fast and right. It all seemed
so much more important and responsible than the
parochial trivialities of the <span class="it">Clarion</span>, and I enjoyed the
authority of Kurt’s directions and decisions, combined
with the constant smell of urgency that goes with news
agency work.</p>

<p class="pindent">In due course Susan got married and I moved out
to furnished rooms in Bloomsbury Square in the same
building as Kurt. I had wondered if this was a good
idea, but he was so <span class="it">korrekt</span> and our relationship was
so <span class="it">kameradschaftlich</span>—words which he constantly
employed about social situations—that I thought I
was being at least adequately sensible. It was very silly
of me. Apart from the fact that Kurt probably misunderstood
my easy acceptance of his suggestion that
I find a place in his building, it now became natural
that we should walk home together from the near-by
office. Dinners together became more frequent and,
later, to spare the expense, he would bring his gramophone
up to my sitting-room and I would cook
something for both of us. Of course, I saw the danger
and I invented several friends to spend the evening
with. But this meant sitting by myself in some cinema
after a lonely meal with all the nuisance of men trying
to pick one up. And Kurt remained so <span class="it">korrekt</span> and
our relationship on such a straightforward and even
highminded level that my apprehensions came to seem
idiotic and more and more I accepted a comradely
way of life that seemed not only totally respectable
but also adult in the modern fashion. I was all the
more confident because, after about three months of
this peaceful existence, Kurt, on his return from a
visit to Germany, told me that he had become engaged.
She was a childhood friend called Trude and, from
all he told me, they were ideally suited. She was the
daughter of a Heidelberg professor of philosophy,
and the placid eyes that stared out of the snapshots
he showed me, and the gleaming braided hair and trim
dirndl, were a living advertisement for ‘<span class="it">Kinder, Kirche,
Küche</span>’.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kurt involved me closely in the whole affair, translating
Trude’s letters to me, discussing the number of
children they would have, and asking my advice on the
decoration of the flat they planned to buy in Hamburg
when he had finished his three years’ stint in London
and had saved enough money for marriage. I became
a sort of Universal Aunt to the two of them, and I
would have found the role ridiculous if it hadn’t all
seemed quite natural and rather fun—like having two
big dolls to play at ‘Weddings’ with. Kurt had even
planned their sex life minutely and the details which
he insisted, rather perversely, on sharing with me, were
at first embarrassing and then, because he was so
clinical about the whole subject, highly educative. On
the honeymoon in Venice (all Germans go to Italy for
their honeymoons) they would of course do it every
night because, Kurt said, it was most important that
‘the act’ should be technically perfect and, to achieve
this, much practice was necessary. To this end, they
would have a light dinner, because a full stomach was
not desirable, and they would retire not later than
eleven o’clock because it was important to have at least
eight hours’ sleep ‘to recharge the batteries’. Trude, he
said, was unawakened and inclined to be ‘kühl’ sexually,
while he was of a passionate temperament. So there
would have to be much preliminary sex-play to bring
the curve of her passion up to his. This would need
restraint on his part, and in this matter he would have
to be firm with himself, for as he told me, it was
essential to a happy marriage that the climax should
be reached simultaneously by the partners. Only thus
could the thrilling summits of <span class="it">Ekstase</span> become the
equal property of both. After the honeymoon they
would sleep together on Wednesdays and Saturdays.
To do it more often would weaken his ‘batteries’ and
might reduce his efficiency at the ‘Büro’. All this Kurt
illustrated with a wealth of most explicit scientific
words and even with diagrams and drawings done on
the table-cloth with a fork.</p>

<p class="pindent">The lectures, for such they were, convinced me that
Kurt was a lover of quite exceptional finesse, and I
admit I was fascinated and rather envious of the well-regulated
and thoroughly hygienic delights that were
being prepared for Trude. There were many nights
when I longed for these experiences to be mine, and
for someone to play upon me also like, as Kurt put it,
‘a great violinist playing upon his instrument’. And
it was inevitable, I suppose, that in my dreams it
was Kurt who came to me in that role—so safe, so
gentle, so deeply understanding of a woman’s physical
needs.</p>

<p class="pindent">The months passed and gradually the tone and
frequency of Trude’s letters began to change. It was
I who noticed it first, but I said nothing. There were
more frequent and sharper complaints about the length
of the waiting period, the tender passages became
more perfunctory, and the pleasures of a summer
holiday on the Tegernsee, where Trude had met up
with a ‘happy group’, after a first ecstatic description,
were, significantly I thought, not mentioned again. And
then, after three weeks of silence from Trude, Kurt
came up to my rooms one evening, his face pale and
wet with tears. I was lying on the sofa, reading, and
he fell on his knees beside me and buried his head on
my breast. It was all over, he said between sobs. She
had met another man, at the Tegernsee of course, a
doctor from Munich, a widower. He had proposed to
her and she had accepted. It had been love at first
sight. Kurt must understand that such a thing only
happened once in a girl’s lifetime. He must forgive her
and forget her. She was not good enough for him.
(Ah! That shabby phrase again!) They must remain
honourable friends. The marriage was to take place
next month. Kurt must try and wish her well. Farewell,
your abject Trude.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kurt’s arms were round me and he was holding me
desperately. ‘Now I have only you,’ he said through
his sobs. ‘You must be kind. You must give me
comfort.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I smoothed his hair as maternally as I could,
wondering how to escape from his embrace, yet at the
same time being melted by the despair of this strong
man and by his dependence on me. I tried to make
my voice sound matter-of-fact. ‘Well, if you ask me,
it was a lucky escape. Any girl as changeable as that
would not have made you a good wife. There are many
other better girls in Germany. Come on, Kurt.’ I struggled
to sit up. ‘We’ll go out to dinner and a cinema. It
will take your mind off things. It’s no good crying over
spilt milk. Come on!’ I freed myself rather breathlessly
and we both got to our feet.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kurt hung his head. ‘Ah, but you are good to me,
Viv. You are a real friend in need—<span class="it">eine echte Kameradin</span>.
And you are right. I must not behave like a weakling.
You will be ashamed of me. And that I could not
bear.’ He gave me a tortured smile and went to the
door and let himself out.</p>

<p class="pindent">Only two weeks later we were lovers. It was somehow
inevitable. I had half known it would be, and I did
nothing to dodge my fate. I was not in love with him,
and yet we had grown so close in so many other ways
that the next step of sleeping together was bound,
inexorably, to follow. The details were really quite dull.
The occasional friendly kiss on the cheek, as if to a
sister, came by degrees closer to my mouth and one
day was on it. There was a pause in the campaign while
I came to take this kind of kiss for granted, then came
the soft assault on my breasts and then on my body,
all so pleasurable, so calm, so lacking in drama, and
then, one evening in my sitting-room, the slow stripping
of my body ‘because I must see how beautiful
you are’, the feeble, almost languorous protests, and
then the scientific operation that had been prepared
for Trude. And how delicious it was, in the wonderful
privacy of my own room! How safe, how unhurried,
how reassuring the precautions! And how strong and
gentle Kurt was, and of all things to associate with
love-making, how divinely polite! A single flower after
each time, the room tidied after each passionate ecstasy,
studious correctness in the office and before other
people, never a rough or even a dirty word—it was
like a series of exquisite operations by a surgeon with
the best bedside manners in the world. Of course, it
was all rather impersonal. But I liked that. It was sex
without involvement or danger, a delicious heightening
of the day’s routine which each time left me sleek and
glowing like a pampered cat.</p>

<p class="pindent">I might have realized, or at any rate guessed, that,
at least among amateur women as opposed to prostitutes,
there is no physical love without emotional
involvement—over a long period, that is. Physical
intimacy is halfway to love, and enslavement is much
of the other half. Admittedly my mind and much of
my instincts didn’t enter into our relationship. They
remained dormant, happily dormant. But my days and
my nights were so full of this man, I was so dependent
on him for so much of the twenty-four hours, that it
would have been almost inhuman not to have fallen
into some sort of love with him. I kept on telling
myself that he was humourless, impersonal, unfunloving,
wooden and, finally, most excessively
German, but that didn’t alter the fact that I listened
for his step on the stairs, worshipped the warmth and
authority of his body, and was happy at all times to
cook and mend and work for him. I admitted to myself
that I was becoming a vegetable, a docile <span class="it">Hausfrau</span>,
walking, in my mind, six paces behind him on the
street like some native bearer, but I also had to admit
that I was happy, contented and carefree, and that I
didn’t really yearn for any other kind of life. There
were moments when I wanted to break out of the
douce, ordered cycle of the days, shout and sing and
generally create hell, but I told myself that these
impulses were basically anti-social, unfeminine, chaotic
and psychologically unbalanced. Kurt had made me
understand these things. For him, symmetry, the even
tempo, the right thing in the right place, the calm voice,
the measured opinion, love on Wednesdays and Saturdays
(after a light dinner!) were the way to happiness
and away from what he described as ‘The Anarchic
Syndrome’—i.e., smoking and drinking, phenobarbital,
jazz, promiscuous sleeping-about, fast cars, slimming,
Negroes and their new republics, homosexuality, the
abolition of the death penalty and a host of other
deviations from what he described as <span class="it">Naturmenschlichkeit</span>,
or, in more words but shorter ones, a way of
life more like the ants and the bees. Well, that was all
right with me. I had been brought up to the simple
life and I was very happy to be back in it after my
brief taste of the rackety round of Chelsea pubs and
gimcrack journalism, not to mention my drama-fraught
affair with Derek, and I did quietly fall into some sort
of love with Kurt.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then, inevitably, it happened.</p>

<p class="pindent">Soon after we started making regular love, Kurt had
steered me towards a reliable woman doctor who gave
me a homely lecture about contraception and fixed me
up. But she warned that even these precautions could
go wrong. And they did. At first, hoping for the best,
I said nothing to Kurt, but then, from many motives—not
wanting to carry the secret alone, the faint hope
that he might be pleased and ask me to marry him, and
a genuine fear about my condition—I told him. I had
no idea what his reaction might be, but of course I
expected tenderness, sympathy, and at least a show of
love. We were standing by the door of my bedroom,
preparatory to saying goodnight. I hadn’t a stitch of
clothes on, while he was fully dressed. When I had
finished telling him, he quietly disengaged my arms from
round his neck, looked my body up and down with
what I can only call a mixture of anger and contempt,
and reached for the door handle. Then he looked me
coldly in the eyes, said very softly, ‘So?’ and walked out
of the room and shut the door quietly behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">I went and sat down on the edge of my bed and
stared at the wall. What had I done? What had I said
wrong? What did Kurt’s behaviour mean? Then, weak
with foreboding, I got into bed and cried myself to
sleep.</p>

<p class="pindent">I was right to cry. The next morning, when I called
for him downstairs for our usual walk to the office,
he had already gone out. When I got to the office, the
communicating door with mine was closed, and when,
after a quarter of an hour or so, he opened the door
and said we must have a talk, his face was icily cold.
I went into his office and sat down with the desk
between us: an employee being interviewed by the boss—being
sacked, as it turned out.</p>

<p class="pindent">The burden of his speech, delivered in matter-of-fact,
impersonal tones, was this. In a comradely liaison
such as we had enjoyed, and it had indeed been most
enjoyable, it was essential that matters should run
smoothly, in an orderly fashion. We had been (yes,
‘had been’) good friends, but I would agree that there
had never been any talk of marriage, of anything more
permanent than a satisfactory understanding between
comrades (that word again!). It had indeed been a most
pleasant relationship, but now, through the fault of
one of the partners (me alone, I suppose!), this had
happened, and now a radical solution must be found
for a problem that contained elements of embarrassment
and even of danger for our life-paths. Marriage—alas,
for he had an excellent opinion of my qualities
and above all of my physical beauty—was out of the
question. Apart from other considerations, he had
inherited strong views about mixed blood (Heil Hitler!)
and when he married, it would be into the Teutonic
strain. Accordingly, and with sincere regret, he had
come to certain decisions. The most important was
that I must have an immediate operation. Three
months was already a dangerous delay. This would be
a simple matter. I would fly to Zürich and stay at one
of the hotels near the Hauptbahnhof. Any taxi driver
would take me there from the airport. I would ask the
concierge for the name of the hotel doctor—there
were excellent doctors in Zürich—and I would consult
him. He would understand the situation. All Swiss
doctors did. He would suggest that my blood pressure
was too high or too low, or that my nerves were not
in a fit state to support the strain of childbirth. He
would speak to a gynaecologist—there were superb
gynaecologists in Zürich—and I would visit this man
who would confirm what the doctor had said and
sign a paper to that effect. The gynaecologist would
make a reservation at a clinic and the whole matter
would be solved inside a week. There would be
complete discretion. The procedure was perfectly
legal in Switzerland, and I would not even have to
show my passport. I could give any name I chose—a
married name, naturally. The cost would however
be high. Perhaps as much as one hundred, or even
one hundred and fifty pounds. That also he had seen
to. He reached into the drawer of his desk, took out
an envelope and slid it across the table. It would be
reasonable, after nearly two years’ excellent service,
for me to receive one month’s salary in lieu of notice.
That was one hundred and twenty pounds. Out of
his own pocket he had taken the liberty of adding
fifty pounds to cover the air fare, tourist class, and
leave something over for emergencies. The whole
sum was in Reichsmarks to avoid any problem over
the exchange.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kurt smiled tentatively, waiting for my thanks and
congratulations for his efficiency and generosity. He
must have been put out by the expression of blank
horror on my face, because he hurried on. Above all,
I must not worry. These unfortunate things happened
in life. They were painful and untidy. He himself was
most distressed that so happy a relationship, one of
the happiest in his experience, should come to an end.
As alas it had to. He added finally that he hoped I
understood.</p>

<p class="pindent">I nodded and got to my feet. I picked up the
envelope, took one last look at the golden hair, the
mouth I had loved, the strong shoulders, and feeling
the tears coming, I walked quickly out of the room
and shut the door softly behind me.</p>

<p class="pindent">Before I met Kurt, I had been a bird with a wing
down. Now I had been shot in the other.</p>
