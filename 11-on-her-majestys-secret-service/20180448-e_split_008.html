<p class="line7"><span class="sc"><span class="gesp">She was</span></span> waiting in the big double bed, a single sheet pulled
up to her chin. The fair hair was spread out like golden wings
under the single reading light that was the only light in the
room, and the blue eyes blazed with a fervour that, in other
girls, in other beds, James Bond would have interpreted. But
this one was in the grip of stresses he could not even guess at.
He locked the door behind him and came over and sat on the
edge of her bed and put one hand firmly on the little hill that
was her left breast. ‘Now listen, Tracy,’ he began, meaning
to ask at least one or two questions, find out something about
this wonderful girl who did hysterical things like gambling
without the money to meet her debts, driving like a potential
suicide, hinting that she had had enough of life.</p>

<p class="pindent">But the girl reached up a swift hand that smelt of Guerlain’s
‘Ode’ and put it across his lips. ‘I said “no conversation”.
Take off those clothes. Make love to me. You are
handsome and strong. I want to remember what it can be
like. Do anything you like. And tell me what you like and
what you would like from me. Be rough with me. Treat me
like the lowest whore in creation. Forget everything else. No
questions. Take me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">An hour later, James Bond slipped out of bed without
waking her, dressed by the light of the promenade lights
filtering between the curtains, and went back to his room.</p>

<p class="pindent">He showered and got in between the cool, rough French
sheets of his own bed and switched off his thinking about her.
All he remembered, before sleep took him, was that she had
said when it was all over, ‘That was heaven, James. Will you
please come back when you wake up. I must have it once
more.’ Then she had turned over on her side away from him
and, without answering his last endearments, had gone to
sleep—but not before he had heard that she was crying.</p>

<p class="pindent">What the hell? All cats are grey in the dark.</p>

<p class="pindent">True or false?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond slept.</p>

<p class="pindent">At eight o’clock he woke her and it was the same glorious
thing again. But this time he thought that she held him to
her more tenderly, kissed him not only with passion but with
affection. But, after, when they should have been making
plans about the day, about where to have lunch, when to
bathe, she was at first evasive and then, when he pressed her,
childishly abusive.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Get to hell away from me! Do you hear? You’ve had what
you wanted. Now get out!’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Wasn’t it what you wanted too?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No. You’re a lousy goddam lover. Get out!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond recognized the edge of hysteria, at least of desperation.
He dressed slowly, waiting for the tears to come, for the
sheet that now covered her totally to shake with sobs. But
the tears didn’t come. That was bad! In some way this girl
had come to the end of her tether, of too many tethers. Bond
felt a wave of affection for her, a sweeping urge to protect
her, to solve her problems, make her happy. With his hand
on the door-knob he said softly, ‘Tracy. Let me help you.
You’ve got some troubles. That’s not the end of the world.
So have I. So has everyone else.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The dull clichés fell into the silent, sun-barred room, like
clinker in a grate.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Go to hell!’</p>

<p class="pindent">In the instant of opening and closing the door, Bond
debated whether to bang it shut, to shake her out of her
mood, or to close it softly. He closed it softly. Harshness
would do no good with this girl. She had had it, somehow,
somewhere—too much of it. He went off down the corridor,
feeling, for the first time in his life, totally inadequate.</p>

<p class="line10">*          *          *</p>

<p class="pindent">(The Bombard thrashed on up river. It had passed the
marina and, with the narrowing banks, the current was
stronger. The two thugs in the stern still kept their quiet eyes
on Bond. In the bows, the girl still held her proud profile
into the wind like the figure-head on a sailing ship. In Bond,
the only warmth was in his contact with her back and his
hand on the haft of his knife. Yet, in a curious way, he felt
closer to her, far closer, than in the transports of the night
before. Somehow he felt she was as much a prisoner as he was.
How? Why? Way ahead the lights of the Vieux Port, once close
to the sea, but now left behind by some quirk of the Channel
currents that had built up the approaches to the river, shone
sparsely. Before many years they would go out and a new
harbour, nearer the mouth of the river, would be built for
the deep-sea trawlers that served Royale with their soles and
lobsters and crabs and prawns. On this side of the lights were
occasional gaunt jetties built out into the river by private
yacht-owners. Behind them were villas that would have names
like ‘Rosalie’, ‘Toi et Moi’, ‘Nid Azur’ and ‘Nouvelle
Vague’. James Bond nursed the knife and smelt the ‘Ode’
that came to him above the stink of mud and seaweed from
the river banks. His teeth had never chattered before. Now
they chattered. He stopped them and went back to his memories.)</p>

<p class="pindent">Normally, breakfast was an important part of Bond’s day,
but today he had barely noticed what he was eating, hurried
through the meal and sat gazing out of his window and across
the promenade, chain-smoking and wondering about the girl.
He knew nothing positive about her, not even her nationality.
The Mediterranean was in her name, yet she was surely
neither Italian nor Spanish. Her English was faultless and
her clothes and the way she wore them were the products of
expensive surroundings—perhaps a Swiss finishing school.
She didn’t smoke, seemed to drink only sparingly, and there
was no sign of drugtaking. There had not even been sleeping
pills beside the bed or in her bathroom. She could only be
about twenty-five, yet she made love with the fervour and
expertness of a girl who, in the American phrase, had ‘gone
the route’. She hadn’t laughed once, had hardly smiled. She
seemed in the grip of some deep melancholy, some form of
spiritual accidie that made life, on her own admission, no
longer worth living. And yet there were none of those signs
that one associates with the hysteria of female neurotics—the
unkempt hair and sloppy make-up, the atmosphere of disarray
and chaos they create around them. On the contrary, she
seemed to possess an ice-cold will, authority over herself
and an exact idea of what she wanted and where she was going.
And where was that? In Bond’s book she had desperate intentions,
most likely suicide, and last night had been the last
fling.</p>

<p class="pindent">He looked down at the little white car that was now not
far from his in the parking lot. Somehow he must stick close
to her, watch over her, at least until he was satisfied that his
deadly conclusions were wrongs. As a first step, he rang down
to the concierge and ordered a drive-yourself Simca Aronde.
Yes, it should be delivered at once and left in the parking lot.
He would bring his international driving licence and green
insurance card down to the concierge who would kindly complete
the formalities.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shaved and dressed and took the papers down and
returned to his room. He stayed there, watching the entrance
and the little white car until 4.30 in the afternoon. Then, at
last, she appeared, in the black and white striped bathing-wrap,
and Bond ran down the corridor to the lift. It was not
difficult to follow her as she drove along the promenade and
left her car in one of the parking lots, and it was also no problem
for the little anonymous 2CV Citroen that followed
Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then had been set up the train of the watchers and the
watched which was now drawing to its mysterious climax
as the little Bombard thrashed its way up the River Royale
under the stars.</p>

<p class="pindent">What to make of it all? Had she been a witting or unwitting
bait? Was this a kidnapping? If so, of one or of both? Was it
blackmail? The revenge of a husband or another lover? Or
was it to be murder?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was still raking his mind for clues when the helmsman
turned the Bombard in a wide curve across the current
towards a battered, skeletal jetty that projected from the
muddy bank into the stream. He pulled up under its lee, a
powerful flashlight shone down on them out of the darkness,
a rope clattered down and the boat was hauled to the foot
of muddy wooden steps. One of the thugs climbed out first,
followed by the girl, the white bottom of her bathing dress
lascivious below Bond’s coat, then Bond, then the second
thug. Then the Bombard backed quickly away and continued
up river, presumably, thought Bond, to its legitimate mooring
in the Vieux Port.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were two more men, of much the same build as the
others, on the jetty. No words were spoken as, surrounded,
the girl and Bond were escorted up the small dust road that
led away from the jetty through the sand dunes. A hundred
yards from the river, tucked away in a gully between tall
dunes, there was a glimmer of light. When Bond got nearer
he saw that it came from one of those giant corrugated aluminium
transport-trucks that, behind an articulated driver’s
cabin, roar down the arterial routes of France belching diesel
smoke and hissing angrily with their hydraulic brakes as they
snake through the towns and villages. This one was a glinting,
polished affair. It looked new, but might just be well cared
for. As they approached, the man with the flashlight gave
some signal, and an oblong of yellow light promptly blazed
as the caravan-like door in the rear was thrown open. Bond
fingered his knife. Were the odds in any way within reason?
They were not. Before he climbed up the steps into the
interior, he glanced down at the numberplate. The commercial
licence said, ‘Marseille-Rhône. M. Draco. Appareils
Électriques. 397694.’ So! One more riddle!</p>

<p class="pindent">Inside it was, thank God, warm. A passage-way led between
stacked rows of cartons marked with the famous names
of television manufacturers. Dummies? There were also
folded chairs and the signs of a disturbed game of cards. This
was presumably used as the guard-room. Then, on both sides,
the doors of cabins. Tracy was waiting at one of the doors.
She held out his coat to him, said an expressionless ‘Thank
you’ and closed the door after Bond had caught a brief
glimpse of a luxurious interior. Bond took his time putting on
his coat. The single man with the gun who was following him
said impatiently, ‘Allez!’ Bond wondered whether to jump
him. But, behind, the other three men stood watching. Bond
contented himself with a mild ‘Merde à vous!’ and went ahead
to the aluminium door that presumably sealed off the third
and forward compartment in this strange vehicle. Behind this
door lay the answer. It was probably one man—the leader.
This might be the only chance. Bond’s right hand was already
grasping the hilt of his knife in his trouser pocket. Now he
put out his left hand and, in one swirl of motion, leaped
through, kicked the door shut behind him and crouched, the
knife held for throwing.</p>

<p class="pindent">Behind him he felt the guard throw himself at the door,
but Bond had his back to it and it held. The man, ten feet
away behind the desk, within easy range for the knife, called
out something, an order, a cheerful, gay order in some
language Bond had never heard. The pressure on the door
ceased. The man smiled a wide, a charming smile that cracked
his creased walnut of a face in two. He got to his feet and
slowly raised his hands. ‘I surrender. And I am now a much
bigger target. But do not kill me, I beg of you. At least not
until we have had a stiff whisky and soda and a talk. Then I
will give you the choice again. OK?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond rose to his full height. He smiled back. He couldn’t
help it. The man had such a delightful face, so lit with
humour and mischief and magnetism that, at least in the
man’s present role. Bond could no more have killed him than
he could have killed, well, Tracy.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a calendar hanging on the wall beside the man.
Bond wanted to let off steam against something, anything.
He said, ‘September the sixteenth,’ and jerked his right hand
forward in the underhand throw. The knife flashed across the
room, missed the man by about a yard, and stuck, quivering,
half-way down the page of the calendar.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man turned and looked inquisitively at the calendar.
He laughed out loud. ‘Actually the fifteenth. But quite respectable,
I must set you against my men one of these days.
And I might even bet on you. It would teach them a lesson.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He came out from behind his desk, a smallish, middle-aged
man with a brown, crinkled face. He was dressed in the sort
of comfortable dark-blue suit Bond himself wore. The chest
and the arms bulged with muscle. Bond noticed the fullness
of the cut of the coat under the arm-pits. Built for guns? The
man held out a hand. It was warm and firm and dry. ‘Marc-Ange
Draco is my name. You have heard of it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Aha! But I have heard of yours. It is Commander James
Bond. You have a decoration called the CMG. You are a
member, an important member, of Her Majesty’s Secret
Service. You have been taken off your usual duties and you
are on temporary assignment abroad.’ The impish face creased
with delight. ‘Yes?’</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond, to cover his confusion, walked across to the
calendar, verified that he had in fact pierced the fifteenth,
pulled out the knife and slipped it back in his trouser pocket.
He turned and said, ‘What makes you think so?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The man didn’t answer. He said, ‘Come. Come and sit
down. I have much to talk to you about. But first the whisky
and soda. Yes?’ He indicated a comfortable armchair across
the desk from his own, put in front of it a large silver box
containing various kinds of cigarettes, and went to a metal
filing cabinet against the wall and opened it. It contained no
files. It was a complete and compact bar. With efficient,
housekeeperly movements he took out a bottle of Pinchbottle
Haig, another of I. W. Harper’s Bourbon, two pint glasses
that looked like Waterford; a bucket of ice cubes, a siphon
of soda and a flagon of iced water. One by one he placed these
on the desk between his chair and Bond’s. Then, while Bond
poured himself a stiff Bourbon and water with plenty of ice,
he went and sat down across the desk from Bond, reached
for the Haig and said, looking Bond very directly in the eye,
‘I learned who you are from a good friend in the Deuxième
in Paris. He is paid to give me such information when I want
it. I learned it very early this morning. I am in the opposite
camp to yourself—not directly opposite. Let us say at a
tangent on the field.’ He paused. He lifted his glass. He said
with much seriousness, ‘I am now going to establish confidence
with you. By the only means. I am going once again
to place my life in your hands.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He drank. So did Bond. In the filing cabinet, in its icebox,
the hum of the generator broke in on what Bond suddenly
knew was going to be an important moment of truth.
He didn’t know what the truth was going to be. He didn’t
think it was going to be bad. But he had an instinct that, somehow,
perhaps because he had conceived respect and affection
for this man, it was going to mean deep involvement for
himself.</p>

<p class="pindent">The generator stopped.</p>

<p class="pindent">The eyes in the walnut face held his.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I am the head of the Union Corse.’</p>
