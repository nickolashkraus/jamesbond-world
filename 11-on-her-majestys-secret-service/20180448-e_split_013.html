<p class="line7"><span class="sc"><span class="gesp">The next</span></span> day, at London Airport, James Bond, bowler hat,
rolled umbrella, neatly folded <span class="it">Times</span> and all, felt faintly
ridiculous. He felt totally so when he was treated with the
deference due to his title and shown into the VIP lounge
before take-off. At the ticket desk, when he had been addressed
as Sir Hilary, he had looked behind him to see who
the girl was talking to. He really must pull himself together
and damn well <span class="it">be</span> Sir Hilary Bray!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had a double brandy and ginger ale and stood aloof
from the handful of other privileged passengers in the
gracious lounge, trying to <span class="it">feel</span> like a baronet. Then he remembered
the real Sir Hilary Bray, perhaps now gralloching
a hind with his bare hands somewhere up in the Glens.
There was nothing of the baronet about him! He really must
get rid of the inverted snobbery that, with its opposite, is
ingrained in so many of the English! He must stop acting a
part, being a stage nobleman! He would just be himself and,
if he gave the appearance of being rather a rough-hewn
baronet, the easy-going kind, well, that at least was like the
real one up in Scotland. Bond threw down the <span class="it">Times</span> that
he had been carrying as an extra badge of Top Peopleship,
picked up the <span class="it">Daily Express</span>, and asked for another brandy
and ginger ale.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then, with its twin jets whispering far back of the first-class
cabin, the Swissair Caravelle was airborne and Bond’s
mind was reaching forward to the rendezvous that had been
so briefly detailed by the Zürich solicitors. Sir Hilary would
be met at the airport by one of the Comte de Bleuville’s
secretaries. He would be seeing the Count that day or the
next. Bond had a moment of panic. How should he address
the man when he met him? Count? Monsieur le Comte?
No, he would call him nothing—perhaps an occasional
patronizing ‘my dear sir’ in context. What would Blofeld
look like? Would he have changed his appearance much?
Probably, or the fox wouldn’t have kept ahead of the hounds
so efficiently. Bond’s excitement mounted as he consumed a
delicious lunch served by a delicious stewardess, and the
winter-brown chequerboard of France fled backwards
distantly below. Now there was scattered snow and barren
trees as they crossed the tiny hillocks of the Vosges, then
permanent snow and ice-floes on the Rhine, a short stop at
Basle, and then the black criss-cross of Zürich Airport and
‘fasten your lap-straps’ in three languages, and they were
planing down, a slight bump, the roar of jet deflection, and
then they were taxying up to the apron in front of the imposing,
very European-looking buildings decked with the gay
flags of the nations.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the Swissair desk inside the door, a woman was standing
beside the reception counter. As soon as Bond appeared in
the entrance she came forward. ‘Sair Hilary Bray?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I am Fräulein Irma Bunt. Personal secretary to the Count.
Good afternoon. I hope you had a happy flight.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked like a very sunburned female wardress. She
had a square, brutal face with hard yellow eyes. Her smile
was an oblong hole without humour or welcome, and there
were sunburn blisters at the left corner of her mouth which
she licked from time to time with the tip of a pale tongue.
Wisps of brownish grey hair, with a tight, neat bun at the
back, showed from under a skiing hat with a yellow talc
visor that had straps which met under her chin. Her strong,
short body was dressed in unbecomingly tight vorlage
trousers topped by a grey wind-jacket ornamented over the
left breast with a large red G topped by a coronet. Irma la
not so Douce, thought Bond. He said, ‘Yes. It was very
pleasant.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You have your baggage check? Will you follow me, please?
And first your passport. This way.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond followed her through the passport control and out
into the customs hall. There were a few standers-by. Bond
noticed her head nod casually. A man with a brief-case
under his arm, hanging about, moved away. Bond studiously
examined his baggage check. Beyond the scrap of cardboard,
he noticed the man slip into one of the row of telephone
booths in the main hall outside the customs area.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You speak German?’ The tongue flicked out and licked
the blisters.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No, I’m afraid not.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘French perhaps?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A little. Enough for my work.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ah, yes. That is important, yes?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s suitcase was unloaded off the trolley on to the
barrier. The woman flashed some kind of a pass at the
customs officer. It was very quickly done, but Bond caught
a glimpse of her photograph and the heading ‘Bundespolizei’.
So! Blofeld had got the fix in!</p>

<p class="pindent">The officer said deferentially, ‘Bitte sehr,’ and chalked
his symbol in the colour of the day, yellow, on Bond’s suitcase.
A porter took it and they walked across to the entrance.
When they came out on the steps, an anonymous black
Mercedes 300 SE saloon pulled smartly out of the parking
area and slid to a stop beside them. Next to the chauffeur
sat the man who had gone to the telephone. Bond’s suitcase
was put in the boot and they moved off fast in the direction
of Zürich. A few hundred yards down the wide road, the man
beside the driver, who, Bond noticed, had been surreptitiously
watching in the twin driving-mirror, said softly,
‘Is’ gut,’ and the car turned right-handed up a side road
which was marked ‘Eingang Verboten! Mit Ausnahme von
Eigentümer und Personell von Privatflugzeugen’.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was amused as he ticked off the little precautions.
It was obvious that he was still very much on probation.</p>

<p class="pindent">The car came up with the hangars to the left of the main
building, drove slowly between them and pulled up beside a
bright orange Alouette helicopter, adapted by Sud Aviation
for mountain rescue work. But this one had the red G with
the coronet on its fuselage. So! He was going to be taken
for a flight rather than a ride!</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You have travelled in one of these machines before, no?
It is very pleasant. One obtains a fine view of the Alps.’
Fräulein Bunt’s eyes were blank with disinterest. They
climbed up the aluminium ladder. ‘Mind your head, please!’
Bond’s suitcase was handed up by the chauffeur.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a six-seater, luxurious in red leather. Above and
in front of them under his Perspex canopy the pilot lifted
a thumb. The ground staff pulled away the chocks and the
big blades began to move. As they accelerated, the men on
the ground drew away, shielding their faces against the
whirling snow. There was a slight jolt and then they were
climbing fast, and the crackle of radio from the control tower
went silent.</p>

<p class="pindent">Irma Bunt was across the passage-way from Bond. The
extra man was in the rear, hidden behind the <span class="it">Züricher
Zeitung</span>. Bond leaned sideways and said loudly, against the
rattle of the machine, ‘Where are we heading for?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She pretended not to hear. Bond repeated his question,
shouting it.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Into the Alps. Into the high Alps,’ shouted the woman.
She waved towards the window. ‘It is very beautiful. You
like the mountains, isn’t it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I love them,’ shouted Bond. ‘Just like Scotland.’ He
leaned back in his seat, lit a cigarette, and looked out of
the window. Yes, there was the Zürichersee to port. Their
course was more or less east-south-east. They were flying at
about 2,000 feet. And now there was the Wallensee. Bond,
apparently uninterested, took the <span class="it">Daily Express</span> out of his
brief-case and turned to the sports pages. He read the paper
from last page to first, meticulously, every now and then
casting a bored glance out of the window. The big range to
port would be the Rhätikon Alps. That would be the railway
junction of Landquart below them. They held their course
up the valley of the Pratigau. Would they keep on at Klosters
or veer to starboard? Starboard it was. So! Up the Davos
Valley! In a few minutes he would be flying over Tracy!
A casual glance. Yes, there was Davos under its thin canopy
of evening mist and smoke, while, above her, he was still in
bright sunshine. At least she seemed to have had plenty of
snow. Bond remembered the tremendous run down the
Parsenn. Those had been the days! And now back on the
old course again and giant peaks to right and left. This must
be the Engadine. The Silvretta Group away to starboard, to
port Piz Languard and, ahead, the Bernina range diving
down, like a vast ski-jump, into Italy. That forest of lights
away to starboard must be St Moritz! Now where? Bond
buried himself in his paper. A slight veer to port. More
lights. Pontresina? And now the radio began to crackle and
the ‘Seat belts’ sign went up. Bond thought it time to express
open interest. He gazed out. Below, the ground was mostly in
darkness, but ahead the giant peaks were still golden in the
dying sun. They were making straight for one of them, for a
small plateau near its summit. There was a group of buildings
from which golden wires swooped down into the darkness of
the valley. A cable car, spangled in the sun, was creeping
down. Now it had been swallowed up in the murk. The
helicopter was still charging the side of the peak that towered
above them. Now it was only a hundred feet up above the
slope, coming in to the plateau and the buildings. The pilot’s
arms moved on his joy stick. The machine pitched a little
and slowed. The rotor arms swung languidly and then
accelerated as the machine hovered and settled. There came
a slight bump as the inflated rubber ‘floats’ met the snow,
a dying whirr from the rotor and they were there.</p>

<p class="pindent">Where? Bond knew. They were in the Languard range,
somewhere above Pontresina in the Engadine, and their
altitude would be about 10,000 feet. He buttoned up his
raincoat and prepared for the rasping dagger of the cold air
on his lungs when the door was opened.</p>

<p class="pindent">Irma Bunt gave her box-like smile. ‘We have arrived,’
she said unnecessarily.</p>

<p class="pindent">The door, with a clatter of falling ice particles, was
wrenched open. The last rays of the sun shone into the cabin.
They caught the woman’s yellow sun visor and shone
through, turning her face Chinese. The eyes gave out a false
blaze, like the glass eyes of a toy animal, under the light.
‘Mind your head.’ She bent low, her tight, squat behind
inviting an enormous kick, and went down the ladder.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond followed her, holding his breath against the
searing impact of the Arctic, oxygenless air. There were one
or two men standing around dressed like ski-guides. They
looked at Bond with curiosity, but there was no greeting.
Bond went on across the hard-trodden snow in the wake of
the woman, the extra man following with his suitcase. He
heard the engine stutter and roar, and a blizzard of snow
particles stung the right side of his face. Then the iron grasshopper
rose into the air and rattled off into the dusk.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was perhaps fifty yards from where the helicopter had
landed to the group of buildings. Bond dawdled, getting preliminary
bearings. Ahead was a long, low building, now
ablaze with lights. To the right, and perhaps another fifty
yards away, were the outlines of the typical modern cable
railhead, a box-like structure, with a thick flat roof canted
upwards from close to the ground. As Bond examined it, its
lights went out. Presumably the last car had reached the
valley and the line was closed for the night. To the right of
this was a large, bogus-chalet type structure with a vast
veranda, sparsely lit, that would be for the mass tourist trade—again
a typical piece of high-Alpine architecture. Down to
the left, beneath the slope of the plateau, lights shone from a
fourth building that, except for its flat roof, was out of sight.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was now only a few yards from the building that was
obviously his destination. An oblong of yellow opened invitingly
as the woman went in and held the door for him.
The light illuminated a big sign with the red G surmounted
by the coronet. It said <span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">GLORIA KLUB</span></span>. 3605
<span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">METRES, PRIVAT! NUR FÜR MITGLIEDER</span>.</span> Below in smaller letters
it said ‘Alpenberghaus und Restaurant Piz Gloria’, and the
drooping index finger of the traditional hand pointed to the
right, towards the building near the cable-head.</p>

<p class="pindent">So! Piz Gloria! Bond walked into the inviting yellow
oblong. The door, released by the woman, closed with a
pneumatic hiss.</p>

<p class="pindent">Inside it was deliciously warm, almost hot. They were
in a small reception room, and a youngish man with a very
pale crew-cut and shrewd eyes got to his feet from behind a
desk and made a slight bob in their direction. ‘Sir Hilary is
in Number Two.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Weiss schon,’ said the woman curtly and, only just more
politely, to Bond, ‘Follow me, please.’ She went through a
facing door and down a thickly-piled, red-carpeted passage.
The left-hand wall was only occasionally broken by windows
interspersed with fine skiing and mountain photographs.
On the right were at first the doors of the club rooms, marked
Bar, Restaurant, and Toiletten. Then came what were
obviously the doors of bedrooms. Bond was shown into
Number Two. It was an extremely comfortable, chintzy
room in the American motel style with a bathroom leading
off. The broad picture window was now curtained, but Bond
knew that it must offer a tremendous view over the valley
to the Suvretta group above St Moritz. Bond threw his brief-case
on the double bed and gratefully disposed of his bowler
hat and umbrella. The extra man appeared with his suitcase,
placed it on the luggage stand without looking at Bond, and
withdrew, closing the door behind him. The woman stayed
where she was. ‘This is to your satisfaction?’ The yellow
eyes were indifferent to his enthusiastic reply. She had more
to say. ‘That is good. Now perhaps I should explain some
things, convey to you some laws of the club, isn’t it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond lit a cigarette. ‘That would certainly be helpful.’
He put a politely interested expression on his face. ‘Where
are we, for instance?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘In the Alps. In the high Alps,’ said the woman vaguely.
‘This Alp, Piz Gloria, is the property of the Count. Together
with the Gemeinde, the local authorities, he constructed
the Seilbahn. You have seen the cables, yes? This is
the first year it is opened. It is very popular and brings in
much money. There are some fine ski runs. The Gloria
Abfahrt is already famous. There is also a bob-sleigh run
that is much greater than the Cresta at St Moritz. You have
heard of that? You ski perhaps? Or make the bob-sleigh?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The yellow eyes were watchful. Bond thought he would
continue to answer no to all questions. Instinct told him to.
He said apologetically. ‘I’m afraid not. Never got around to
it, you know. Too much bound up with my books, perhaps.’
He smiled, ruefully, self-critically.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Schade! That is a pity.’ But the eyes registered satisfaction.
‘These installations bring good income for the
Count. That is important. It helps to support his life’s work,
the Institut.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond raised his eyebrows a polite fraction.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The Institut für physiologische Forschung. It is for
scientific research. The Count is a leader in the field of
allergies—you understand? This is like the hay fever, the
unableness to eat shellfish, yes?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh really? Can’t say I suffer from any myself.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No? The laboratories are in a separate building. There
the Count also lives. In this building, where we are, live
the patients. He asks that you will not disturb them with
too many questions. These treatments are very delicate. You
understand?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, of course. And when may I see the Count? I’m
afraid I am a very busy man, Fräulein Bunt. There are
matters awaiting my attention in London.’ Bond spoke impressively.
‘The new African States. Much work has to be
done on their flags, the design of their currency, their
stamps, their medals. We are very short-handed at the
College. I hope the Count understands that his personal
problem, interesting and important though it is, must take
second place to the problems of Government.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had got through. Now she was all eagerness, reassurance.
‘But of course, my dear Sair Hilary. The Count
asks to be excused tonight, but he would much like to receive
you at eleven o’clock tomorrow morning. That is suitable?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Certainly, certainly. That will give me time to marshal
my documents, my books. Perhaps’—Bond waved to the
small writing-desk near the window—‘I could have an extra
table to lay these things out. I’m afraid’—Bond smiled
deprecatingly—‘we bookworms need a lot of space.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course, Sair Hilary. It will be done at once.’ She
moved to the door and pressed a bell-button. She gestured
downwards, now definitely embarrassed. ‘You will have
noticed that there is no door handle on this side?’ (Bond
had done so. He said he hadn’t.) ‘You will ring when you
wish to leave the room. Yes? It is on account of the patients.
It is necessary that they have quiet. It is difficult to prevent
them visiting each other for the sake of gossiping. It is for
their good. You understand? Bed-time is at ten o’clock. But
there is a night staff in case you should need any service.
And the doors are of course not locked. You may re-enter
your room at any time. Yes? We meet for cocktails in the bar
at six. It is—how do you say?—the rest-pause of the day.’
The box-like smile made its brief appearance. ‘My girls
are much looking forward to meeting you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The door opened. It was one of the men dressed as guides,
a swarthy, bull-necked man with brown Mediterranean eyes.
One of Marc-Ange’s Corsican defectors? In rapid, bad
French, the woman said that another table was desired. This
was to be furnished during dinner. The man said ‘Entendu.’
She held the door before he could close it and he went off
down the passage to the right. Guards’ quarters at the end of
the passage? Bond’s mind went on clicking up the clues.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Then that is all for the present, Sair Hilary? The post
leaves at midday. We have radio telephone communications
if you wish to use them. May I convey any message to the
Count?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Please say that I look forward greatly to meeting him
tomorrow. Until six o’clock then.’ Bond suddenly wanted to
be alone with his thoughts. He gestured towards his suitcase.
‘I must get myself unpacked.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course, of course, Sair Hilary. Forgive me for detaining
you.’ And, on this gracious note, Irma Bunt closed the door,
with its decisive click, behind her.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stood still in the middle of the room. He let out his
breath with a quiet hiss. What the hell of a kettle of fish!
He would have liked to kick one of the dainty bits of furniture
very hard indeed. But he had noticed that, of the four electric
light prisms in the ceiling, one was a blank, protruding eyeball.
Closed-circuit television? If so, what would be its
range? Not much more than a wide circle covering the centre
of the room. Microphones? Probably the whole expanse of
ceiling was one. That was the war-time gimmick. He must,
he simply must assume that he was under constant supervision.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond, his thoughts racing, proceeded to unpack,
take a shower, and make himself presentable for ‘my girls’.</p>
