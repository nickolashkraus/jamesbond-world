<p class="line7"><span class="sc"><span class="gesp">With the</span></span> Walther PPK in its leather holster warm against
his stomach and his own name in his passport, James Bond
looked out of the window at the English Channel sliding
away beneath the belly of the Caravelle and felt more like his
old, his pre-Sir Hilary Bray, self.</p>

<p class="pindent">He glanced at the new Rolex on his wrist—the shops were
still shut and he had had to blarney it out of Q Branch—and
guessed they would be on time, 6 pm at Marseilles. It
had been the hell of a rush to get off. He had worked until
late in the night at HQ and all that morning, setting up the
Identicast of Blofeld, checking details with Ronnie Vallance,
fixing up the private, the Munich side of his life, chattering
on the teleprinter to Station Z, even remembering to tell Mary
Goodnight to get on to Sable Basilisk after the holiday and
ask him to please do some kind of a job on the surnames of
the ten girls and please to have the family tree of Ruby
Windsor embellished with gold capitals.</p>

<p class="pindent">At midnight he had called Tracy in Munich and heard her
darling, excited voice. ‘I’ve got the toothbrush, James,’ she
had said, ‘and a pile of books. Tomorrow I’m going to go up
the Zugspitze and sit in the sun so as to look pretty for you.
Guess what I had for dinner tonight in my room! Krebsschwänze
mit Dilltunke. That’s crayfish tails with rice and a
cream and dill sauce. And Rehrücken mit Sahne. That’s
saddle of roebuck with a smitane sauce. I bet it was better
than what you had.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I had two ham sandwiches with stacks of mustard and
half a pint of Harper’s Bourbon on the rocks. The bourbon
was better than the ham. Now listen, Tracy, and stop blowing
down the telephone.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I was only sighing with love.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, you must have got a Force Five sigh. Now listen.
I’m posting my birth certificate to you tomorrow with a
covering letter to the British Consul saying I want to get
married to you as soon as possible. Look, you’re going up to
Force Ten! For God’s sake pay attention. It’ll take a few
days, I’m afraid. They have to post the banns or something.
He’ll tell you all about it. Now, you must quickly get your
birth certificate and give it to him, too. Oh, you have, have
you?’ Bond laughed. ‘So much the better. Then we’re all set.
I’ve got three days or so of work to do and I’m going down
to see your father tomorrow and ask for your hand, both of
them, and the feet and all the rest, in marriage. No, you’re to
stay where you are. This is men’s talk. Will he be awake?
I’m going to ring him up now. Good. Well, now you go off to
sleep or you’ll be too tired to say “Yes” when the time comes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They had not wanted to let go of each other’s voices, but
finally the last goodnight, the last kiss, had been exchanged,
and Bond called the Marseilles number of Appareils Électriques
Draco, and Marc-Ange’s voice, almost as excited as
Tracy’s, was on the line. Bond dampened down the raptures
about the ‘fiançailles’ and said, ‘Now listen, Marc-Ange.
I want you to give me a wedding present.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Anything, my dear James. Anything I possess.’ He
laughed. ‘And perhaps certain things of which I could take
possession. What is it you would like?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ll tell you tomorrow evening. I’m booked on the afternoon
Air France to Marseilles. Will you have someone meet
me? And it’s business, I’m afraid. So could you have your
other directors present for a little meeting? We shall need all
our brains. It is about our sales organization in Switzerland.
Something drastic needs to be done about it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Aha!’ There was full understanding in the voice. ‘Yes,
it is indeed a bad spot on our sales map. I will certainly have
my colleagues available. And I assure you, my dear James,
that anything that can be done will be done. And of course
you will be met. I shall perhaps not be there in person—it is
very cold out these winter evenings. But I shall see that you
are properly looked after. Goodnight, my dear fellow. Goodnight.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The line had gone dead. The old fox! Had he thought
Bond might commit an indiscretion, or had he got fitted to
his telephone a ‘bug-meter’, the delicate instrument that
measures the resonance on the line and warns of listening-in?</p>

<p class="pindent">The winter sun spread a last orange glow over the thick
overcast 10,000 feet below the softly whistling plane and
switched itself off for the night.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond dozed, reflecting that he must somehow, and pretty
soon, find a way of catching up on his sleep.</p>

<p class="line10">*          *          *</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a stage-type Marseilles taxi-driver to meet
Bond—the archetype of all Mariuses, with the face of a pirate
and the razor-sharp badinage of the lower French music-halls.
He was apparently known and enjoyed by everyone at
the airport, and Bond was whisked through the formalities
in a barrage of wisecracks about ‘le milord anglais’, which
made Marius, for his name turned out in fact to be Marius,
the centre of attraction and Bond merely his butt, the dim-witted
English tourist. But, once in the taxi, Marius made
curt, friendly apologies over his shoulder. ‘I ask your pardon
for my bad manners.’ His French had suddenly purified
itself of all patois. It also smelt like acetylene gas. ‘I was told
to extract you from the airport with the least possible limelight
directed upon you. I know all those “flics” and douaniers.
They all know me. If I had not been myself, the cab-driver
they know as Marius, if I had shown deference, eyes, inquisitive
eyes, would have been upon you, mon Commandant,
I did what I thought best. You forgive me?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course I do, Marius. But you shouldn’t have been so
funny. You nearly made me laugh. That would have been
fatal.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You understand our talk here?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Enough of it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So!’ There was a pause. Then Marius said, ‘Alas, since
Waterloo, one can never underestimate the English.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, seriously, ‘The same date applied to the French.
It was a near thing.’ This was getting too gallant. Bond said,
‘Now tell me, is the bouillabaisse chez Guido always as
good?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It is passable,’ said Marius. ‘But this is a dish that is
dead, gone. There is no more true bouillabaisse, because
there is no more fish in the Mediterranean. For the bouillabaisse,
you must have the rascasse, the tender flesh of the
scorpion fish. Today they just use hunks of morue. The
saffron and the garlic, they are always the same. But you
could eat pieces of a woman soaked in those and it would be
good. Go to any of the little places down by the harbour.
Eat the plat du jour and drink the vin du Cassis that they
give you. It will fill your stomach as well as it fills the fishermen’s.
The toilette will be filthy. What does that matter?
You are a man. You can walk up the Canebière and do it at
the Noailles for nothing after lunch.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They were now weaving expertly through the traffic down
the famous Canebière and Marius needed all his breath to
insult the other drivers. Bond could smell the sea. The
accordions were playing in the cafés. He remembered old
times in this most criminal and tough of all French towns.
He reflected that it was rather fun, this time, being on the
side of the devil.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the bottom of the Canebière, where it crosses the Rue
de Rome, Marius turned right and then left into the Rue
St Ferréol, only a long stone’s throw from the Quai des
Belges and the Vieux Port. The lights from the harbour’s
entrance briefly winked at them and then the taxi drew up
at a hideous, but very new apartment house with a broad
vitrine on the ground floor, which announced in furious
neon ‘Appareils Électriques Draco’. The well-lit interior of
the store contained what you would expect—television sets,
radios, gramophones, electric irons, fans, and so forth. Marius
very quickly carried Bond’s suitcase across the pavement
and through the swing doors beside the vitrine. The close-carpeted
hallway was more luxurious than Bond had expected.
A man came out of the porter’s lodge beside the lift
and wordlessly took the suitcase. Marius turned to Bond,
gave him a smile and a wink and a bone-crushing handshake,
said curtly, ‘A la prochaine,’ and hurried out. The
porter stood beside the open door of the lift. Bond noticed
the bulge under his right arm and, out of curiosity, brushed
against the man as he entered the lift. Yes, and something
big too, a real stopper. The man gave Bond a bored look, as
much as to say, ‘Clever? Eh?’ and pressed the top button.
The porter’s twin, or very nearly his twin—dark, chunky,
brown-eyed, fit—was waiting at the top floor. He took
Bond’s suitcase and led the way down a corridor, close-carpeted
and with wall brackets in good taste. He opened a
door. It was an extremely comfortable bedroom with a bathroom
leading off. Bond imagined that the big picture window,
now curtained, would have a superb view of the harbour.
The man put down his suitcase and said, ‘Monsieur Draco
est immédiatement à votre disposition.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond thought it time to make some show of independence.
He said firmly, ‘Un moment, je vous en prie,’ and went into
the bathroom and cleaned himself up—amused to notice
that the soap was that most English of soaps, Pears Transparent,
and that there was a bottle of Mr Trumper’s ‘Eucris’
beside the very masculine brush and comb by Kent. Marc-Ange
was indeed making his English guest feel at home!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took his time, then went out and followed the man
to the end door. The man opened it without knocking and
closed it behind Bond. Marc-Ange, his creased walnut face
split by his great golden-toothed smile, got up from his desk
(Bond was getting tired of desks!), trotted across the broad
room, threw his arms round Bond’s neck and kissed him
squarely on both cheeks. Bond suppressed his recoil and
gave a reassuring pat to Marc-Ange’s broad back. Marc-Ange
stood away and laughed. ‘All right! I swear never to
do it again. It is once and for ever. Yes? But it had to come
out—from the Latin temperament, isn’t it? You forgive me?
Good. Then come and take a drink’—he waved at a loaded
sideboard—‘and sit down and tell me what I can do for you.
I swear not to talk about Teresa until you have finished with
your business. But tell me’—the brown eyes pleaded—‘it
is all right between you? You have not changed your mind?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled. ‘Of course not, Marc-Ange. And everything
is arranged. We will be married within the week. At the
Consulate in Munich. I have two weeks’ leave. I thought we
might spend the honeymoon in Kitzbühel. I love that place.
So does she. You will come to the wedding?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Come to the wedding!’ Marc-Ange exploded. ‘You will
have a time keeping me away from Kitzbühel. Now then’—he
waved at the sideboard—‘take your drink while I compose
myself. I must stop being happy and be clever instead. My
two best men, my organizers if you like, are waiting. I
wanted to have you for a moment to myself.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond poured himself a stiff Jack Daniel’s sourmash bourbon
on the rocks and added some water. He walked over to
the desk and took the right-hand of the three chairs that had
been arranged in a semicircle facing the ‘Capu’. ‘I wanted
that too, Marc-Ange. Because there are some things I must
tell you which affect my country. I have been granted leave
to tell them to you, but they must remain, as you put it,
behind the Herkos Odonton—behind the hedge of your teeth.
Is that all right?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Marc-Ange lifted his right hand and crossed his heart,
slowly, deliberately, with his forefinger. His face was now
deadly serious, almost cruelly implacable. He leaned forward
and rested his forearms on the desk. ‘Continue.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond told him the whole story, not even omitting his
passage with Ruby. He had developed much love, and total
respect, for this man. He couldn’t say why. It was partly
animal magnetism and partly that Marc-Ange had so opened
his heart to Bond, so completely trusted him with his own
innermost secrets.</p>

<p class="pindent">Marc-Ange’s face remained impassive throughout. Only
his quick, animal eyes flickered continually across Bond’s
face. When Bond had finished, Marc-Ange sat back. He
reached for a blue packet of Gauloises, fixed one in the
corner of his mouth and talked through the blue clouds of
smoke that puffed continuously out through his lips, as if
somewhere inside him there was a small steam-engine. ‘Yes,
it is indeed a dirty business. It must be finished with,
destroyed, and the man too. My dear James’—the voice was
sombre—‘I am a criminal, a great criminal. I run houses,
chains of prostitutes, I smuggle, I sell protection, whenever
I can, I steal from the very rich. I break many laws and I
have often had to kill in the process. Perhaps one day,
perhaps very soon, I shall reform. But it is difficult to step
down from being Capu of the Union. Without the protection
of my men, my life would not be worth much. However, we
shall see. But this Blofeld, he is too bad, too disgusting. You
have come to ask the Union to make war on him, to destroy
him. You need not answer. I know it is so. This is something
that cannot be done officially. Your Chief is correct.
You would get nowhere with the Swiss. You wish me and
my men to do the job.’ He smiled suddenly. ‘That is the
wedding present you talked of. Yes?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s right, Marc-Ange. But I’ll do my bit. I’ll be there
too. I want this man for myself.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Marc-Ange looked at him thoughtfully. ‘That I do not
like. And you know why I do not like it.’ He said mildly,
‘You are a bloody fool, James. You are already lucky to be
alive.’ He shrugged. ‘But I am wasting my breath. You
started on a long road after this man. And you want to come
to the end of it. Is that right?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s right. I don’t want someone else to shoot my fox.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘OK, OK. We bring in the others, yes? They will not
need to know the reason why. My orders are my orders.
But we all need to know <span class="it">how</span> we are to bring this about. I
have some ideas. I think it can be done and swiftly done. But
it must also be well done, cleanly done. There must be no
untidiness about this thing.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Marc-Ange picked up his telephone and spoke into it. A
minute later the door opened and two men came in and,
with hardly a glance at Bond, took the other two chairs.</p>

<p class="pindent">Marc-Ange nodded at the one next to Bond, a great ox
of a man with the splayed ears and broken nose of a boxer
or wrestler. ‘This is Ché-Ché—Ché-Ché le Persuadeur.
And’—Marc-Ange smiled grimly—‘he is very adept at
persuading.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got a glimpse of two hard yellow-brown eyes that
looked at him quickly, reluctantly, and then went back to the
Capu, ‘Plaisir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And this is Toussaint, otherwise known as “Le Pouff”.
He is our expert with le plastique. We shall need plenty of
plastique.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We shall indeed,’ said Bond, ‘with pretty quick time-pencils.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Toussaint leaned forward to show himself. He was thin
and grey-skinned, with an almost fine Phoenician profile
pitted with smallpox. Bond guessed that he was on heroin,
but not as a mainliner. He gave Bond a brief, conspiratorial
smile. ‘Plaisir.’ He sat back.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And this’—Marc-Ange gestured at Bond—‘is my friend.
My absolute friend. He is simply “Le Commandant”. And
now to business.’ He had been speaking in French, but he
now broke into rapid Corsican which, apart from a few
Italian and French roots, was incomprehensible to Bond. At
one period he drew a large-scale map of Switzerland out of a
drawer of his desk, spread it out, searched with his finger,
and pointed to a spot in the centre of the Engadine. The two
men craned forward, examined the map carefully and then
sat back. Ché-Ché said something which contained the word
Strasbourg and Marc-Ange nodded enthusiastically. He
turned to Bond and handed him a large sheet of paper and a
pencil. ‘Be a good chap and get to work on this, would you?
A map of the Gloria buildings, with approximate sizes and
distances from each other. Later we will do a complete
maquette in plasticine so that there is no confusion. Every
man will have his job to do’—he smiled—‘like the commandos
in the war. Yes?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond bent to his task while the others talked. The telephone
rang. Marc-Ange picked it up. He jotted down a few
words and rang off. He turned to Bond, his eyes momentarily
suspicious. ‘It is a telegram for me from London signed
Universal. It says, “The birds have assembled in the town
and all fly tomorrow.” What is this, my friend?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond kicked himself for his forgetfulness. ‘I’m sorry,
Marc-Ange. I meant to tell you you might get a signal like
that. It means that the girls are in Zürich and are flying to
England tomorrow. It is very good news. It was important
to have them out of the way.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ah, good! Very good indeed! That is fine news. And you
were quite right not to have the telegram addressed to you.
You are not supposed to be here or to know me at all. It is
better so.’ He fired some more Corsican at the two men.
They nodded their understanding.</p>

<p class="pindent">After that, the meeting soon broke up. Marc-Ange
examined Bond’s handiwork and passed it over to Toussaint.
The man glanced at the sketch and folded it as if it were a
valuable share-certificate. With short bows in Bond’s direction,
the two men left the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">Marc-Ange sat back with a sigh of satisfaction. ‘It goes
well,’ he said. ‘The whole team will receive good danger
money. And they love a good rough fight. And they are
pleased that I am coming to lead them.’ He laughed slyly.
‘They are less certain of you, my dear James. They say you
will get in the way. I had to tell them that you could outshoot
and outfight the lot of them. When I say something
like that, they have to believe me. I have never let them down
yet. I hope I am right?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Please don’t try me,’ said Bond. ‘I’ve never taken on a
Corsican and I don’t want to start now.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Marc-Ange was delighted. ‘You might win with guns.
But not in close combat. They are pigs, my men. Great pigs.
The greatest. I am taking five of the best. With you and me
that is seven. How many did you say there are on the
mountain?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘About eight. And the big one.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ah yes, the big one,’ said Marc-Ange reflectively. ‘That
is one that must not get away.’ He got up. ‘And now, my
friend, I have ordered dinner, a good dinner, to be served
us up here. And then we will go to bed stinking of garlic and,
perhaps, just a little bit drunk. Yes?’</p>

<p class="pindent">From his heart Bond said, ‘I can’t think of anything
better.’</p>
