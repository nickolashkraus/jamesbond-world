<p class="line7"><span class="sc"><span class="gesp">They had</span></span> coffee in M’s study and smoked the thin black
cheroots of which M allowed himself two a day. Bond
burnt his tongue on his. M continued with his stories about
the Navy which Bond could listen to all day—stories of
battles, tornadoes, bizarre happenings, narrow shaves, courts
martial, eccentric officers, neatly-worded signals, as when
Admiral Somerville, commanding the battleship <span class="it">Queen
Elizabeth</span>, had passed the liner <span class="it">Queen Elizabeth</span> in mid-Atlantic
and had signalled the one word ‘SNAP’! Perhaps
it was all just the stuff of boys’ adventure books, but it was
all true and it was about a great navy that was no more and
a great breed of officers and seamen that would never be seen
again.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was three o’clock. A car’s wheels scrunched on the
gravel outside. Dusk was already creeping into the room.
M got up and switched on the lights and Bond arranged two
more chairs up against the desk. M said, ‘That’ll be 501.
You’ll have come across him. Head of the Scientific Research
Section. And a man called Franklin from the Ministry of
Agriculture. 501 says he’s the top on his subject—Pest
Control. Don’t know why Ag. and Fish. chose to send him in
particular, but the Minister told me they’ve got a bit of
trouble on their hands, wouldn’t tell even me what it is, and
they think you may have run into something pretty big.
We’ll let them have a look at your report and see what they
make of it. All right?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The door opened and the two men came in.</p>

<p class="pindent">Number 501 of the Secret Service, whose name Bond
remembered was Leathers, was a big-boned, rangy man with
the stoop and thick spectacles of the stage scientist. He had a
pleasant, vague smile and no deference, but only politeness,
towards M. He was appropriately dressed in shaggy tweeds
and his knitted woollen tie didn’t cover his collar stud. The
other man was small and brisk and keen-looking, with darting,
amused eyes. As became a senior representative of a
Ministry who had received his orders from his Minister in
person and who knew nothing of Secret Services, he had put
on a neat dark-blue pin-stripe and a stiff white collar. His
black shoes gleamed efficiently. So did the leather of his fat
brief-case. His greeting was reserved, neutral. He wasn’t
quite sure where he was or what this was all about. He was
going to smell his way carefully in this business, be wary of
what he said and how far he committed his Ministry. Of
such, Bond reflected, is ‘Government’.</p>

<p class="pindent">When the appropriate greetings and apologies for disturbed
Christmases had been made, and they were in their
chairs, M said, ‘Mr Franklin, if you’ll forgive my saying so,
everything you are going to see and hear in this room is
subject to the Official Secrets Act. You will no doubt be in
possession of many secret matters affecting your own
Ministry. I would be grateful if you would respect those of
the Ministry of Defence. May I ask you to discuss what you
are about to hear only with your Minister personally?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Franklin made a little bow of acquiescence. ‘My
Minister has already instructed me accordingly. My particular
duties in the Ministry have accustomed me to handling
Top Secret matters. You need have no reservations in what
you tell me. Now then’—the amused eyes rested on each of
the other three in turn—‘perhaps you can tell me what this
is all about. I know practically nothing except that a man
on top of an alp is making efforts to improve our agriculture
and livestock. Very decent of him. So why are we treating
him as if he had stolen atomic secrets?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He did once, as a matter of fact,’ said M drily. ‘I think
the best course would be for you and Mr Leathers to read
the report of my representative here. It contains code
numbers and other obscure references which need not concern
you. The story tells itself without them.’ M handed
Bond’s report to 501. ‘Most of this will be new to you also.
Perhaps you would like to read a page at a time and then
pass them on to Mr Franklin.’</p>

<p class="pindent">A long silence fell in the room. Bond looked at his fingernails
and listened to the rain on the window panes and the
soft noises of the fire. M sat hunched up, apparently in a
doze. Bond lit a cigarette. The rasp of his Ronson caused
M’s eyes to open lazily and then close again. 501 passed
across the last page and sat back. Franklin finished his reading,
shuffled the pages together, and stacked them neatly in front of
him. He looked at Bond and smiled. ‘You’re lucky to be here.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled back but said nothing.</p>

<p class="pindent">M turned to 501. ‘Well?’</p>

<p class="pindent">501 took off his thick spectacles and polished them on a
none too clean handkerchief. ‘I don’t get the object of the
exercise, sir. It seems perfectly above-board—praiseworthy,
in fact, if we didn’t know what we do know about Blofeld.
Technically, what he has done is this. He has obtained ten,
or rather eleven, counting the one that’s left the place,
suitable subjects for deep hypnosis. These are all simple
girls from the country. It is significant that the one called
Ruby had failed her GCE twice. They seem to suffer, and
there’s no reason to believe that they don’t, from certain
fairly common forms of allergy. We don’t know the origins
of their allergies and these are immaterial. They are probably
psychosomatic—the adverse reaction to birds is a very
common one, as is the one brought on by cattle. The reactions
to crops and plants are less common. Blofeld appears
to be attempting cures of these allergies by hypnosis, and not
only cures, but a pronounced affinity with the cause of the
allergy in place of the previous repulsion. In the case of
Ruby, for instance, she is told, in the words of the report, to
“love” chickens, to wish to “improve their breed” and so
forth. The mechanical means of the cure are, in practice,
simple. In the twilight stage, on the edge of sleep—the sharp
ringing of the bell would waken those who were already
asleep—the use of the metronome exactly on the pulse-beat,
and the distant whirring noise, are both common
hypnotic aids. The singsong, authoritative murmur is the
usual voice of the hypnotist. We have no knowledge of what
lectures these girls attended or what reading they did, but we
can assume that these were merely additional means to
influence the mind in the path desired by Blofeld. Now,
there is plenty of medical evidence for the efficacy of hypnosis.
There are well-authenticated cases of the successful treatment
by these means of such stubborn disabilities as warts,
certain types of asthma, bed-wetting, stammering, and even
alcoholism, drugtaking, and homosexual tendencies. Although
the British Medical Association frowns officially on
the practitioners of hypnosis, you would be surprised, sir, to
know how many doctors themselves, as a last resort, particularly
in cases of alcoholism, have private treatment from
qualified hypnotists. But this is by the way. All I can contribute
to this discussion is that Blofeld’s ideas are not new
and that they can be completely efficacious.’</p>

<p class="pindent">M nodded. ‘Thank you, Mr Leathers. Now would you
like to be unscientific and hazard any wild guesses that would
contribute in any way to what you have told us?’ M smiled
briefly. ‘You will not be quoted, I can assure you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">501 ran a worried hand through his hair. ‘Well, sir, it may
be nonsense, but a train of thought came to me as I read the
report. This is a very expensive set-up of Blofeld’s. Whether
his intentions are benign or malignant, and I must say that I
think we can accept them as being malignant, who is paying
for all this? How did he fall upon this particular field of
research and find the finance for it? Well, sir, this may
sound fanciful, looking for burglars under the bed, so to
speak, but the leaders in this field, ever since Pavlov and his
salivating dogs, have been the Russians. If you recall, sir,
at the time of the first human orbiting of the earth by the
Russians, I put in a report on the physiology of the astronaut
Yuri Gagarin. I drew attention to the simple nature of this
man, his equable temperament when faced with his hysterical
welcome in London. This equability never failed him and,
if you will remember, we kept him under discreet observation
throughout his visit and on his subsequent tours abroad,
at the request of the Atomic Energy authorities. That bland,
smiling face, sir, those wide-apart, innocent eyes, the
extreme psychological simplicity of the man, all added up,
as I said in my report, to the perfect subject for hypnosis,
and I hazarded the guess that, in the extremely complicated
movements required of him in his space capsule, Gagarin
was operating throughout in a state of deep hypnosis. All
right, sir’—501 made a throw-away gesture of his hand—‘my
conclusions were officially regarded as fanciful. But,
since you ask, I now repeat them, and I throw out the suggestion
that the Power behind Blofeld in all this may well be
the Russians.’ He turned to Bond. ‘Was there any sign of
Russian inspiration or guidance at this Gloria place? Any
Russians anywhere in the offing?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, there was this man, Captain Boris. I never saw
him, but he was certainly a Russian. Otherwise nothing I can
think of except the three <span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">SPECTRE</span></span> men who I’d guess were
ex-Smersh. But they seemed definitely staff men, what the
Americans would call “mechanics”.’</p>

<p class="pindent">501 shrugged. He said to M, ‘Well, I’m afraid that’s all
I can contribute, sir. But, if you come to the conclusion that
this is dirty business, for my money, this Captain Boris was
either the paymaster or supervisor of the scheme and Blofeld
the independent operator. It would fit in with the free-lance
character of the old <span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">SPECTRE</span></span>—an independent gang working
for whoever was willing to pay them.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Perhaps you’ve got something there, Mr Leathers,’ said
M reflectively. ‘But what the devil’s the object of the exercise?’
He turned to Franklin. ‘Well now, Mr Franklin, what
do <span class="it">you</span> think of all this?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The man from Ag. and Fish. had lit a small, highly
polished pipe. He kept it between his teeth and reached down
for his brief-case and took out some papers. From among
them he extracted a black and white outline map of Britain
and Eire and smoothed it down across the desk. The map
was dotted with symbols, forests of them here, blank spaces
there. He said, ‘This is a map showing the total agricultural
and livestock resources of Britain and Eire, leaving out grassland
and timber. Now, at my first sight of the report, I admit
I was completely confused. As Mr Leathers said, these
experiments seem perfectly harmless—more than that, to
use his word, praiseworthy. But’—Franklin smiled—‘you
gentlemen are concerned with searching for the dark side of
the moon. I adjusted my mind accordingly. The result was
that I am filled with a very deep and terrible suspicion. Perhaps
these black thoughts have entered my mind by a process
of osmosis with the present company’s way of looking at the
world’—he looked deprecatingly at M—‘but I also have one
piece of evidence which may be decisive. Excuse me, but
there was one sheet of paper missing from the report—the
list of the girls and their addresses. Is that available?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took the photostat out of his inside pocket. ‘Sorry.
I didn’t want to clutter up the report too much.’ He slipped
it across the table to Franklin.</p>

<p class="pindent">Franklin ran his eyes down it. Then he said, and there
was awe in his voice, ‘I’ve got it! I do believe I’ve got it!’
He sat back heavily in his chair as if he couldn’t believe what
he had seen.</p>

<p class="pindent">The three men watched him tensely, believing him,
because of what was written on his face—waiting for it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Franklin took a red pencil out of his breast pocket and
leaned over the map. Glancing from time to time at the
list, he made a series of red circles at seemingly unrelated
points across Britain and Eire, but Bond noticed that they
covered the areas where the forests of symbols were at their
densest. As he made the circles he commented, Aberdeen—Aberdeen
Angus, Devon—Red Poll, Lancashire—poultry,
Kent—fruit, Shannon—potatoes,’ until ten red circles stood
out on the map. Finally he poised his pencil over East Anglia
and made a big cross. He looked up, said ‘Turkeys’ and
threw his pencil down.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the silence that followed, M said, rather testily, ‘Well,
Mr Franklin, what have you in mind?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The man from Ag. and Fish. had no intention of being
pushed about by someone, however grand and hush-hush,
from another Ministry. He bent and dug again into his
brief-case. He came up with several papers. He selected one,
a newspaper cutting. He said, ‘I don’t expect you gentlemen
have time to read much of the agricultural news in the paper,
but this is from the <span class="it">Daily Telegraph</span> of early December. I
won’t read it all. It’s from their agricultural correspondent,
good man by the name of Thomas. These are the headlines:
“CONCERN OVER TURKEYS. FLOCKS RAVAGED
BY FOWL PEST”. Then it goes on: “Supplies of turkeys
to the Christmas market may be hit by recent fowl pest
outbreaks which have resulted in large numbers of birds
being slaughtered . . .” and further down, “Figures available
show that 218,000 birds have been slaughtered . . . last year,
total supplies for the Christmas market were estimated at
between 3,700,000 and 4,000,000 birds, so much will depend
now on the extent of further fowl pest outbreaks.” ’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Franklin put the cutting down. He said seriously,
‘That news was only the tip of the iceberg. We managed to
keep later details out of the press. But I can tell you this,
gentlemen. Within the past four weeks or so we have
slaughtered three million turkeys. And that’s only the
beginning of it. Fowl pest is running wild in East Anglia
and there are also signs of it in Hampshire, where a lot of
turkey-raising goes on. What you ate at lunch today was
almost certainly a foreign bird. We allowed the import of two
million from America to cover this position up.’</p>

<p class="pindent">M said sourly, ‘Well, so far as I’m concerned, I don’t
care if I never eat another turkey again. However, I see
you’ve had quite a problem on your hands. But to get back
to our case. Where do we go from turkeys?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Franklin was not amused. He said, ‘We have one clue.
All the birds that died first were exhibited at the National
Poultry Show at Olympia early this month. Olympia had
been cleared and cleaned out for the next exhibition before
we had reached that conclusion, and we could find no trace
on the premises of the virus—Fowl Pest is a virus, by the
way, highly infectious, with a mortality of one hundred per
cent. Now then’—he held up a stout white pamphlet with the
insignia of the United States on it—‘how much do you
gentlemen know about Biological Warfare?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leathers said, ‘We were indirectly concerned in the fringes
of the subject during the war. But in the end neither side
used it. Around 1944 the Americans had a plan for destroying
the whole of the Japanese rice crop by the use of aerial
sprays. But, as I recall, Roosevelt vetoed the idea.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Right,’ said Franklin. ‘Dead right. But the subject is still
very much alive. And very much so in my Ministry. We
happen to be the most highly agriculturalized country in the
world. We had to make ourselves so during the war to keep
ourselves from starvation. So, in theory, we would be an
ideal target for an attack of this kind.’ He slowly brought
his hands down on the table for emphasis. ‘I don’t think it
would be too much to say, gentlemen, that if such an attack
could be launched, and it can only be countered by slaughtering
the poultry and animals and burning the crops, we would
be a bankrupt country within a matter of months. We
would literally be down on our knees, begging for bread!’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Never thought of that,’ said M reflectively, ‘but it seems
to make sense.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now this,’ continued Franklin, holding up the pamphlet,
‘is the latest thinking on the subject by our friends in
America. It also covers Chemical and Radiological Warfare,
but we’re not concerned with those—CW, BW, and RW
they call them. It’s a United States Senate paper, Number
58991, dated August 29th, 1960, prepared by “The Subcommittee
on Disarmament of the Committee on Foreign
Relations”. My Ministry goes along with the general findings
on BW, with the reservation that America is a vast country
and we are a very small and tightly-packed one. BW would
hit us a thousand times harder than it would hit the States.
May I read you a few extracts?’</p>

<p class="pindent">M positively loathed the problems of other Ministries.
In the end, on the Intelligence side, they all ended up on his
plate. Bond, amused, watched him summon an expression of
polite interest. ‘Go ahead, Mr Franklin.’</p>
