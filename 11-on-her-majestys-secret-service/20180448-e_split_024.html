<p class="line7"><span class="sc"><span class="gesp">Bond slept</span></span> in the plane and was visited by a terrible
nightmare. It was the hallway of a very grand town-house,
an embassy perhaps, and a wide staircase led up under a
spangled chandelier to where the butler was standing at the
door of the drawing-room, from which came the murmur of a
large crowd of guests. Tracy, in oyster satin, was on his arm.
She was loaded with jewels and her golden hair had been
piled up grandly into one of those fancy arrangements you
see in smart hairdressers’ advertisements. On top of the
pile was a diamond tiara that glittered gorgeously. Bond was
dressed in tails (where in hell had he got <span class="it">those</span> from?),
and the wing collar stuck into his neck below the chin. He
was wearing his medals, and his order as CMG, on its blue
and scarlet ribbon, hung below his white tie. Tracy was
chattering, gaily, excitedly, looking forward to the grand
evening. Bond was cursing the prospect before him and
wishing he was playing a tough game of bridge for high
stakes at Blades. They got to the top of the stairs and Bond
gave his name.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Commander and Mrs James Bond!’ It was the stentorian
bellow of a toast-master. Bond got the impression that a
sudden hush fell over the elegant crowd in the gilt and white
drawing-room.</p>

<p class="pindent">He followed Tracy through the double doors. There was a
gush of French from Tracy as she exchanged those empty
‘Mayfair’ kisses, that end up wide of the kissers’ ears, with
her hostess. Tracy drew Bond forward. ‘And this is James.
Doesn’t he look sweet with that beautiful medal round his
neck? Just like the old De Reszke cigarette advertisements!’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Fasten your seat belts, please, and extinguish your
cigarettes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond awoke, sweating. God Almighty! What had he
done? But no! It wouldn’t be like that! Definitely not. He
would still have his tough, exciting life, but now there would
be Tracy to come home to. Would there be room in his flat
in Chelsea? Perhaps he could rent the floor above. And what
about May, his Scottish treasure? That would be tricky. He
must somehow persuade her to stay.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Caravelle hit the runway and there came the roar of
jet deflection, and then they were trundling over the tarmac
in a light drizzle. Bond suddenly realized that he had no
luggage, that he could go straight to Passport Control and
then out and back to his flat to change out of these ridiculous
skiing clothes that stank of sweat. Would there be a car
from the pool for him? There was, with Miss Mary Goodnight
sitting beside the driver.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My God, Mary, this is a hell of a way to spend your
Christmas! This is far beyond the line of duty. Anyway, get
in the back and tell me why you’re not stirring the plum
pudding or going to church or something.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She climbed in to the back seat and he followed. She said,
‘You don’t seem to know much about Christmas. You make
plum puddings at least two months before and let them sort
of settle and mature. And church isn’t till eleven.’ She
glanced at him. ‘Actually I came to see how you were. I
gather you’ve been in trouble again. You certainly look
pretty ghastly. Don’t you own a comb? And you haven’t
shaved. You look like a pirate. And’—she wrinkled her nose—‘when
did you last have a bath? I wonder they let you out of
the airport. You ought to be in quarantine.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. ‘Winter sports are very strenuous—all that
snowballing and tobogganing. Matter of fact, I was at a
Christmas Eve fancy-dress party last night. Kept me up till
all hours.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘In those great clod-hopping boots? I don’t believe you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, sucks to you! It was on a skating-rink. But seriously,
Mary, tell me the score. Why this VIP treatment?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘M. You’re to check with HQ first and then go down to
lunch with him at Quarterdeck. Then, after lunch, he’s
having these men you wanted brought down for a conference.
Everything top priority. So I thought I’d better stand by too.
As you’re wrecking so many other people’s Christmases,
I thought I might as well throw mine on the slag-heap with
the others. Actually, if you want to know, I was only having
lunch with an aunt. And I loathe turkey and plum pudding.
Anyway, I just didn’t want to miss the fun and when the
duty officer got on to me about an hour ago and told me
there was a major flap, I asked him to tell the car to pick me
up on the way to the airport.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said seriously, ‘Well, you’re a damned good girl.
As a matter of fact it’s going to be the hell of a rush getting
down the bare bones of a report. And I’ve got something for
the lab to do. Will there be someone there?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course there will. You know M insists on a skeleton
staff in every Section, Christmas Day or not. But seriously,
James. Have you been in trouble? You really do look awful.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, somewhat. You’ll get the photo as I dictate.’ The
car drew up outside Bond’s flat. ‘Now be an angel and stir
up May while I clean myself up and get out of these bloody
clothes. Get her to brew me plenty of black coffee and to
pour two jiggers of our best brandy into the pot. You ask
May for what you like. She might even have some plum
pudding. Now then, it’s nine-thirty. Be a good girl and call
the Duty Officer and say OK to M’s orders and that we’ll
be along by ten-thirty. And get him to ask the lab to stand
by in half an hour.’ Bond took his passport out of his hip-pocket.
‘Then give this to the driver and ask him to get the
hell over and give it to the Duty Officer personally. Tell the
DO’—Bond turned down the corner of a page—‘to tell the
lab that the ink used is—er—home-made. All it needs is
exposure to heat. They’ll understand. Got that? Good girl.
Now come on and we’ll get May going.’ Bond went up the
steps and rang two shorts and a long on the bell.</p>

<p class="line10">*          *          *</p>

<p class="pindent">When Bond got to his desk a few minutes after ten-thirty,
feeling back to nine-tenths human, he found a folder on his
desk with the red star in the top right corner that meant
Top Secret. It contained his passport and a dozen copies of
blown-up photostats of its page 21. The list of girls’ names
was faint but legible. There was also a note marked ‘personal’.
Bond opened it. He laughed. It just said, ‘The ink
showed traces of an excess of uric acid. This is often due to a
super-abundancy of alcohol in the blood-stream. You have
been warned!’ There was no signature. So the Christmas
spirit had permeated even into the solemn crevices of one
of the most secret Sections in the building! Bond crumpled
the paper and then, thinking of Mary Goodnight’s susceptibilities,
more prudently burned it with his lighter.</p>

<p class="pindent">She came in and sat down with her shorthand book.
Bond said, ‘Now this is only a first draft, Mary, and it’s
got to be fast. So don’t mind about mistakes. M’ll understand.
We’ve got about an hour and a half if I’m to get down
to Windsor by lunch-time. Think you can manage it? All
right then, here goes. “Top Secret. Personal to M. As
instructed, on December 22nd I arrived at Zürich Central
Airport at 1330 by Swissair to make first contact in connexion
with Operation ‘Corona’ . . .” ’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned sideways to his secretary and, as he talked,
looked out across the bare trees in Regent’s Park, remembering
every minute of the last three days—the sharp, empty
smell of the air and the snow, the dark green pools of Blofeld’s
eyes, the crunch as the edge of his left hand, still bruised,
thudded down across the offered neck of the guard. And
then all the rest until Tracy, whom, without mention of
romance, he left in his report on her way to the Vier Jahreszeiten
in Munich. Then the report was finished and the
muted clack of Mary’s typewriter came from behind the
closed door. He would ring Tracy up that night when he got
back to his flat. He could already hear her laughing voice at
the other end of the wire. The nightmare in the plane was
forgotten. Now there was only the happy, secret looking-forward
to the days to come. Bond lost himself in his plans—how
to get the days off, how to get the necessary papers,
where to have the service in Scotland. Then he pulled himself
together, picked up the photostat containing the girls’
names and went up to the Communications Centre to get on
the teleprinter to Station Z.</p>

<p class="line10">*          *          *</p>

<p class="pindent">M would have preferred to live by the sea, near Plymouth
perhaps or Bristol—anywhere where he could see the stuff
whenever he wanted to and could listen to it at night. As it
was, and since he had to be within easy call of London, he
had chosen the next best thing to water, trees, and had
found a small Regency manor-house on the edge of Windsor
Forest. This was on Crown Lands, and Bond had always
suspected that an ounce of ‘Grace and Favour’ had found its
way into M’s lease. The head of the Secret Service earned
£5,000 a year, with the use of an ancient Rolls-Royce and
driver thrown in. M’s naval pay (as a Vice-Admiral on the
retired list) would add perhaps another £1,500. After taxes,
he would have about £4,000 to spend. His London life would
probably take at least half of that. Only if his rent and rates
came to no more than £500, would he be able to keep a
house in the country, and a beautiful small Regency house
at that.</p>

<p class="pindent">These thoughts ran again through Bond’s mind as he
swung the clapper of the brass ship’s-bell of some former
HMS <span class="it">Repulse</span>, the last of whose line, a battle-cruiser, had
been M’s final sea-going appointment. Hammond, M’s Chief
Petty Officer in that ship, who had followed M into retirement,
greeted Bond as an old friend, and he was shown into
M’s study.</p>

<p class="pindent">M had one of the stock bachelor’s hobbies. He painted in
water-colour. He painted only the wild orchids of England,
in the meticulous but uninspired fashion of the naturalists
of the nineteenth century. He was now at his painting-table
up against the window, his broad back hunched over his
drawing-board, with, in front of him, an extremely dim little
flower in a tooth-glass full of water. When Bond came in
and closed the door, M gave the flower one last piercingly
inquisitive glance. He got to his feet with obvious reluctance.
But he gave Bond one of his rare smiles and said, ‘Afternoon,
James.’ (He had the sailor’s meticulous observance of the
exact midday.) ‘Happy Christmas and all that. Take a chair.’
M himself went behind his desk and sat down. He was about
to come on duty. Bond automatically took his traditional
place across the desk from his Chief.</p>

<p class="pindent">M began to fill a pipe. ‘What the devil’s the name of that
fat American detective who’s always fiddling about with
orchids, those obscene hybrids from Venezuela and so forth?
Then he comes sweating out of his orchid house, eats a
gigantic meal of some foreign muck and solves the murder.
What’s he called?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nero Wolfe, sir. They’re written by a chap called Rex
Stout. I like them.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘They’re readable,’ condescended M. ‘But I was thinking
of the orchid stuff in them. How in hell can a man like those
disgusting flowers? Why, they’re damned near animals, and
their colours, all those pinks and mauves and the blotchy
yellow tongues, are positively hideous! Now that’—M waved
at the meagre little bloom in the tooth-glass—‘that’s the real
thing. That’s an Autumn Lady’s Tresses—<span class="it">spiranthes spiralis</span>,
not that I care particularly. Flowers in England as late as
October and should be under the ground by now. But I got
this forced-late specimen from a man I know—assistant to a
chap called Summerhayes who’s the orchid king at Kew.
My friend’s experimenting with cultures of a fungus which
oddly enough is a parasite on a lot of orchids, but, at the
same time, gets eaten by the orchid and acts as its staple
diet. Mycorhiza it’s called.’ M gave another of his rare
smiles. ‘But you needn’t write it down. Just wanted to take
a leaf out of this fellow Nero Wolfe’s book. However’—M
brushed the topic aside—‘can’t expect you to get excited
about these things. Now then.’ He settled back. ‘What the
devil have you been up to?’ The grey eyes regarded Bond
keenly. ‘Looks as if you haven’t been getting much sleep.
Pretty gay these winter sport places, they tell me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled. He reached into his inside pocket and took
out the pinned sheets of paper. ‘This one provided plenty of
miscellaneous entertainment, sir. Perhaps you’d like to have
a look at my report first. ’Fraid it’s only a draft. There wasn’t
much time. But I can fill in anything that isn’t clear.’</p>

<p class="pindent">M reached across for the papers, adjusted his spectacles,
and began reading.</p>

<p class="pindent">Soft rain scratched at the windows. A big log fell in the
grate. The silence was soft and comfortable. Bond looked
round the walls at M’s treasured collection of naval prints.
Everywhere there were mountainous seas, crashing cannon,
bellying sails, tattered battle pennants—the fury of ancient
engagements, the memories of ancient enemies, the French,
the Dutch, the Spaniards, even the Americans. All gone, all
friends now with one another. Not a sign of the enemies of
today. Who was backing Blofeld, for instance, in the inscrutable
conspiracy in which he was now certainly engaged?
The Russians? The Chinese? Or was it an independent job,
as Thunderball had been? And what was the conspiracy?
What was the job for the protection of which six or seven of
Blofeld’s men had died within less than a week? Would M
read anything into the evidence? Would the experts who
were coming that afternoon? Bond lifted his left wrist.
Remembered that he no longer had a watch. <span class="it">That</span> he would
certainly be allowed on expenses. He would get another one
as soon as the shops opened after Boxing Day. Another
Rolex? Probably. They were on the heavy side, but they
worked. And at least you could see the time in the dark with
those big phosphorus numerals. Somewhere in the hall, a
clock struck the half-hour. 1.30. Twelve hours before, he
must have just set up the trap that killed the three men in the
Mercedes. Self-defence, but the hell of a way to celebrate
Christmas!</p>

<p class="pindent">M threw the papers down on his desk. His pipe had gone
out and he now slowly lit it again. He tossed the spent match
accurately over his shoulder into the fire. He put his hands
flat on the desk and said—and there was an unusual kindness
in his voice—‘Well, you were pretty lucky to get out of that
one, James. Didn’t know you could ski.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I only just managed to stay upright, sir. Wouldn’t like to
try it again.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No. And I see you say you can’t come to any conclusions
about what Blofeld is up to?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s right, sir. Haven’t got a clue.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, nor have I. I just don’t understand any part of it.
Perhaps the professors’ll help us out this afternoon. But
you’re obviously right that it’s <span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">SPECTRE</span></span> all over again. By
the way, your tip about Pontresina was a good one. He was a
Bulgar. Can’t remember his name, but Interpol turned him
up for us. Plastic explosives expert. Worked for KBG in
Turkey. If it’s true that the U2 that fellow Powers was
piloting was brought down by delayed charges and not by
rockets, it may be this man was implicated. He was on the
list of suspects. Then he turned free-lance. Went into
business on his own. That’s probably when <span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">SPECTRE</span></span> picked
him up. We were doubtful about your identification of
Blofeld. The Pontresina lead helped a lot. You’re absolutely
sure of him, are you? He certainly seems to have done a good
job on his face and stomach. Better set him up on the
Identicast when you get back this evening. We’ll have a look
at him and get the views of the medical gentry.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I think it must be him, sir. I was really getting the
authentic smell of him on the last day—yesterday, that is.
It seems a long time ago already.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You were lucky to run into this girl. Who is she? Some
old flame of yours?’ M’s mouth turned down at the corners.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘More or less, sir. She came into my report on the first
news we got that Blofeld was in Switzerland. Daughter of
this man Draco, head of the Union Corse. Her mother was an
English governess.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hm. Interesting breeding. Now then. Time for lunch.
I told Hammond we weren’t to be disturbed.’ M got up and
pressed the bell by the fire-place. ‘ ’Fraid we’ve got to go
through the turkey and plum pudding routine. Mrs Hammond’s
been brooding over her pots and pans for weeks.
Damned sentimental rubbish.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Hammond appeared at the door, and Bond followed M
through and into the small dining-room beyond the hall
whose walls glittered with M’s other hobby, the evolution
of the naval cutlass. They sat down. M said, with mock
ferocity, to Hammond, ‘All right, Chief Petty Officer Hammond.
Do your worst.’ And then, with real vehemence,
‘What in hell are those things doing here?’ He pointed at the
centre of the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Crackers, sir,’ said Hammond stolidly. ‘Mrs Hammond
thought that seeing as you have company . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Throw them out. Give ’em to the schoolchildren. I’ll
go so far with Mrs Hammond, but I’m damned if I’m going
to have my dining-room turned into a nursery.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Hammond smiled. He said, ‘Aye, aye, sir,’ gathered up the
shimmering crackers and departed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was aching for a drink. He got a small glass of very
old Marsala and most of a bottle of very bad Algerian wine.</p>

<p class="pindent">M treated his two glasses as if they had been Château
Lafitte. ‘Good old “Infuriator”. Staple drink for the fleet
in the Mediterranean. Got real guts to it. I remember an old
shipmate of mine, McLachlan, my Chief Gunnery Officer at
the time, betting he could get down six bottles of the stuff.
Damn fool. Measured his length on the wardroom floor after
only three. Drink up, James! Drink up!’</p>

<p class="pindent">At last the plum pudding arrived, flaming traditionally.
Mrs Hammond had implanted several cheap silver gewgaws
in it and M nearly broke a tooth on the miniature horseshoe.
Bond got the bachelor’s button. He thought of Tracy. It
should have been the ring!</p>
