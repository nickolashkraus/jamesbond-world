<p class="line7"><span class="sc"><span class="gesp">It was</span></span> one of those Septembers when it seemed that the
summer would never end.</p>

<p class="pindent">The five-mile promenade of Royale-les-Eaux, backed by
trim lawns emblazoned at intervals with tricolour beds of
salvia, alyssum and lobelia, was bright with flags and, on the
longest beach in the north of France, the gay bathing tents
still marched prettily down to the tide-line in big, money-making
battalions. Music, one of those lilting accordion
waltzes, blared from the loudspeakers around the Olympic-size
piscine and, from time to time, echoing above the music,
a man’s voice announced over the public address system that
Philippe Bertrand, aged seven, was looking for his mother,
that Yolande Lefèvre was waiting for her friends below the
clock at the entrance, or that a Madame Dufours was demanded
on the telephone. From the beach, particularly from
the neighbourhood of the three playground enclosures—‘Joie
de Vivre’, ‘Helio’ and ‘Azur’—came a twitter of
children’s cries that waxed and waned with the thrill of their
games and, farther out, on the firm sand left by the now
distant sea, the shrill whistle of the physical-fitness instructor
marshalled his teenagers through the last course of the
day.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was one of those beautiful, naive seaside panoramas for
which the Brittany and Picardy beaches have provided the
setting—and inspired their recorders, Boudin, Tissot, Monet—ever
since the birth of plages and bains de mer more than a
hundred years ago.</p>

<p class="pindent">To James Bond, sitting in one of the concrete shelters
with his face to the setting sun, there was something poignant,
ephemeral about it all. It reminded him almost too vividly of
childhood—of the velvet feel of the hot powder sand, and the
painful grit of wet sand between young toes when the time
came for him to put his shoes and socks on, of the precious
little pile of sea-shells and interesting wrack on the sill of his
bedroom window (‘No, we’ll have to leave that behind,
darling. It’ll dirty up your trunk!’), of the small crabs scuttling
away from the nervous fingers groping beneath the seaweed
in the rock-pools, of the swimming and swimming and
swimming through the dancing waves—always in those days,
it seemed, lit with sunshine—and then the infuriating, inevitable
‘time to come out’. It was all there, his own childhood,
spread out before him to have another look at. What a
long time ago they were, those spade-and-bucket days! How
far he had come since the freckles and the Cadbury milk-chocolate
Flakes and the fizzy lemonade! Impatiently Bond
lit a cigarette, pulled his shoulders out of their slouch and
slammed the mawkish memories back into their long-closed
file. Today he was a grown-up, a man with years of dirty,
dangerous memories—a spy. He was not sitting in this
concrete hideout to sentimentalize about a pack of scrubby,
smelly children on a beach scattered with bottle-tops and
lolly-sticks and fringed by a sea thick with sun-oil and putrid
with the main drains of Royale. He was here, he had chosen
to be here, to spy. To spy on a woman.</p>

<p class="pindent">The sun was getting lower. Already one could smell the
September chill that all day had lain hidden beneath the
heat. The cohorts of bathers were in quick retreat, striking
their little camps and filtering up the steps and across the
promenade into the shelter of the town where the lights were
going up in the cafés. The announcer at the swimming-pool
harried his customers: ‘Allo! Allo! Fermeture en dix
minutes! A dix-huit heures, fermeture de la piscine!’ Silhouetted
in the path of the setting sun, the two Bombard
rescue-boats with flags bearing a blue cross on a yellow background
were speeding northwards for their distant shelter
up-river in the Vieux Port. The last of the gay, giraffe-like
sand-yachts fled down the distant water-line towards its
corral among the sand dunes, and the three agents cyclistes
in charge of the car-parks pedalled away through the melting
ranks of cars towards the police station in the centre of the
town. In a matter of minutes the vast expanse of sand—the
tide, still receding, was already a mile out—would be left to
the seagulls that would soon be flocking in their hordes to
forage for the scraps of food left by the picnickers. Then the
orange ball of the sun would hiss down into the sea and the
beach would, for a while, be entirely deserted, until, under
cover of darkness, the prowling lovers would come to writhe
briefly, grittily in the dark corners between the bathing-huts
and the sea-wall.</p>

<p class="pindent">On the beaten stretch of sand below where James Bond
was sitting, two golden girls in exciting bikinis packed up the
game of Jokari which they had been so provocatively playing,
and raced each other up the steps towards Bond’s shelter.
They flaunted their bodies at him, paused and chattered to
see if he would respond, and, when he didn’t, linked arms
and sauntered on towards the town, leaving Bond wondering
why it was that French girls had more prominent navels
than any others. Was it that French surgeons sought to add,
even in this minute respect, to the future sex-appeal of girl
babies?</p>

<p class="pindent">And now, up and down the beach, the lifeguards gave a
final blast on their horns to announce that they were going
off duty, the music from the piscine stopped in mid-tune
and the great expanse of sand was suddenly deserted.</p>

<p class="pindent">But not quite! A hundred yards out, lying face downwards
on a black and white striped bathing-wrap, on the
private patch of firm sand where she had installed herself an
hour before, the girl was still there, motionless, spread-eagled
in direct line between James Bond and the setting sun
that was now turning the left-behind pools and shallow
rivulets into blood-red, meandering scrawls across the middle
distance. Bond went on watching her—now, in the silence
and emptiness, with an ounce more tension. He was waiting
for her to do something—for something, he didn’t know
what, to happen. It would be more true to say that he was
watching <span class="it">over</span> her. He had an instinct that she was in some
sort of danger. Or was it just that there was the smell of
danger in the air? He didn’t know. He only knew that he
mustn’t leave her alone, particularly now that everyone else
had gone.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond was mistaken. Not everyone else had gone.
Behind him, at the Café de la Plage on the other side of the
promenade, two men in raincoats and dark caps sat at a
secluded table bordering the sidewalk. They had half-empty
cups of coffee in front of them and they didn’t talk. They sat
and watched the blur on the frosted-glass partition of the
shelter that was James Bond’s head and shoulders. They also
watched, but less intently, the distant white blur on the sand
that was the girl. Their stillness, and their unseasonable
clothes, would have made a disquieting impression on anyone
who, in his turn, might have been watching them. But there
was no such person, except their waiter who had simply put
them in the category of ‘bad news’ and hoped they would
soon be on their way.</p>

<p class="pindent">When the lower rim of the orange sun touched the sea, it
was almost as if a signal had sounded for the girl. She slowly
got to her feet, ran both hands backwards through her hair and
began to walk evenly, purposefully towards the sun and the
far-away froth of the water-line over a mile away. It would be
violet dusk by the time she reached the sea and one might
have guessed that this was probably the last day of her holiday,
her last bathe.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond thought otherwise. He left his shelter, ran
down the steps to the sand and began walking out after her
at a fast pace. Behind him, across the promenade, the two
men in raincoats also seemed to think otherwise. One of them
briskly threw down some coins and they both got up and,
walking strictly in step, crossed the promenade to the sand
and, with a kind of urgent military precision, marched
rapidly side by side in Bond’s tracks.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now the strange pattern of figures on the vast expanse of
empty, blood-streaked sand was eerily conspicuous. Yet it
was surely not one to be interfered with! The pattern had
a nasty, a secret smell. The white girl, the bare-headed young
man, the two squat, marching pursuers—it had something
of a kind of deadly Grandmother’s Steps about it. In the
café, the waiter collected the coins and looked after the distant
figures, still outlined by the last quarter of the orange
sun. It smelt like police business—or the other thing. He
would keep it to himself but remember it. He might get his
name in the papers.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond was rapidly catching up with the girl. Now he
knew that he would get to her just as she reached the water-line.
He began to wonder what he would say to her, how he
would put it. He couldn’t say, ‘I had a hunch you were
going to commit suicide so I came after you to stop you.’ ‘I
was going for a walk on the beach and I thought I recognized
you. Will you have a drink after your swim?’ would be
childish. He finally decided to say, ‘Oh, Tracy!’ and then,
when she turned round, ‘I was worried about you.’ Which
would at least be inoffensive and, for the matter of that,
true.</p>

<p class="pindent">The sea was now gunmetal below a primrose horizon. A
small, westerly offshore breeze, drawing the hot land-air out
to sea, had risen and was piling up wavelets that scrolled in
whitely as far as the eye could see. Flocks of herring gulls
lazily rose and settled again at the girl’s approach, and the air
was full of their mewing and of the endless lap-lap of the
small waves. The soft indigo dusk added a touch of melancholy
to the empty solitude of sand and sea, now so far away
from the comforting bright lights and holiday bustle of ‘La
Reine de la Côte Opale’, as Royale-les-Eaux had splendidly
christened herself. Bond looked forward to getting the girl
back to those bright lights. He watched the lithe golden
figure in the white one-piece bathing-suit and wondered how
soon she would be able to hear his voice above the noise of
the gulls and the sea. Her pace had slowed a fraction as she
approached the water-line and her head, with its bell of
heavy fair hair to the shoulders, was slightly bowed, in
thought perhaps, or tiredness.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond quickened his step until he was only ten paces behind
her. ‘Hey! Tracy!’</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl didn’t start or turn quickly round. Her steps
faltered and stopped, and then, as a small wave creamed in
and died at her feet, she turned slowly and stood squarely
facing him. Her eyes, puffed and wet with tears, looked past
him. Then they met his. She said dully, ‘What is it? What do
you want?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I was worried about you. What are you doing out here?
What’s the matter?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl looked past him again. Her clenched right hand
went up to her mouth. She said something, something Bond
couldn’t understand, from behind it. Then a voice from very
close behind Bond, said softly, silkily, ‘Don’t, move or you
get it back of the knee.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond swirled round into a crouch, his gun hand inside his
coat. The steady silver eyes of the two automatics sneered at
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond slowly straightened himself. He dropped his hand to
his side and the held breath came out between his teeth in a
quiet hiss. The two dead-pan, professional faces told him
even more than the two silver eyes of the guns. They held
no tension, no excitement. The thin half-smiles were relaxed,
contented. The eyes were not even wary. They were almost
bored. Bond had looked into such faces many times before.
This was routine. These men were killers—pro-killers.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had no idea who these men were, who they worked
for, what this was all about. On the theory that worry is a
dividend paid to disaster before it is due, he consciously
relaxed his muscles and emptied his mind of questions. He
stood and waited.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Position your hands behind your neck.’ The silky, patient
voice was from the south, from the Mediterranean. It fitted
with the men’s faces—tough-skinned, widely pored, yellow-brown.
Marseillais perhaps, or Italian. The Mafia? The faces
belonged to good secret police or tough crooks. Bond’s mind
ticked and whirred, selecting cards like an IBM machine.
What enemies had he got in those areas? Might it be Blofeld?
Had the hare turned upon the hound?</p>

<p class="pindent">When the odds are hopeless, when all seems to be lost,
then is the time to be calm, to make a show of authority—at
least of indifference. Bond smiled into the eyes of the man
who had spoken. ‘I don’t think your mother would like to
know what you are doing this evening. You are a Catholic?
So I will do as you ask.’ The man’s eyes glittered. Touché!
Bond clasped his hands behind his head.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man stood aside so as to have a clear field of fire while
his Number Two removed Bond’s Walther PPK from the
soft leather holster inside his trouser belt and ran expert
hands down his sides, down his arms to the wrists and down
the inside of his thighs. Then Number Two stood back,
pocketed the Walther and again took out his own gun.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond glanced over his shoulder. The girl had said nothing,
expressed neither surprise nor alarm. Now she was standing
with her back to the group, looking out to sea, apparently
relaxed, unconcerned. What in God’s name was it all about?
Had she been used as a bait? But for whom? And now what?
Was he to be executed, his body left lying to be rolled back
inshore by the tide? It seemed the only solution. If it was a
question of some kind of a deal, the four of them could not
just walk back across the mile of sand to the town and say
polite goodbyes on the promenade steps. No. This was the
terminal point. Or was it? From the north, through the deep
indigo dusk, came the fast, rattling hum of an outboard and,
as Bond watched, the cream of a thick bow-wave showed and
then the blunt outline of one of the Bombard rescue-craft, the
flat-bottomed inflatable rubber boats with a single Johnson
engine in the flattened stern. So they had been spotted! By
the coastguards perhaps? And here was rescue! By God,
he’d roast these two thugs when they got to the harbour
police at the Vieux Port! But what story would he tell about
the girl?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned back to face the men. At once he knew the
worst. They had rolled their trousers up to the knees and were
waiting, composedly, their shoes in one hand and their guns
in the other. This was no rescue. It was just part of the ride.
Oh well! Paying no attention to the men, Bond bent down,
rolled up his trousers as they had done and, in the process of
fumbling with his socks and shoes, palmed one of his heel
knives and, half turning towards the boat that had now
grounded in the shallows, transferred it to his right-hand
trouser pocket.</p>

<p class="pindent">No words were exchanged. The girl climbed aboard first,
then Bond, and lastly the two men who helped the engine
with a final shove on the stern. The boatman, who looked
like any other French deep-sea fisherman, whirled the blunt
nose of the Bombard round, changed gears to forward, and
they were off northwards through the buffeting waves while
the golden hair of the girl streamed back and softly whipped
James Bond’s cheek.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Tracy. You’re going to catch cold. Here. Take my coat.’
Bond slipped his coat off. She held out a hand to help him
put it on her. In the process her hand found his and pressed
it. Now what the hell? Bond edged closer to her. He felt her
body respond. Bond glanced at the two men. They sat hunched
against the wind, their hands in their pockets, watchful,
but somehow uninterested. Behind them the necklace of
lights that was Royale receded swiftly until it was only a
golden glow on the horizon. James Bond’s right hand felt for
the comforting knife in his pocket and ran his thumb across
the razor-sharp blade.</p>

<p class="pindent">While he wondered how and when he might have a chance
to use it, the rest of his mind ran back over the previous
twenty-four hours and panned them for the gold-dust of
truth.</p>
