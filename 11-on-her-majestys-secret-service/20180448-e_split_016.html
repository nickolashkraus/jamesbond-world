<p class="line7"><span class="sc"><span class="gesp">Bond was</span></span> shown out of the building by a man in a white
coat with the conventional white gauze of the laboratory
worker over the lower half of his face. Bond attempted no
conversation. He was now well inside the fortress, but he
would have to continue to walk on tiptoe and be damned
careful where he put his feet!</p>

<p class="pindent">He returned to his room and got out one of the giant
sheets of squared paper with which he had been furnished.
He sat down at his table and wrote firmly at the top centre
of the paper ‘Guillaume de Bleuville, 1207-1243’. Now there
were five hundred years of de Bleuvilles, with their wives
and children, to be copied down from his books and notes.
That would fill up an impressive number of pages with
impeccable fact. He could certainly spread that chore over
three days, interspersed with more tricky work—gassing with
Blofeld about the Blofeld end of the story. Fortunately there
were some English Blofields he could throw in as make-weight.
And some Bluefields and Blumfields. He could start
some pretty hares running in those directions! And, in
between these idiotic activities, he would ferret and ferret
away at the mystery of what in hell the new Blofeld, the new
<span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">SPECTRE</span></span>, were up to!</p>

<p class="pindent">One thing was certain, they had already been through
his belongings. Before going for his interview, Bond had
gone into the bathroom, away from that seemingly watchful
hole in the ceiling, and had painfully pulled out half a dozen
of his hairs. These, while he had selected the books he
needed to take with him, he had dispersed inconspicuously
among his other papers and in his passport. The hairs were
all gone. Someone had been through all his books. He got
up and went to the chest of drawers, ostensibly for a handkerchief.
Yes, the careful patterns in which he had laid out
his things had all been minutely disturbed. Unemotionally
he went back to his work, thanking heaven he had travelled
as ‘clean’ as a whistle! But by God he’d have to keep his
cover solid! He didn’t at all like the thought of that one-way
trip down the bob-run!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got as far as 1350 and then the noise from the
veranda became too distracting. Anyway, he had done a
respectable stint, almost to the bottom of the giant page. He
would go out and do a little very discreet exploring. He
wanted to get his bearings, or rather confirm them, and this
would be a perfectly reasonable activity for a newcomer.
He had left his door into the passage ajar. He went out and
along to the reception lounge, where the man in the plum
coat was busy entering the names of the morning’s visitors
in a book. Bond’s greeting was politely answered. There was
a ski-room and workshop to the left of the exit. Bond
wandered in. One of the Balkan types was at the work-bench,
screwing a new binding on to a ski. He looked up and
went on with his work while Bond gazed with seeming
curiosity at the ranks of skis standing along the wall. Things
had changed since his day. The bindings were quite different
and designed, it seemed, to keep the heel dead flat on the ski.
And there were new safety releases. Many of the skis were of
metal and the ski-sticks were fibre-glass lances that looked
to Bond extremely dangerous in the event of a bad fall.
Bond wandered over to the work-bench and feigned interest
in what the man was doing. In fact he had seen something
that excited him very much—an untidy pile of lengths of
thin plastic strip for the boot to rest on in the binding, so
that, on the shiny surface, snow would not ball under the
sole. Bond leaned over the work-bench, resting on his right
elbow, and commented on the precision of the man’s work.
The man grunted and concentrated all the more closely to
avoid further conversation. Bond’s left hand slid under his
leaning arm, secured one of the strips and slid it up his
sleeve. He made a further inane comment, which was not
answered, and strolled out of the ski-room.</p>

<p class="pindent">(When the man in the workshop heard the front door hiss
shut, he turned to the pile of plastic strips and counted them
carefully twice. Then he went out to the man in the plum-coloured
coat and spoke to him in German. The man nodded
and picked up the telephone receiver and dialled O. The
workman went stolidly back to his ski-room.)</p>

<p class="pindent">As Bond strolled along the path that led to the cable
station, he transferred the plastic strip from his sleeve to his
trouser pocket, feeling pleased with himself. He had at least
provided himself with one tool—the traditional burglar’s
tool for opening the Yale-type locks that secured the doors.</p>

<p class="pindent">Away from the club-house, to which only a thin trickle of
smart-looking people were making their way, he got into the
usual mountain-top crowd—people swarming out of the
cable-head, skiers wobbling or schussing down the easy
nursery slopes on the plateau, little groups marshalled under
individual teachers and guides from the valley. The terrace
of the public restaurant was already crowded with the underprivileged
who hadn’t got the money or the connexions to
join the club. He walked below it on the well-trampled snow
and stood among the skiers at the top of the first plunging
schuss of the Gloria run. A large notice-board, crowned with
the G and the coronet, announced <span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">GLORIA ABFAHRT!</span></span> Then
below, <span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">ROT—FREIE FAHRT. GELB—FREIE FAHRT.</span></span>
<span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">SCHWARZ—GESPERRT</span></span>, meaning that the red and yellow
runs were open but the black closed, presumably because
of avalanche danger. Below this again was a painted metal
map of the three runs. Bond had a good look at it, reflecting
that it might be wise to commit to memory the red, which was
presumably the easiest and most popular. There were red,
yellow, and black marker flags on the map, and Bond could
see the actual flags fluttering way down the mountain until
the runs, studded with tiny moving figures, disappeared to
the left, round the shoulder of the mountain and under the
cable railway. The red seemed to continue to zigzag under
the cable and between the few high pylons until it met the
tree line. Then there was a short stretch of wood-running
until the final easy schuss across the undulating lower
meadows to the bottom cable-head, beyond which lay the
main railway line and then the Pontresina-Samaden road.
Bond tried to get it all fixed in his mind. Then he watched
some of the starts. These varied between the arrow-like
dive of the Kannonen, the stars, who took the terrific schuss
dead straight in a low crouch with their sticks jauntily
tucked under their arm-pits, the average amateur who braked
perhaps three or four times on his way down, and the terrified
novice who, with stuck-out behind, stemmed his way down,
his skis angled and edged like a snow-plough, with occasional
straight runs diagonally across the polished slope—dashing
little sprints that usually ended in a mild crash as he ran off
the flattened surface into the thick powder snow that edged
the wide, beaten piste.</p>

<p class="pindent">The scene was the same as a thousand others Bond had
witnessed when, as a teenager, he learned his skiing in the
old Hannes Schneider School at St Anton in the Arlberg.
He had got pretty good and had won his golden K, but the
style in those days was rudimentary compared with what
he was now witnessing from the occasional expert who
zoomed down and away from beside him. Today the metal
skis seemed to run faster and truer than the old steel-edged
hickory. There was less shoulder-work and the art of
Wedeln, a gentle waggling of the hips, was a revelation.
Would it be as effective in deep new snow as it was on the
well-beaten piste? Bond was doubtful, but he was envious
of it. It was so much more graceful than the old Arlberg
crouch. Bond wondered how he would fare on this terrific
run. He would certainly not dare to take the first schuss
straight. He would brake at least twice, perhaps there and
there. And his legs would be trembling before he had been
going for five minutes. His knees and ankles and wrists
would be giving out. He <span class="it">must</span> get on with his exercises!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond, excited, left the scene and followed arrows that
pointed to the <span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">GLORIA EXPRESS BOB-RUN</span></span>. It lay on the
other side of the cable station. There was a small wooden
hut, the starter’s hut, with telephone-wires connected to the
station, and, beneath the cable station, a little ‘garage’ that
housed the bob-sleighs and one-man skeleton-bobs. A chain,
with a notice on it saying <span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">ABFAHRTEN TÄGLICH</span></span> 0900-1100,
was stretched across the wide mouth of the gulch of
blue ice that curved away to the left and then disappeared
over the shoulder. Here again was a metal map showing the
zigzag course of the run down into the valley. In deference
to the English traditions at the sport, outstanding curves and
hazards were marked with names such as ‘Dead Man’s
Leap’, ‘Whizz-Bang Straight’, ‘Battling S’, ‘Hell’s Delight’,
‘The Boneshaker’, and the finishing straight down ‘Paradise
Alley’. Bond visualized the scene that morning, heard again
that heart-rending scream. Yes, that death certainly had the
old Blofeld touch!</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sair Hilary! Sair Hilary!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Startled out of his thoughts, Bond turned. Fräulein Irma
Bunt, her short arms akimbo, was standing on the path to
the club.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Lunch time! Lunch!’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Coming,’ Bond called back, and strolled up the slope
towards her. He noted that, even in that hundred yards,
his breathing was shallow and his limbs were heavy. This
blasted height! He really must get into training!</p>

<p class="pindent">He came up with her. She looked surly. He said that he was
sorry, he had not noticed the time. She said nothing. The
yellow eyes surveyed him with active dislike before she
turned her back and led the way along the path.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked back over the morning. What had he done?
Had he made a mistake? Well, he just might have. Better
re-insure! As they came through the entrance into the reception
lounge, Bond said casually, ‘Oh, by the way, Fräulein
Bunt, I was in the ski-room just now.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She halted. Bond noticed that the head of the receptionist
bent a fraction lower over his visitors’ book.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took the length of plastic out of his pocket. ‘I found
just what I wanted.’ He stitched a smile of innocent pleasure
on his face. ‘Like an idiot I forgot to bring a ruler with me.
And there were these things on the work-bench. Just right.
So I borrowed one. I hope that was all right. Of course I’ll
leave it behind when I go. But for these family trees, you
know’—Bond sketched a series of descending straight lines
in the air—‘one has to get them on the right levels. I hope
you don’t mind.’ He smiled charmingly. ‘I was going to
confess the next time I saw you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Irma Bunt veiled her eyes. ‘It is of no consequence. In
future, anything you need you will perhaps ring for, isn’t it?
The Count wishes you to have every facility. Now’—she
gestured—‘if you will perhaps go out on the terrace. You
will be shown to our table. I will be with you in a moment.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond went through the restaurant door. Several of the
interior tables were occupied by those who had had enough
sun. He went across the room and out through the now open
French windows. The man Fritz, who appeared to be the
maître d’hôtel, came towards him through the crowded
tables. His eyes too were cold with hostility. He held up a
menu. ‘Please to follow me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond followed him to the table up against the railing.
Ruby and Violet were already there. Bond felt almost light-hearted
with relief at having clean hands again. By God, he
must pay attention, take care! This time he had got away
with it. And he still had the strip of plastic! Had he sounded
innocent enough, stupid enough? He sat down and ordered a
double medium-dry vodka Martini, on the rocks, with lemon
peel, and edged his feet up against Ruby’s.</p>

<p class="pindent">She didn’t withdraw hers. She smiled. Violet smiled. They
all started talking at once. It was suddenly a beautiful day.</p>

<p class="pindent">Fräulein Bunt appeared and took her place. She was
gracious again. ‘I am so pleased to hear that you will be
staying with us for a whole week, Sair Hilary. You enjoyed
your interview with the Count? Is he not an interesting
man?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Very interesting. Unfortunately our talk was too short
and we discussed only my own subject. I was longing to ask
him about his research work. I hope he didn’t think me very
rude.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Irma Bunt’s face closed perceptibly. ‘I am sure not. The
Count does not often like to discuss his work. In these
specialized scientific fields, you understand, there is much
jealousy and, I am sorry to say, much intellectual thieving.’
The box-like smile. ‘I do not of course refer to yourself, my
dear Sair Hilary, but to scientists less scrupulous than the
Count, to spies from the chemical companies. That is why
we keep ourselves very much to ourselves in our little Eagle’s
Nest up here. We have total privacy. Even the police in the
valley are most co-operative in safeguarding us from intruders.
They appreciate what the Count is doing.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The study of allergies?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Just so.’ The maître d’hôtel was standing by her side. His
feet came together with a perceptible click. Menus were
handed round and Bond’s drink came. He took a long pull
at it and ordered Œufs Gloria and a green salad. Chicken
again for Ruby, cold cuts ‘with stacks of potatoes’ for
Violet. Irma Bunt ordered her usual cottage cheese and salad.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t you girls eat anything but chicken and potatoes?
Is this something to do with your allergies?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Ruby began, ‘Well, yes, in a way. Somehow I’ve come
to simply love . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">Irma Bunt broke in sharply. ‘Now then. Ruby. No discussion
of treatments, you remember? Not even with our
good friend Sair Hilary.’ She waved a hand towards the
crowded tables around them. ‘A most interesting crowd, do
you not find, Sair Hilary? Everybody who is anybody. We
have quite taken the international set away from Gstaad and
St Moritz. That is your Duke of Marlborough over there
with such a gay party of young things. And near by that is
Mr Whitney and Lady Daphne Straight. Is she not chic?
They are both wonderful skiers. And that beautiful girl
with the long fair hair at the big table, that is Ursula Andress,
the film star. What a wonderful tan she has! And Sir George
Dunbar, he always has the most enchanting companions.’
The box-like smile. ‘Why, we only need the Aga Khan and
perhaps your Duke of Kent and we would have everybody,
but everybody. Is it not sensational for the first season?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said it was. The lunch came. Bond’s eggs were
delicious—chopped hard-boiled eggs, with a cream and
cheese sauce laced with English mustard (English mustard
seemed to be the clue to the Gloria specialities), gratinés in
a copper dish. Bond commented on the excellence of the
cooking.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thank you,’ said Irma Bunt. ‘We have three expert
Frenchmen in the kitchen. Men are very good at cooking,
is it not?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond felt rather than saw a man approaching their table.
He came up to Bond. He was a military-looking man, of
about Bond’s age, and he had a puzzled expression on his
face. He bowed slightly to the ladies and said to Bond,
‘Excuse me, but I saw your name in the visitors’ book. It is
Hilary Bray, isn’t it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s heart sank. This situation had always been a
possibility and he had prepared a fumbling counter to it.
But this was the worst possible moment with that damned
woman watching and listening!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, ‘Yes, it is,’ with heartiness.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Sir</span> Hilary Bray?’ The pleasant face was even more
puzzled.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got to his feet and stood with his back to his table,
to Irma Bunt. ‘That’s right.’ He took out his handkerchief
and blew his nose to obscure the next question, which might
be fatal.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘In the Lovat Scouts during the war?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ah,’ said Bond. He looked worried, lowered his voice
appropriately. ‘You’re thinking of my first cousin. From Ben
Trilleachan. Died six months ago, poor chap. I inherited the
title.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, lord!’ The man’s puzzlement cleared. Grief took its
place. ‘Sorry to hear that. Great pal of mine in the war.
Funny! I didn’t see anything about it in <span class="it">The Times</span>. Always
read the “Births, Marriages, and Deaths”. What was it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond felt the sweat running down under his arms. ‘Fell
off one of those bloody mountains of his. Broke his neck.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My God! Poor chap! But he was always fooling around
the tops by himself. I must write to Jenny at once.’ He held
out his hand. ‘Well, sorry to have butted in. Thought this
was a funny place to find old Hilary. Well, so long, and sorry
again.’ He moved off between the tables. Out of the corner
of his eye, Bond saw him rejoin a very English-looking table
of men and, obviously, wives, to whom he began talking
animatedly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat down, reached for his drink and drained it and
went back to his eggs. The woman’s eyes were on him. He
felt the sweat running down his face. He took out his handkerchief
and mopped at it. ‘Gosh, it’s hot out here in the sun!
That was some pal of my first cousin’s. My cousin had the
same name. Collateral branch. Died not long ago, poor chap.’
He frowned sadly. ‘Didn’t know this man from Adam. Nice-looking
fellow.’ Bond looked bravely across the table. ‘Do
you know any of his party, Fräulein Bunt?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Without looking at the party, Fräulein Bunt said shortly,
‘No, I do not know everyone who comes here.’ The yellow
eyes were still inquisitive, holding his. ‘But it was a curious
coincidence. Were you very alike, you and your cousin?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, absolutely,’ said Bond, gushing. ‘Spit image. Often
used to get taken for each other.’ He looked across at the
English group. Thank God they were picking up their things
and going. They didn’t look particularly smart or prosperous.
Probably staying at Pontresina or under the ex-officers’
scheme at St Moritz. Typical English skiing party. With
any luck they were just doing the big runs in the neighbourhood
one by one. Bond reviewed the way the conversation
had gone while coffee came and he made cheerful small talk
with Ruby, whose foot was again clamped against his, about
her skiing progress that morning.</p>

<p class="pindent">Well, he decided, the woman couldn’t have heard much
of it with all the clatter and chatter from the surrounding
tables. But it had been a narrow squeak, a damned narrow
squeak. The second of the day!</p>

<p class="pindent">So much for walking on tiptoe inside the enemy lines!</p>

<p class="pindent">Not good enough! Definitely not good enough!</p>
