<p class="line7"><span class="sc"><span class="gesp">Now it</span></span> was just a question of sitting out the hours. When
would they have finished with Campbell? Quick, rough
torture is rarely effective against a professional, apart from
the likelihood of the man rapidly losing consciousness,
becoming so punch-drunk that he is incoherent. The pro,
if he is a tough man spiritually, can keep the ‘game’ alive for
hours by minor admissions, by telling long, rambling tales
and sticking to them. Such tales need verification. Blofeld
would undoubtedly have his man in Zürich, would be able
to contact him on his radio, get him to check this or that date
or address, but that also would require time. Then, if it was
proved that Campbell had told lies, they would have to begin
again. So far as Bond and his identity were concerned, it all
depended on Campbell’s reading of why Bond was up at
the Gloria Club. He must guess, because of Bond’s curt
disavowal of him, that it was something clandestine, something
important. Would he have the wits to cover up Bond,
the guts, against the electrical and mechanical devices they
would surely use against him? He could say that, when he
came to and saw Bond, in his semi-conscious state he had
for a moment thought Bond was his brother, James Campbell.
Some story like that. If he had the wits! If he had the guts!
Had Campbell got a death pill, perhaps one of the buttons
on his ski-jacket or trousers? Bond sharply put the thought
away. He had been on the edge of wishing that Campbell
had!</p>

<p class="pindent">Well, he would be wise to assume that it was only a matter
of hours and then they would come for him. They wouldn’t
do it until after lights-out. To do it before would cause
too much talk among the girls. No, they would fetch him at
night and the next day it would be put about that he had left
by the first cable car down to the valley. Meanwhile he would
be buried deep in a snow overcoat, or more likely deposited
in a high crevasse in the near-by Piz Languard glacier, to
come out at the bottom, fifty years later, out of his deep
freeze, with multiple contusions but no identification marks—a
nameless victim of ‘les neiges éternelles’!</p>

<p class="pindent">Yes, he must plan for that. Bond got up from the desk
where he had been automatically scribbling down lists of
fifteenth-century de Bleuvilles and opened the window. The
snow had stopped and there was broken blue in the sky. It
would be perfect powder snow, perhaps a foot of it, on the
Gloria Run. Now to make everything ready!</p>

<p class="pindent">There are hundreds of secret inks, but there was only one
available to Bond, the oldest one in the world, his own urine.
He went into the bathroom (what must the televising eye
think of his digestive tracts?) with his pen, a clean nib, and
his passport. Then he sat down and proceeded to transcribe,
from the flimsy pieces of paper in his pocket on to a blank
page of his passport, the names and approximate locations by
county of the girls. The page showed nothing. Held in front
of a flame, the writing would come up brown. He slipped the
passport into his hip-pocket. Next he took the gloves from
under his sweater, tried them on, and found them an adequate
but tight fit, took the top off the lavatory cistern and laid the
gloves along the arm of the stop-cock.</p>

<p class="pindent">What else? It was going to be fiendishly cold at the start,
but his body would soon be drenched in sweat. He would
just have to make do with the ski-clothes he possessed, the
gloves, the goggles that had been placed on his table, and the
flat glass flask of schnapps that he would carry in one of his
side pockets and not, in case of a fall, in his hip-pocket.
Extra covering for his face? Bond thought of using one of his
warm vests and cutting eye-holes in it. But it would surely
slip and perhaps blind him. He had some dark-red silk
bandana handkerchiefs. He would tie one tight over his face
below the goggles and discard it if it interfered with his
breathing. So! That was the lot! There was nothing else he
could do or insure against. The rest was up to the Fates.
Bond relaxed his thoughts and went out and back to his
desk. He sat down and bent to his paperwork and tried not to
listen to the hastening tick of the Rolex on his wrist, tried to
fix in his mind the rough geography of the Gloria Run he had
inadequately learned from the metal map. It was too late
now to go and have another look at it. He must stay put and
continue to play the toothless tiger!</p>

<p class="line10">*          *          *</p>

<p class="pindent">Dinner was as ghastly as lunch. Bond concentrated on
getting plenty of whisky and food under his belt. He made
urbane conversation and pretended he didn’t notice the chill
in the air. Then he gave Ruby’s foot one warm press under
the table, excused himself on the grounds of work, and
strode with dignity out of the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had changed for dinner and he was relieved to find his
ski-clothes in the half-tidy heap in which he had left them.
He went, with utter normalcy, about his work—sharpened
pencils, laid out his books, bent to the squared paper:
‘Simon de Bleuville, 1510-1570. Alphonse de Bleuville, 1546-1580,
married 1571 Mariette d’Escourt, and had issue, Jean,
Francoise, Pierre’. Thank God he would soon be released
from all this blether!</p>

<p class="pindent">9.15, 9.30, 9.45, 10! Bond felt the excitement ball up inside
him like cat’s fur. He found that his hands were wet. He
wiped them down the sides of his trousers. He got up and
stretched. He went into the bathroom and made appropriate
noises, retrieved the gloves, and laid them on the bathroom
floor just inside the door. Then, naked, he came back into the
room and got into bed and switched off the light. He regularized
his breathing and, in ten minutes, began to snore softly.
He gave it another ten, then slid out of bed and, with infinite
precaution, dressed himself in his ski clothes. He softly
retrieved his gloves from the bathroom, put on the goggles
so that they rested in his hair above the forehead, tied the
dark-red handkerchief tightly across his nose, schnapps into
pocket, passport into hip-pocket and, finally, Gillette through
the fingers of the left hand and the Rolex transferred to his
right, the bracelet clasped in the palm of his hand and round
the fingers so that the face of the watch lay across his middle
knuckles.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond paused and ran over his equipment. The ski-gloves,
their cord drawn through his sweater and down the
sleeves, hung from his wrists. They would be a hindrance
until he was outside. Nothing to be done about that. The rest
was all right. He was set! He bent to the door, manipulated
the lock with the plastic and, praying that the television eye
had been closed down and would not see the light shining
in from the passage, listened briefly and slipped out.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was, as usual, light from the reception room to his
left. Bond crept along, inched round the door jamb. Yes!
The guard was there, bent over something that looked like a
time sheet. The neck was offered. Bond dropped the Gillette
in his pocket and stiffened the fingers of his left hand into the
old Commando cutting edge. He took the two steps into the
room and crashed the hand down on the back of the offered
neck. The man’s face hit the table top with a thud, bounced
up, and half turned towards Bond. Bond’s right flashed out
and the face of the Rolex disintegrated against the man’s
jaw. The body slid sluggishly off its chair on to the carpet
and lay still, its legs untidy as if in sleep. The eyes fluttered
and stared, unseeing, upwards. Bond went round the desk
and bent down. There was no heartbeat. Bond straightened
himself. It was the man he had seen coming back alone from
the bob-run on his first morning, when Bertil had met with
his accident. So! Rough justice!</p>

<p class="pindent">The telephone on the desk buzzed like a trapped wasp.
Bond looked at it. He picked up the receiver and spoke
through the handkerchief across his mouth. ‘Ja?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Alles in Ordnung?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ja.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Also hör zu! Wir kommen für den Engländer in zehn
Minuten. Verstanden?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Is’ recht.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Also, aufpassen. Ja?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Zu Befehl!’</p>

<p class="pindent">At the other end the receiver went down. The sweat was
beading on Bond’s face. Thank God he had answered! So
they were coming for him in ten minutes! There was a
bunch of keys on the desk. Bond snatched them up and ran
to the front door. After three misfits, he had the right one.
He tried the door. It was now only held by its air-pressure
device. Bond leaped for the ski-room. Unlocked! He went
in and, by the light from the reception room, found his skis.
There were sticks beside them. Carefully he lifted everything
out of its wooden slot and strode to the main door
and opened it. He laid the skis and sticks softly down in the
snow, turned back to the door, locked it from the outside,
and threw the keys far away into the snow.</p>

<p class="pindent">The three-quarter moon burned down with an almost
dazzling fire and the snow crystals scintillated back at it like
a carpet of diamond dust. Now minutes would have to be
wasted getting the bindings absolutely right. James Bond
kicked one boot into the groove of the Marker toe-hold and
knelt down, feeling for the steel cable that went behind his
heel. It was too short. Coolly, unhurriedly, he adjusted the
regulating screw on the forward latch and tried again. This
time it was all right. He pressed down on the safety latch
and felt it lock his boot into the toe-hold. Next, the safety
thong round the top of his boot that would keep the ski
prisoner if the latch sprung, which it would do with a fall.
His fingers were beginning to freeze. The tip of the thong
refused to find its buckle! A full minute wasted! Got it!
And now the same job on the other ski. At last Bond stood
up, slipped the gloves over his aching fingers, picked up the
lance-like sticks, and pushed himself off along the faint ridge
that showed the outlines of yesterday’s well trodden path.
It felt all right! He pulled the goggles down over his eyes
and now the vast snowscape was a silvery green as if he was
swimming under sunny water. The skis hissed smoothly
through the powder snow. Bond tried to get up more speed
down the gentle slope by langlaufing, the sliding, forward
stride of the first Norwegian skiers. But it didn’t work.
The heels of his boots felt nailed to the skis. He punted
himself forward as fast as he could with his sticks. God,
what a trail he must be leaving—like a tram-line! As soon as
they got the front door open, they would be after him. Their
fastest guide would certainly catch him easily unless he got a
good start! Every minute, every second was a bonus. He
passed between the black outlines of the cable head and the
Berghaus. There was the starting point of the Gloria Run,
the metal notices beside it hatted with snow! Bond didn’t
pause. He went straight for it and over the edge.</p>

<p class="pindent">The first vertical drop had a spine-chilling bliss to it.
Bond got down into his old Arlberg crouch, his hands
forward of his boots, and just let himself go. His skis were
an ugly six inches apart. The Kannonen he had watched had
gone down with their boots locked together, as if on a single
ski. But this was no time for style, even if he had been
capable of it! Above all he must stay upright!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s speed was now frightening. But the deep cushion
of cold, light powder snow gave him the confidence to try a
parallel swing. Minimum of shoulder turn needed at this
speed—weight on to the left ski—and he came round and
held it as the right-hand edges of his skis bit against the
slope, throwing up a shower of moonlit snow crystals.
Danger was momentarily forgotten in the joy of speed,
technique, and mastery of the snow. Bond straightened up
and almost dived into his next turn, this time to the left,
leaving a broad S on the virgin mountain behind him. Now
he could afford to schuss the rest down to the hard left-hand
turn round the shoulder. He pointed his skis down and felt
real rapture as, like a black bullet on the giant slope, he
zoomed down the 45-degree drop. Now for the left-hand
corner. There was the group of three flags, black, red, and
yellow, hanging limply, their colours confused by the moonlight!
He would have to stop there and take a recce over the
next lap. There was a slight upward slope short of the big
turn. Bond took it at speed, felt his skis leave the ground at
the crest of it, jabbed into the snow with his left stick as an
extra lever and threw his skis and his right shoulder and
hips round to the left. He landed in a spray of snow, at a dead
halt. He was delighted with himself! A Sprung-Christiana
is a showy and not an easy turn at speed. He wished his old
teacher, Fuchs, had been there to see that one!</p>

<p class="pindent">He was now on the shoulder of the mountain. High overhead
the silver strands of the cable railway plunged downwards
in one great swoop towards the distant black line of
the trees, where the moonlight glinted on a spidery pylon.
Bond remembered that there now followed a series of great
zigs and zags more or less beneath the cables. With the piste
unobscured, it would have been easy, but the new snow made
every descent look desirable. Bond jerked up his goggles to
see if he could spot a flag. Yes, there was one away down
to the left. He would do some S turns down the next slope
and then make for it.</p>

<p class="pindent">As he pulled down his goggles and gripped his sticks, two
things happened. First there came a deep boom from high
up the mountain, and a speck of flame, that wobbled in its
flight, soared into the sky above him. There was a pause at
the top of its parabola, a sharp crack, and a blazing magnesium
flare on a parachute began its wandering descent,
wiping out the black shadows in the hollows, turning everything
into a hideous daylight. Another and another sprayed
out across the sky, lighting every cranny over the mountain
side.</p>

<p class="pindent">And, at the same time, the cables high above Bond’s head
began to sing! They were sending the cable car down after
him!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond cursed into the sodden folds of his silk handkerchief
and got going. The next thing would be a man after him—probably
a man with a gun!</p>

<p class="pindent">He took the second lap more carefully than the first, got
across to the second flag, turned at it and made back across
the plunging slope for the series of linked S’s under the
cables. How fast did these bloody gondolas go? Ten, fifteen,
twenty miles an hour? This was the latest type. It would be
the fastest. Hadn’t he read somewhere that the one between
Arosa and the Weisshorn did 25? Even as he got into his first
S, the tune of the singing cable above him momentarily
changed and then went back to its usual whine. That was the
gondola passing the first pylon! Bond’s knees, the Achilles
heel of all skiers, were beginning to ache. He cut his S’s
narrower, snaking down faster, but now feeling the rutted
tracks of the piste under his skis at every turn. Was that a
flag away over to the left? The magnesium flares were swaying
lower, almost directly over him. Yes. It looked all right.
Two more S turns and he would do a traverse schuss to it!</p>

<p class="pindent">Something landed with a tremendous crack amidst a fountain
of snow to his right! Another to his left! They had a
grenade-thrower up front in the cable car! A bracket! Would
the next one be dead on? Almost before the thought flashed
through his mind, there came a tremendous explosion just
ahead of him and he was hurled forward and sideways in a
catherine wheel of sticks and skis.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got gingerly to his feet, gasping and spitting snow.
One of his bindings had opened. His trembling fingers
found the forward latch and banged it tight again. Another
sharp crack, but wide by twenty yards. He must get away
from the line of fire from the blasted railway! Feverishly he
thought, the left-hand flag! I must do the traverse now. He
took a vague bearing across the precipitous slope and flung
himself down it.</p>
