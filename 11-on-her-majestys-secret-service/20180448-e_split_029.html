<p class="line7"><span class="sc"><span class="gesp">Yes! There</span></span> was the bloody place! Now only the peak was
golden. The plateau and the buildings were in indigo shadow,
soon to be lit by the full moon.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond pointed. The helicopter wasn’t liking the altitude.
At 10,000 feet its rotors were finding it hard to get a grip
of the thin air and the pilot was struggling to keep it at maximum
revs. As he turned to port, in towards the face of the
mountain, his radio crackled sharply and a harsh voice said,
in German and then in French, ‘Landing forbidden. This is
private property. I repeat, landing forbidden!’ The pilot
reached up to the cockpit roof and switched off the radio.
He had studied his landing-point on the plateau on the
mock-up. He got to it, hovered, and gently came down. The
helicopter bounced once on its rubber floats and settled.
Already there was a group of men waiting for them. Eight
men. Bond recognized some of them. They all had their
hands in their pockets or in their wind-jackets. The engine
coughed to a stop and the rotors swung round briefly in
neutral and halted. Bond heard the bang of the door being
opened behind him and the rattle of the men piling down the
ladder. The two groups lined up facing each other. Marc-Ange
said, with authority, ‘This is the Federal Police Alpine
Patrol. There was trouble up here on Christmas Eve. We
have come to investigate.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Fritz, the ‘head waiter’, said angrily, ‘The local police
have already been here. They have made their report. All is
in order. Please leave at once. What is the Federal Police
Alpine Patrol? I have never heard of it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The pilot nudged Bond and pointed over to the left, to
the building that housed the Count and the laboratories. A
man, clumsy in bob-sleigh helmet and padding, was running
down the path towards the cable station. He would be out of
sight of the men on the ground. Bond said ‘Blast!’ and
scrambled out of his seat and into the cabin. He leaned out of
the door and shouted, ‘The Big One. He’s getting away!’</p>

<p class="pindent">As Bond jumped, one of the <span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">SPECTRE</span></span> men shouted, ‘Der
Engländer, Der Spion!’ And then, as Bond started running
away to the right, weaving and dodging, all hell broke loose.
There came the boom of heavy automatics as the <span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">SPECTRE</span></span>
team got off their first rounds, and bullets, tracer, flashed
past Bond with the noise of humming-birds’ wings. Then
came the answering roar of the Schmeissers and Bond was
left alone.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now he was round the corner of the club, and, a hundred
yards down the slope, the man in the crash helmet had torn
open the door of the ‘garage’ for the bob-sleighs in the
foundations of the cable station. He emerged carrying a one-man
skeleton bob. Holding it in front of him as a shield, he
fired a burst from a heavy automatic at Bond and again the
humming-birds whirred past. Bond knelt and, steadying his
gun with two hands, fired three rounds with his Walther,
but the man was now running the few yards to the glistening
ice-mouth of the Gloria Express bob-run. Bond got a glimpse
of the profile under the moon. Yes, it was Blofeld all right!
Even as Bond ran on down the slope, the man had flung
himself down on his skeleton and had disappeared as if
swallowed up by the glistening landscape. Bond got to the
‘garage’. Damn, they were all six-men or two-men models!
No, there was one skeleton at the back! Bond hauled it out.
No time to see if the runners were straight, the steering-arm
shifting easily! He ran to the start and hurled himself under
the protecting chain in a mad forward dive that landed him
half on and half off his skeleton. He straightened himself and
shifted his body well forward on the flimsy little aluminium
platform and gripped the steering-arm, keeping his elbows
well in to his sides. He was already going like hell down the
dark-blue gutter! He tried braking with the toes of both his
boots. Damned little difference! What came first on the
blasted run? There was this lateral straight across the
shoulder of the mountain, then a big banked curve. He was
into it now! Bond kept his right shoulder down and inched
right on the steering-arm. Even so, he went perilously near
the top edge of the bank before he dived down into the dark
gully again. What came next on that metal map? Why in hell
hadn’t he studied it more carefully? He got his answer! It
looked like a straight, but the shadows camouflaged a sharp
dip. Bond left the ground and flew. The crash of his landing
almost knocked the wind out of his body. He frantically dug
his toes into the ice, managed to get down from perhaps
fifty m.p.h. to forty. Well, well! So that was ‘Dead Man’s
Leap.’ What in hell was the next bit of murder? ‘Whizz-Bang
Straight’! And by God it was!—200 yards when he
must have been doing around seventy. He remembered that
on the finishing straight of the Cresta the stars got up to
over eighty. No doubt something like that was still to come!
But now, flashing towards him, in silver and black, came an
S-bend—‘Battling S’. The toes of Bond’s boots slid maddeningly
on the black ice. Under his nose he could see the
parallel tracks of Blofeld’s runners and, between them, the
grooves of his toe-spikes. The old fox! As soon as he heard
the helicopter, he must have got himself fixed for his only
escape route. But at this speed Bond must surely be catching
up with him! For God’s sake look out! Here comes the S!
There was nothing he could do about it. He swayed his body
as best he could, felt the searing crash of one elbow against
one wall, was hurled across into the opposite one, and was
then spewed out into the straight again. God Almighty, but it
hurt! He could feel the cold wind on both elbows. The cloth
had gone! Then so had the skin! Bond clenched his teeth.
And he was only half-way down, if that! But then, ahead,
flashing through a patch of moonlight, was the other body,
Blofeld! Bond took a chance, heaved himself up on one hand
and reached down for his gun. The wind tried to tear him off
the bob, but he had the gun. He opened his mouth wide and
gripped the gun between his teeth, flexed the ice-caked leather
on his right hand. Then he got the gun in his right hand,
lifted his toes off the ice, and went like hell. But now the man
had disappeared into the shadows and a giant bank reared up
ahead. This would be ‘Hell’s Delight’! Oh well, if he could
make this, there would be another straight and he could begin
shooting. Bond dug his toes in, got a glimpse of an ice-wall
ahead and to the left, and in a flash was climbing it, straight
up! God, in a split second he would be over the edge! Bond
hammered in his right boot and lurched his body to the
right, tearing at the steering-arm. Reluctantly the sliver of
aluminium answered and Bond, inches from the top of the
wall, found himself swooping down into blackness and then
out again on to a moonlit straight. Only fifty yards ahead was
the flying figure, with chips of ice fountaining up from the
braking spikes on his boots. Bond held his breath and got
off two shots. He thought they were good ones, but now the
man had gone into shadow again. But Bond was gaining,
gaining. His lips drew back from his teeth in an almost
animal snarl. You bastard! You’re a dead duck! You can’t
stop or fire back. I’m coming after you like lightning! Soon I
shall only be ten, five yards behind you. Then you’ll have
had it!</p>

<p class="pindent">But the shadows concealed another hazard, long transverse
waves in the ice—‘The Boneshaker’! Bond crashed from
one to the next, felt his boots being almost torn from his feet
as he tried to brake, nearly lost his gun, felt his stomach
flatten against his spine with each shattering impact, felt his
rib cage almost cracking. But then it was over and Bond
sucked in air through his clenched teeth. Now for a length of
straight! But what was that ahead on the track? It was something
black, something the size of a big lemon that was
bouncing along gaily like a child’s rubber ball. Had Blofeld,
now only about thirty yards ahead, dropped something, a
bit of his equipment? <span class="it">Had he?</span> The realization came to Bond
in a surge of terror that almost made him vomit. He ground
his toes into the ice. No effect! He was gaining on the gaily
bouncing thing. Flashing down on it. On the grenade!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond, sick in the stomach, lifted his toes and let himself go.
What setting had Blofeld put on it? How long had he held
it with the pin out? The only hope was to pray to God and
race it!</p>

<p class="pindent">The next thing Bond knew was that the whole track had
blown-up in his face and that he and his skeleton bob were
flying through the air. He landed in soft snow, with the
skeleton on top of him and passed out like a light.</p>

<p class="pindent">Later, Bond was to estimate that he lay there only a matter
of minutes. It was a tremendous explosion from the mountain
above him that brought him staggering to his feet, up to his
belly in snow. He looked vaguely up to where it had come
from. It must have been the club building going up, because
now there was the glare of flames and a tower of smoke that
rose towards the moon. There came the echoing crack of
another explosion and Blofeld’s block disintegrated, great
chunks of it crashing down the mountain side, turning themselves
into giant snowballs that bounded off down towards
the tree-line. By God, they’ll start another avalanche! thought
Bond vaguely. Then he realized that it didn’t matter this
time, he was away to the right, almost underneath the cable
railway. And now the station went up and Bond stared
fascinated as the great wires, their tension released, came
hissing and snaking down the mountain towards him. There
was nothing he could do about it but stand and watch. If they
cut him down, they cut him down. But they lashed past in the
snow, wrapped themselves briefly round the tall pylon above
the tree-line, tore it away in a metallic crackling, and disappeared
over the edge of the shoulder.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed weakly with pleasure and began feeling
himself for damage. His torn elbows he already knew about,
but his forehead hurt like hell. He felt it gingerly, then
scooped up a handful of snow and held it against the wound.
The blood showed black in the moonlight. He ached all over,
but there didn’t seem to be anything broken. He bent dazedly
to the twisted remains of the skeleton. The steering-arm had
gone, had probably saved his head, and both runners were
bent. There were a lot of rattles from the rivets, but perhaps
the damned thing would run. It had bloody well got to!
There was no other way for Bond to get down the mountain!
His gun? Gone to hell, of course. Wearily Bond heaved himself
over the wall of the track and slid carefully down,
clutching the remains of his skeleton. As soon as he got to the
bottom of the gutter, everything began to slip downwards,
but he managed to haul himself on to the bob and get shakily
going. In fact, the bent runners were a blessing and the bob
scraped slowly down, leaving great furrows in the ice. There
were more turns, more hazards, but, at a bare ten miles an
hour, they were child’s play and soon Bond was through the
tree-line and into ‘Paradise Alley’, the finishing straight,
where he slowly came to a halt. He left the skeleton where it
stopped and scrambled over the low ice-wall. Here the snow
was beaten hard by spectators’ feet and he stumbled slowly
along, nursing his aches, and occasionally dabbing at his head
with handfuls of snow. What would he find at the bottom,
by the cable station? If it was Blofeld, Bond would be a dead
duck! But there were no lights on in the station into which
the cables now trailed limply along the ground. By God,
that had been an expensive bang! But what of Marc-Ange
and his merry men, and the helicopter?</p>

<p class="pindent">As if to answer him, he heard the clatter of its engine
high up in the mountains and in a moment the ungainly
black shape crossed the moon and disappeared down the
valley. Bond smiled to himself. They were going to have a
tough time arguing themselves across Swiss air-space this
time! But Marc-Ange had thought out an alternative route
over Germany. That would also not be fun. They would
have to argue the toss with NATO? Well, if a Marseillais
couldn’t blarney his way across two hundred miles, nobody
could!</p>

<p class="pindent">And now, up the road from Samaden that Bond knew
so well, came the iron hee-haw warning of the local fire-engine.
The blinking red light on its cabin roof was perhaps
a mile away. Bond, carefully approaching the corner of the
darkened cable station, prepared his story. He crept up to the
wall of the building and looked round. Nobody! No trace
except fresh tyre-marks outside the entrance door. Blofeld
must have telephoned his man down here before he started
and used him and his car for the getaway. Which way had he
gone? Bond walked out on to the road. The tracks turned
left. Blofeld would be at the Bernina Pass or over it by now,
on his way down into Italy and away. It might still have been
possible to have him held at the frontier by alerting the fire-brigade,
whose lights now held Bond in their beam. No!
That would be idiotic. How had Bond got this knowledge
unless he himself had been up at Piz Gloria that night? No,
he must just play the part of the stupidest tourist in the
Engadine!</p>

<p class="pindent">The shining red vehicle pulled up in front of the cable
station and the warning klaxons ran down with an iron
groan. Men jumped to the ground. Some went into the
station while others stood gazing up at the Piz Gloria, where
a dull red glow still showed. A man in a peaked cap, presumably
the captain of the team, came up to Bond and
saluted. He fired off a torrent of Schwyzerdütsch. Bond shook
his head. The man tried French. Bond again showed incomprehension.
Another man with fragmentary English was
called over. ‘What is it that is happening?’ he asked.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shook his head dazedly. ‘I don’t know. I was walking
down from Pontresina to Samaden. I came on a day excursion
from Zürich and missed my bus. I was going to take a train
from Samaden. Then I saw these explosions up the mountain—he
waved vaguely—‘and I walked up there past the station
to see better, and the next thing I knew was a bang on the
head and being dragged along the path.’ He indicated his
bleeding head and the raw elbows that protruded from his
torn sleeves. ‘It must have been the broken cable. It must
have hit me and dragged me with it. Have you got a Red Cross
outfit with you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, yes.’ The man called over to the group, and one
of his colleagues wearing a Red Cross brassard on his arm
fetched his black box from the vehicle and came over. He
clucked his tongue over Bond’s injuries and, while his
interrogator told Bond’s story to the Captain, bade Bond
follow him into the toilette in the station. There, by the
light of a torch, he washed Bond’s wounds, applied quantities
of iodine that stung like hell, and then strapped wide strips
of Elastoplast over the damage. Bond looked at his face in
the mirror. He laughed. Hell of a bridegroom he was going
to make! The Red Cross man cluck-clucked in sympathy,
produced a flask of brandy out of his box, and offered it to
Bond. Bond gratefully took a long swig. The interpreter came
in. ‘There is nothing we can do here. It will need a helicopter
from the mountain rescue team. We must go back to Samaden
and report. You wish to come?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I certainly do,’ said Bond enthusiastically, and, with many
politenesses and no question of why he should attempt the
icy walk to Samaden in the dark instead of taking a taxi, he
was borne comfortably to Samaden and dropped off, with
the warmest gestures of goodwill and sympathy, at the railway
station.</p>

<p class="line10">*          *          *</p>

<p class="pindent">By a rattling Personenzug to Coire and then by express to
Zürich, Bond got to the door of the flat of Head of Station Z
in the Bahnhofstrasse at two in the morning. He had had
some sleep in the train but he was almost out on his feet,
and his whole body felt as if it had been beaten with wooden
truncheons. He leaned wearily against the bell ticketed
‘Muir’ until a tousled man in pyjamas came and opened the
door and held it on the chain. ‘Um Gottes Willen! Was ist
denn los?’ he inquired angrily. The English accent came
through. Bond said, ‘It’s me that’s “los”. It’s 007 again,
I’m afraid.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good God, man, come in, come in!’ Muir opened the
door and looked quickly up and down the empty street.
‘Anyone after you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Shouldn’t think so,’ said Bond thickly, coming gratefully
into the warmth of the entrance hall. Head of Z closed the
door and locked it. He turned and looked at Bond. ‘Christ,
old boy, what in hell’s been happening to you? You look as
if you’d been through a mangle. Here, come in and have a
drink,’ He led the way into a comfortable sitting-room. He
gestured at the sideboard. ‘Help yourself. I’ll just tell Phyllis
not to worry—unless you’d like her to have a look at the
damage. She’s quite a hand at that sort of thing.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No, it’s all right, thanks. A drink’ll fix me. Nice and warm
in here. I never want to see a patch of snow again as long as
I live.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Muir went out and Bond heard a quick confabulation
across the passage. Muir came back. ‘Phyllis is fixing the
spare room. She’ll put some fresh dressings and stuff out
in the bathroom. Now then’—he poured himself a thin
whisky and soda to keep Bond company and sat down
opposite him—‘tell me what you can.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, ‘I’m terribly sorry, but I can’t tell you much.
The same business as the other day. Next chapter. I promise
you’d do better to know nothing about it. I wouldn’t have
come here only I’ve got to get a signal off to M, personal,
triple X cipher to be deciphered by recipient only. Would
you be a good chap and put it on the printer?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course.’ Muir looked at his watch. ‘Two-thirty a.m.
Hell of a time to wake the old man up. But that’s your
business. Here, come into the cockpit, so to speak.’ He
walked across to the book-lined wall, took out a book and
fiddled. There was a click and a small door swung open.
‘Mind your head,’ said Muir. ‘Old disused lavatory. Just
the right size. Gets a bit stuffy when there’s a lot of traffic
coming or going, but that can’t be helped. We can afford
to leave the door open.’ He bent down to a safe on the floor,
worked the combination, and brought out what looked like a
portable typewriter. He set it on the shelf next to the bulky
teleprinter, sat down, and clacked off the prefix and routing
instructions, winding a small handle at the side of the
machine at the end of each word. ‘OK. Fire away!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond leaned up against the wall. He had toyed with various
formulas on his journey down to Samaden. It had to be
something that would get through accurately to M and yet
keep Muir in the dark, keep his hands clean. Bond said,
‘All right. Make it this, would you? <span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">REDOUBT</span></span>
<span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">PROPERLY FIXED STOP DETAILS LACKING AS EYE WENT SOLO AFTER THE OWNER WHO</span></span>
<span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">GREATLY REGRET GOT AWAY AND PROBABLY ITALICIZED BY NOW STOP FORWARDING</span></span>
<span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">FULL REPORT FROM STATION M THEN GRATEFULLY ACCEPTING TEN DAYS LEAVE</span></span>
<span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">SIGNED 007.</span></span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">Muir repeated the signal and then began putting it, in
the five-figure groups that had come off the Triple X
machine, on to the teleprinter.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond watched the message go, the end of another chapter
of his duties, as Marc-Ange had put it, ‘On Her Majesty’s
Secret Service’. What would Her Majesty think of this string
of crimes committed in her name? God, it was stuffy in the
little room! Bond felt the cold sweat break out on his forehead.
He put his hand up to his face, muttered something
indistinctly about ‘that bloody mountain’ and gracefully
crumpled to the floor.</p>
