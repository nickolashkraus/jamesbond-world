<p class="pindent">James Bond said the words at ten-thirty in the morning of a
crystal-clear New Year’s Day in the British Consul General’s
drawing-room.</p>

<p class="pindent">And he meant them.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Consul General had proved himself, as British Consuls
so often do, to be a man of efficiency and a man with a heart.
It was a holiday for him and, as he confessed, he should have
been recovering from a New Year’s Eve hangover. And he
had shaved many days off the formal period of notice, but
that, he explained, he had occasionally, and improperly,
risked in his career if there were exceptional circumstances
such as the imminent death of either party. ‘You both look
healthy enough,’ he had said when they first visited him
together, ‘but that’s a nasty cut on your head, Commander
Bond, and the Countess is perhaps looking a little pale. And
I have taken the precaution of obtaining special dispensation
from the Foreign Secretary, which I may say, to my surprise,
was immediately forthcoming. So let’s make it New Year’s
Day. And come to my home. My wife is hopelessly sentimental
about these occasional jobs I have to do, and I know
she’d love to meet you both.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The papers were signed, and Head of Station M, who had
agreed to act as Bond’s best man and who was secretly longing
to write a sensational note to the head of his London Section
about all this, produced a handful of confetti and threw most
of it over Marc-Ange, who had turned up in a ‘cylindre’
and a full suit of very French tails with, surprisingly, two
rows of medals of which the last, to Bond’s astonishment,
was the King’s Medal for foreign resistance-fighters.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I will tell you all about it one day, my dear James,’
he had said in answer to Bond’s admiring inquiry. ‘It was
tremendous fun. I had myself what the Americans call “a
ball”. And’—his voice sank to a whisper and he put one
finger along his brown, sensitive nose—‘I confess that I
profited by the occasion to lay my hands on the secret funds
of a certain section of the Abwehr. But Herkos Odonton,
my dear James! Herkos Odonton! Medals are so often just
the badges of good luck. If I am a hero, it is for things for
which no medals are awarded. And’—he drew lines with his
fingers across his chest—‘there is hardly room on the breast
of this “frac”, which, by the way, is by courtesy of the
excellent Galeries Barbès in Marseilles, for all that I am due
under that heading.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The farewells were said and Bond submitted himself, he
swore for the last time, to Marc-Ange’s embraces, and they
went down the steps to the waiting Lancia. Someone, Bond
suspected the Consul’s wife, had tied white ribbons from the
corners of the wind-screen to the grill of the radiator, and
there was a small group of bystanders, passers-by, who had
stopped, as they do all over the world, to see who it was, what
they looked like.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Consul General shook Bond by the hand. ‘I’m afraid
we haven’t managed to keep this as private as you’d have
liked. A woman reporter came on from the <span class="it">Münchener
Illustrierte</span> this morning. Wouldn’t say who she was. Gossip-writer,
I suppose. I had to give her the bare facts. She particularly
wanted to know the time of the ceremony, if you
can call it that, so that they could send a camera-man along.
At least you’ve been spared that. All still tight, I suppose.
Well, so long and the best of luck.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Tracy, who had elected to ‘go away’ in a dark-grey Tyroler
outfit with the traditional dark-green trimmings and stag’s-horn
buttons, threw her saucy mountaineer’s hat with its
gay chamois’ beard cockade into the back seat, climbed in,
and pressed the starter. The engine purred and then roared
softly as she went through the gears down the empty street.
They both waved one hand out of a window and Bond,
looking back, saw Marc-Ange’s ‘cylindre’ whirling up into
the air. There was a small flutter of answering hands from
the pavement and then they were round the corner and
away.</p>

<p class="pindent">When they found the Autobahn exit for Salzburg and
Kufstein, Bond said, ‘Be an angel and pull in to the side,
Tracy. I’ve got two things to do.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She pulled in on to the grass verge. The brown grass of
winter showed through the thin snow. Bond reached for her
and took her in his arms. He kissed her tenderly. ‘That’s
the first thing, and I just wanted to say that I’ll look after you,
Tracy. Will you mind being looked after?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She held him away from her and looked at him. She
smiled. Her eyes were introspective. ‘That’s what it means
being Mr and Mrs, doesn’t it? They don’t say Mrs and Mr.
But <span class="it">you</span> need looking after too. Let’s just look after each
other.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right. But I’d rather have my job than yours. Now.
I simply must get out and take down those ribbons. I can’t
stand looking like a coronation. D’you mind?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She laughed. ‘You like being anonymous. I want everyone
to cheer as we go by. I know you’re going to have this car
sprayed grey or black as soon as you get a chance. That’s all
right. But nothing’s going to stop me wearing you like a flag
from now on. Will you sometimes feel like wearing me like a
flag?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘On all holidays and feast days.’ Bond got out and removed
the ribbons. He looked up at the cloudless sky. The
sun felt warm on his face. He said, ‘Do you think we’d
be too cold if we took the roof down?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No, let’s. We can only see half the world with it up. And
it’s a lovely drive from here to Kitzbühel. We can always
put it up again if we want to.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond unscrewed the two butterfly nuts and folded the
canvas top back behind the seats. He had a look up and down
the Autobahn. These was plenty of traffic. At the big Shell
station on the roundabout they had just passed, his eye was
caught by a bright-red open Maserati being tanked up. Fast
job. And a typical sporty couple, a man and a woman in the
driving-seat—white dust-coats and linen helmets buttoned
under the chin. Big dark-green talc goggles that obscured
most of the rest of the faces. Usual German speedsters’
uniform. Too far away to see if they were good-looking
enough for the car, but the silhouette of the woman wasn’t
promising. Bond got in beside Tracy and they set off again
down the beautifully landscaped road.</p>

<p class="pindent">They didn’t talk much. Tracy kept at about eighty and
there was wind-roar. That was the trouble about open cars.
Bond glanced at his watch. 11.45. They would get to Kufstein
at about one. There was a splendid Gasthaus up the winding
streets towards the great castle. Here was a tiny lane of
pleasure, full of the heart-plucking whine of zither music
and the gentle melancholy of Tyrolean yodellers. It was here
that the German tourist traditionally stopped after his day’s
outing into cheap Austria, just outside the German frontier,
for a last giant meal of Austrian food and wine. Bond put his
mouth up close to Tracy’s ear and told her about it and
about the other attraction at Kufstein—the most imaginative
war memorial, for the 1914-18 war, ever devised. Punctually
at midday every day, the windows of the castle are thrown
open and a voluntary is played on the great organ inside.
It can be heard for kilometres down the valley between the
giant mountain ranges for which Kufstein provides the gateway.
‘But we shall miss it. It’s coming up for twelve now.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Never mind,’ said Tracy, ‘I’ll make do with the zithers
while you guzzle your beer and schnapps.’ She turned in to
the right-hand fork leading to the underpass for Kufstein,
and they were at once through Rosenheim and the great white
peaks were immediately ahead.</p>

<p class="pindent">The traffic was much sparser now and there were kilometres
where theirs was the only car on the road that arrowed
away between white meadows and larch copses, towards the
glittering barrier where blood had been shed between warring
armies for centuries. Bond glanced behind him. Miles away
down the great highway was a speck of red. The Maserati?
They certainly hadn’t got much competitive spirit if they
couldn’t catch the Lancia at eighty! No good having a car
like that if you didn’t drive it so as to lose all other traffic in
your mirror. Perhaps he was doing them an injustice. Perhaps
they too only wanted to motor quietly along and enjoy the
day.</p>

<p class="pindent">Ten minutes later, Tracy said, ‘There’s a red car coming
up fast behind. Do you want me to lose him?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No,’ said Bond. ‘Let him go. We’ve got all the time in the
world.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Now he could hear the rasping whine of the eight cylinders.
He leaned over to the left and jerked a laconic thumb forwards,
waving the Maserati past.</p>

<p class="pindent">The whine changed to a shattering roar. The wind-screen
of the Lancia disappeared as if hit by a monster fist. Bond
caught a glimpse of a taut, snarling mouth under a syphilitic
nose, the flash-eliminator of some automatic gun being withdrawn,
and then the red car was past and the Lancia was
going like hell off the verge across a stretch of snow and
smashing a path through a young copse. Then Bond’s head
crashed into the wind-screen frame and he was out.</p>

<p class="pindent">When he came to, a man in the khaki uniform of the Autobahn
Patrol was shaking him. The young face was stark with
horror. ‘Was ist denn geschehen? Was ist denn geschehen?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned towards Tracy. She was lying forward with
her face buried in the ruins of the steering-wheel. Her pink
handkerchief had come off and the bell of golden hair hung
down and hid her face. Bond put his arm round her shoulders,
across which the dark patches had begun to flower.</p>

<p class="pindent">He pressed her against him. He looked up at the young
man and smiled his reassurance.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s all right,’ he said in a clear voice as if explaining
something to a child. ‘It’s quite all right. She’s having a rest.
We’ll be going on soon. There’s no hurry. You see—’ Bond’s
head sank down against hers and he whispered into her hair—‘you
see, we’ve got all the time in the world.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The young patrolman took a last scared look at the
motionless couple, hurried over to his motor cycle, picked up
the hand-microphone, and began talking urgently to the
rescue headquarters.</p>
