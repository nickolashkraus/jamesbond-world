<p class="line7"><span class="sc"><span class="gesp">‘And who</span></span> the hell are <span class="it">you</span> supposed to be?’</p>

<p class="pindent">M more or less repeated Bond’s question when, that evening,
he looked up from the last page of the report that Bond
had spent the afternoon dictating to Mary Goodnight. M’s
face was just outside the pool of yellow light cast by the
green-shaded reading lamp on his desk, but Bond knew
that the lined, sailor’s face was reflecting, in varying degrees,
scepticism, irritation, and impatience. The ‘hell’ told him so.
M rarely swore and when he did it was nearly always at
stupidity. M obviously regarded Bond’s plan as stupid, and
now, away from the dedicated, minutely focused world of the
Heralds, Bond wasn’t sure that M wasn’t right.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m to be an emissary from the College of Arms, sir. This
Basilisk chap recommended that I should have some kind
of a title, the sort of rather highfalutin one that would impress
a man with this kind of bee in his bonnet. And Blofeld’s
obviously got this bee or he wouldn’t have revealed his
existence, even to such a presumably secure and—er—sort
of remote corner of the world as the College of Arms. I’ve
put down there the arguments of this chap and they make a
lot of sense to me. Snobbery’s a real Achilles heel with
people. Blofeld’s obviously got the bug badly. I think we can
get to him through it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, I think it’s all a pack of nonsense,’ said M testily.
(Not many years before, M had been awarded the KCMG
for his services, and Miss Moneypenny, his desirable secretary,
had revealed in a moment of candour to Bond that M
had not replied to a single one of the notes and letters of congratulation.
After a while he had refused even to read them
and had told Miss Moneypenny not to show him any more
but to throw them in the wastepaper basket.) ‘All right then,
what’s this ridiculous title to be? And what happens next?’</p>

<p class="pindent">If Bond had been able to blush, he would have blushed.
He said, ‘Er—well, sir, it seems there’s a chap called Sir
Hilary Bray. Friend of Sable Basilisk’s. About my age and
not unlike me to look at. His family came from some place
in Normandy. Family tree as long as your arm. William the
Conqueror and all that. And a coat of arms that looks like a
mixture between a jigsaw puzzle and Piccadilly Circus at
night. Well, Sable Basilisk says he can fix it with him. This
man’s got a good war record and sounds a reliable sort of
chap. He lives in some remote glen in the Highlands, watching
birds and climbing the hills with bare feet. Never sees a
soul. No reason why anyone in Switzerland should have
heard of him.’ Bond’s voice became defensive, stubborn.
‘Well, sir, the idea is that I should be him. Rather fancy
cover, but I think it makes sense.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sir Hilary Bray, eh?’ M tried to conceal his scorn. ‘And
then what do you do? Run around the Alps waving this
famous banner of his?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said patiently, obstinately, refusing to be browbeaten,
‘First I’ll get Passport Control to fix up a good
passport. Then I mug up Bray’s family tree until I’m word-perfect
on the thing. Then I swot away at the rudiments of
this heraldry business. Then, if Blofeld takes the bait, I go
out to Switzerland with all the right books and suggest that I
work out his de Bleuville pedigree with him.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Then what?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Then I try and winkle him out of Switzerland, get him
over the frontier to somewhere where we can do a kidnap
job on him, rather like the Israelis did with Eichmann. But I
haven’t worked out all the details yet, sir. Had to get your
approval and then Sable Basilisk has got to make up a damned
attractive fly and throw it over these Zürich solicitors.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Why not try putting pressure on the Zürich solicitors and
winkle Blofeld’s address out of them? Then we might think
of doing some kind of a commando job.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You know the Swiss, sir. God knows what kind of a
retainer these lawyers have from Blofeld. But it’s bound to
be millionaire size. We might eventually get the address,
but they’d be bound to tip-off Blofeld if only to lay their
hands on their fees before he vamoosed. Money’s the religion
of Switzerland.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I don’t need a lecture on the qualities of the Swiss, thank
you, 007. At least they keep their trains clean and cope with
the beatnik problem [two very rampant bees in M’s bonnet!],
but I daresay there’s some truth in what you say. Oh, well.’
M wearily pushed the file over to Bond. ‘Take it away.
It’s a messy-looking bird’s-nest of a plan. But I suppose it
had better go ahead.’ M shook his head sceptically. ‘Sir
Hilary Bray! Oh, well, tell the Chief of Staff I approve. But
reluctantly. Tell him you can have the facilities. Keep me
informed.’ M reached for the Cabinet telephone. His voice
was deeply disgruntled. ‘Suppose I’ll have to tell the PM
we’ve got a line on the chap. The kind of tangle it is, I’ll keep
to myself. That’s all, 007.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thank you, sir. Goodnight.’ As Bond went across to the
door he heard M say into the green receiver, ‘M speaking.
I want the Prime Minister personally, please.’ He might have
been asking for the mortuary. Bond went out and softly
closed the door behind him.</p>

<p class="line10">*          *          *</p>

<p class="pindent">So, as November blustered its way into December, James
Bond went unwillingly back to school, swotting up heraldry
at his desk instead of top-secret reports, picking up scraps
of medieval French and English, steeping himself in fusty
lore and myth, picking the brains of Sable Basilisk and
occasionally learning interesting facts, such as that the
founders of Gamages came from the de Gamaches in
Normandy and that Walt Disney was remotely descended
from the d’Isignys of the same part of France. But these were
nuggets in a wasteland of archaisms, and when, one day,
Mary Goodnight, in reply to some sally of his, addressed
him as ‘Sir Hilary’ he nearly bit her head off.</p>

<p class="pindent">Meanwhile the highly delicate correspondence between
Sable Basilisk and the Gebrüder Moosbrugger proceeded
haltingly and at a snail’s pace. They, or rather Blofeld behind
them, posed countless irritating but, Sable Basilisk admitted,
erudite queries each one of which had to be countered with
this or that degree of heraldic obfuscation. Then there were
minute questions about this emissary, Sir Hilary Bray.
Photographs were asked for, and, suitably doctored, were
provided. His whole career since his schooldays had to be
detailed and was sent down from Scotland with a highly
amused covering note from the real man. To test the market,
more funds were asked for by Sable Basilisk and, with encouraging
promptitude, were forthcoming in the shape of a
further thousand pounds. When the cheque arrived on
December 15th Sable Basilisk telephoned Bond delightedly.
‘We’ve got him,’ he said. ‘He’s hooked!’ And, sure enough,
the next day came a letter from Zürich to say that their client
agreed to a meeting with Sir Hilary. Would Sir Hilary please
arrive at Zürich Central Airport by Swissair flight Number
105, due at Zürich at 1300 hours on December 21st. On
Bond’s prompting, Sable Basilisk wrote back that the date
was not convenient to Sir Hilary owing to a prior engagement
with the Canadian High Commissioner regarding a detail in
the Arms of the Hudson’s Bay Company. Sir Hilary could,
however, manage the 22nd. By return came a cable agreeing
and, to Bond, confirming that the fish had not only swallowed
the hook but the line and sinker as well.</p>

<p class="pindent">The last few days were spent in a flurry of meetings,
with the Chief of Staff presiding, at Headquarters. The main
decisions were that Bond should go to the meeting with
Blofeld absolutely ‘clean’. He would carry no weapons, no
secret gear of any kind, and he would not be watched or
followed by the Service in any way. He would communicate
only with Sable Basilisk, getting across such information as
he could by using heraldic double talk (Sable Basilisk had
been cleared by MI5 immediately after Bond’s first meeting
with him), and Sable Basilisk, who vaguely thought that
Bond was employed by the Ministry of Defence, would be
given a cut-out at the Ministry who would be his go-between
with the Service. This was all assuming that Bond managed
to stay close to Blofeld for at least a matter of days. And
that was to be his basic stratagem. It was essential to find
out as much as possible about Blofeld, his activities and his
associates, in order to proceed with planning the next step,
his abduction from Switzerland. Physical action might not be
necessary. Bond might be able to trick the man into a visit
to Germany, as a result of a report which Sable Basilisk had
prepared of certain Blofeld family documents at the Augsburg
Zentral Archiv, which would need Blofeld’s personal
identification. Security precautions would include keeping
Station Z completely in the dark about Bond’s mission to
Switzerland and a closure of the ‘Bedlam’ file at Headquarters
which would be announced in the routine ‘Orders
of the Day’. Instead, a new code-word for the operation,
known only to an essential handful of senior officers, would
be issued. It would be ‘<span class="calibre2">CORONA</span>’.</p>

<p class="pindent">Finally, the personal dangers to Bond himself were discussed.
There was total respect for Blofeld at Headquarters.
Nobody questioned his abilities or his ruthlessness. If Bond’s
true identity somehow became known to Blofeld, Bond would
of course instantly be liquidated. A more dangerous and
likely event would be that, once Blofeld had probed Bond’s
heraldic gen to its rather shallow bottom and it had been
proved that he was or was not the Comte de Bleuville, Sir
Hilary Bray, his usefulness expended, might ‘meet with an
accident’. Bond would just have to face up to these hazards
and watch out particularly for the latter. He, and Sable
Basilisk behind him, would have to keep some tricks up their
sleeves, tricks that would somehow make Sir Hilary Bray’s
continued existence important to Blofeld. In conclusion, the
Chief of Staff said he considered the whole operation ‘a lot
of bezants’ and that ‘Bezants’ would have been a better
code-word than ‘Corona’. However, he wished Bond the
best of luck and said, cold-heartedly, that he would instruct
the Technical Section to proceed forthwith with the devising of
a consignment of explosive snowballs for Bond’s protection.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was on this cheery note that Bond, on the evening of
December 21st, returned to his office for a last run-through
of his documentation with Mary Goodnight.</p>

<p class="pindent">He sat sideways to his desk, looking out over the triste
winter twilight of Regent’s Park under snow, while she sat
opposite him and ran through the items: ‘<span class="it">Burke’s Extinct
and Dormant Baronetage</span>, property of the College of Heralds.
Stamped “Not to be removed from the Library”. The
printed <span class="it">Visitations in the College of Arms</span>, stamped ditto.
<span class="it">Genealogist’s Guide</span>, by G. W. Marshall, with Hatchard’s
receipted bill to Sable Basilisk inserted. <span class="it">Burke’s General
Armory</span>, stamped “Property of the London Library”,
wrapped and franked December 10th. Passport in the name
of Sir Hilary Bray, containing various recently-dated frontier
stamps in and out of France, Germany, and the Low
Countries, fairly well-used and dog-eared. One large file of
correspondence with Augsburg and Zürich on College of
Arms writing-paper and the writing-paper of the addressees.
And that’s the lot. You’ve fixed your laundry tags and so on?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ said Bond dully. ‘I’ve fixed all that. And I’ve got
two new suits with cuffs and double vents at the back and
four buttons down the front. Also a gold watch and chain
with the Bray seal. Quite the little baronet.’ Bond turned
and looked across the desk at Mary Goodnight. ‘What do you
think of this caper, Mary? Think it’ll come off?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, it should do,’ she said staunchly. ‘With all the
trouble that’s been taken. But’—she hesitated—‘I don’t
like you taking this man on without a gun.’ She waved a
hand at the pile on the floor. ‘And all these stupid books
about heraldry! It’s just not <span class="it">you</span>. You will take care, won’t
you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, I’ll do that all right,’ said Bond reassuringly. ‘Now,
be a good girl and get a radio taxi to the Universal Export
entrance. And put all that junk inside it, would you? I’ll be
down in a minute. I’ll be at the flat all this evening’—he
smiled sourly—‘packing my silk shirts with the crests on
them.’ He got up. ‘So long, Mary. Or rather goodnight,
Goodnight. And keep out of trouble till I get back.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She said, ‘You do that yourself.’ She bent and picked up
the books and papers from the floor and, keeping her face
hidden from Bond, went to the door and kicked it shut
behind her with her heel. A moment or two later she opened
the door again. Her eyes were bright. ‘I’m sorry, James.
Good luck! And Happy Christmas!’ She closed the door
softly behind her.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked at the blank face of the Office of Works cream
door. What a dear girl Mary was! But now there was Tracy.
He would be near her in Switzerland. It was time to make
contact again. He had been missing her, wondering about
her. There had been three non-committal but cheerful postcards
from the Clinique de l’Aube at Davos. Bond had made
inquiries and had ascertained that this was run by a Professor
Auguste Kommer, President of the Société Psychiatrique
et Psychologique Suisse. Over the telephone, Sir
James Molony, the nerve specialist by appointment to the
Service, had told Bond that Kommer was one of the top men
in the world at his job. Bond had written affectionately and
encouragingly to Tracy and had had the letters posted from
America. He had said he would be home soon and would
be in touch with her. Would he? And what would he do then?
Bond had a luxurious moment feeling sorry for himself, for
the miscellaneous burdens he was carrying alone. He then
crushed out his cigarette and, banging doors behind him,
got the hell out of his office and down in the lift to the discreet
side-entrance that said ‘Universal Export’.</p>

<p class="pindent">The taxi was waiting. It was seven o’clock. As the taxi
got under way, Bond made his plan for the evening. He
would first do an extremely careful packing job of his single
suitcase, the one that had no tricks to it, have two double
vodkas and tonics with a dash of Angostura, eat a large dish
of May’s speciality—scrambled eggs fines herbes—have two
more vodkas and tonics, and then, slightly drunk, go to bed
with half a grain of seconal.</p>

<p class="pindent">Encouraged by the prospect of this cosy self-anaesthesia,
Bond brusquely kicked his problems under the carpet of his
consciousness.</p>
