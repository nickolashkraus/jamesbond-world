<p class="line7"><span class="sc"><span class="gesp">(The Bombard</span></span> had now beaten round the dolefully clanging
bell-buoy and was hammering slowly up the River Royale
against the current. The gay lights of the little marina, haven
of cross-channel yachtsmen, showed way up on the right
bank, and it crossed Bond’s mind to wait until they were
slightly above it and then plunge his knife into the side and
bottom of the rubber Bombard and swim for it. But he already
heard in his mind the boom of the guns and heard the
zwip and splash of the bullets round his head until, probably,
there came the bright burst of light and the final flash of
knowledge that he had at last had it. And anyway, how well
could the girl swim, and in this current? Bond was now very
cold. He leant closer against her and went back to remembering
the night before and combing his memories for clues.)</p>

<p class="pindent">After the long walk across the Salle d’Entrée, past the
vitrines of Van Cleef, Lanvin, Hermès and the rest, there
came the brief pause for identification at the long desk backed
by the tiers of filing cabinets, the payment for the Carte
d’Entrée pour les Salles de Jeux, the quick, comptometer
survey of the physiognomiste at the entrance, the bow and
flourish of the garishly uniformed huissier at the door, and
James Bond was inside the belly of the handsome, scented
machine.</p>

<p class="pindent">He paused for a moment by the caisse, his nostrils flaring
at the smell of the crowded, electric, elegant scene, then he
walked slowly across to the top chemin de fer table beside
the entrance to the luxuriously appointed bar, and caught the
eye of Monsieur Pol, the Chef de Jeu of the high game.
Monsieur Pol spoke to a huissier and Bond was shown to
Number Seven, reserved by a counter from the huissier’s
pocket. The huissier gave a quick brush to the baize inside
the line—that famous line that had been the bone of contention
in the Tranby Croft case involving King Edward VII—polished
an ash-tray and pulled out the chair for Bond. Bond
sat down. The shoe was at the other end of the table, at
Number Three. Cheerful and relaxed, Bond examined the
faces of the other players while the Changeur changed his
notes for a hundred thousand into ten blood-red counters of
ten thousand each. Bond stacked them in a neat pile in front
of him and watched the play which, he saw from the notice
hanging between the green-shaded lights over the table, was
for a minimum of one hundred New Francs, or ten thousand
of the old. But, he noted that the game was being opened by
each banker for up to five hundred New Francs—serious
money—say forty pounds as a starter.</p>

<p class="pindent">The players were the usual international mixture—three
Lille textile tycoons in over-padded dinner-jackets, a couple
of heavy women in diamonds who might be Belgian, a rather
Agatha Christie-style little Englishwoman who played
quietly and successfully and might be a villa owner, two
middle-aged Americans in dark suits who appeared cheerful
and slightly drunk, probably down from Paris, and Bond.
Watchers and casual punters were two-deep round the table.
No girl!</p>

<p class="pindent">The game was cold. The shoe went slowly round the table,
each banker in turn going down on that dread third coup
which, for some reason, is the sound barrier at chemin de
fer which must be broken if you are to have a run. Each
time, when it came to Bond’s turn, he debated whether to
bow to the pattern and pass his bank after the second coup.
Each time, for nearly an hour of play, he obstinately told
himself that the pattern would break, and why not with him?
That the cards have no memory and that it was time for them
to run. And each time, as did the other players, he went down
on the third coup. The shoe came to an end. Bond left his
money on the table and wandered off among the other tables,
visiting the roulette, the trente et quarante and the baccarat
table, to see if he could find the girl. When she had passed
him that evening in the Lancia, he had only caught a glimpse
of fair hair and of a pure, rather authoritative profile. But
he knew that he would recognize her at once, if only by the
cord of animal magnetism that had bound them together
during the race. But there was no sign of her.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond went back to the table. The croupier was marshalling
the six packs into the oblong block that would soon be slipped
into the waiting shoe. Since Bond was beside him, the croupier
offered him the neutral, plain red card to cut the pack with.
Bond rubbed the card between his fingers and, with amused
deliberation, slipped it as nearly half-way down the block
of cards as he could estimate. The croupier smiled at him
and at his deliberation, went through the legerdemain that
would in due course bring the red stop card into the tongue
of the shoe and stop the game just seven cards before the
end of the shoe, packed the long block of cards into the shoe,
slid in the metal tongue that held them prisoner and
announced, loud and clear: ‘Messieurs [the ‘mesdames’ are
traditionally not mentioned; since Victorian days it has been
assumed that ladies do not gamble], les jeux sont faits.
Numéro six à la main.’ The Chef de Jeu, on his throne behind
the croupier, took up the cry, the huissiers shepherded
distant stragglers back to their places, and the game began
again.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond confidently bancoed the Lille tycoon on his
left, won, made up the cagnotte with a few small counters,
and doubled the stake to two thousand New Francs—two
hundred thousand of the old.</p>

<p class="pindent">He won that, and the next. Now for the hurdle of the third
coup and he was off to the races! He won it with a natural
nine! Eight hundred thousand in the bank (as Bond reckoned
it)! Again he won, with difficulty this time—his six against
a five. Then he decided to play it safe and pile up some capital.
Of the one million six, he asked for the six hundred to be put
‘en garage’, removed from the stake, leaving a bank of one
million. Again he won. Now he put a million ‘en garage’.
Once more a bank of a million, and now he would have a
fat cushion of one million six coming to him anyway! But
it was getting difficult to make up his stake. The table was
becoming wary of this dark Englishman who played so
quietly, wary of the half-smile of certitude on his rather cruel
mouth. Who was he? Where did he come from? What did
he do? There was a murmur of excited speculation round the
table. So far a run of six. Would the Englishman pocket his
small fortune and pass the bank? Or would he continue to
run it? Surely the cards must change! But James Bond’s
mind was made up. The cards have no memory in defeat.
They also have no memory in victory. He ran the bank three
more times, adding each time a million to his ‘garage’, and
then the little old English lady, who had so far left the running
to the others, stepped in and bancoed him at the tenth
turn, and Bond smiled across at her, knowing that she was
going to win. And she did, ignominiously, with a one against
Bond’s ‘bûche’—three kings, making zero.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a sigh of relief round the table. The spell had
been broken! And a whisper of envy as the heavy, mother-of-pearl
plaques piled nearly a foot high, four million, six
hundred thousand francs’ worth, well over three thousand
pounds, were shunted across to Bond with the flat of the
croupier’s spatula. Bond tossed a plaque for a hundred New
Francs to the croupier, received the traditional ‘Merci, monsieur!
Pour le personnel!’ and the game went on.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond lit a cigarette and paid little attention as the
shoe went shunting round the table away from him. He had
made a packet, dammit! A bloody packet! Now he must be
careful. Sit on it. But not too careful, not sit on all of it! This
was a glorious evening. It was barely past midnight. He
didn’t want to go home yet. So be it! He would run his bank
when it came to him, but do no bancoing of the others—absolutely
none. The cards had got hot. His run had shown
that. There would be other runs now, and he could easily
burn his fingers chasing them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was right. When the shoe got to Number Five, to
one of the Lille tycoons two places to the left of Bond, an
ill-mannered, loud-mouthed player who smoked a cigar out
of an amber-and-gold holder and who tore at the cards with
heavily manicured, spatulate fingers and slapped them down
like a German tarot player, he quickly got through the third
coup and was off. Bond, in accordance with his plan, left
him severely alone and now, at the sixth coup, the bank stood
at twenty thousand New Francs—twenty million of the old,
and the table had got wary again. Everyone was sitting on his
money.</p>

<p class="pindent">The croupier and the Chef de Jeu made their loud calls,
‘Un banco de vingt mille! Faites vos jeux, messieurs. Il reste
à compléter! Un banco de vingt mille!’</p>

<p class="pindent">And then there she was! She had come from nowhere and
was standing beside the croupier, and Bond had no time to
take in more than golden arms, a beautiful golden face with
brilliant blue eyes and shocking pink lips, some kind of a
plain white dress, a bell of golden hair down to her shoulders,
and then it came. ‘Banco!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Everyone looked at her and there was a moment’s silence.
And then ‘Le banco est fait’ from the croupier, and the
monster from Lille (as Bond now saw him) was tearing the
cards out of the shoe, and hers were on their way over to her
on the croupier’s spatula.</p>

<p class="pindent">She bent down and there was a moment of discreet cleavage
in the white V of her neckline.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Une carte.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s heart sank. She certainly hadn’t anything better
than a five. The monster turned his up. Seven. And now he
scrabbled out a card for her and flicked it contemptuously
across. A simpering queen!</p>

<p class="pindent">The croupier delicately faced her other two cards with the
tip of his spatula. A four! She had lost!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond groaned inwardly and looked across to see how she
had taken it.</p>

<p class="pindent">What he saw was not reassuring. The girl was whispering
urgently to the Chef de Jeu. He was shaking his head, sweat
was beading on his cheeks. In the silence that had fallen
round the table, the silence that licks its lips at the strong
smell of scandal, which was now electric in the air, Bond
heard the Chef de Jeu say firmly, ‘Mais c’est ìmpossible. Je
regrette, madame. Il faut vous arranger à la caisse.’</p>

<p class="pindent">And now that most awful of all whispers in a casino was
running among the watchers and the players like a slithering
reptile: ‘Le coup du déshonneur! C’est le coup du déshonneur!
Quelle honte! Quelle honte!’</p>

<p class="pindent">Oh, my God! thought Bond. She’s done it! She hasn’t got
the money! And for some reason she can’t get any credit at
the caisse!</p>

<p class="pindent">The monster from Lille was making the most of the situation.
He knew that the casino would pay in the case of a
default. He sat back with lowered eyes, puffing at his cigar,
the injured party.</p>

<p class="pindent">But Bond knew of the stigma the girl would carry for the
rest of her life. The Casinos of France are a strong trade
union. They have to be. Tomorrow the telegrams would go
out: ‘Madame la Comtesse Teresa di Vicenzo, passport number
X, is to be put on the black list.’ That would be the end
of her casino life in France, in Italy, probably also in Germany,
Egypt and, today, England. It was like being declared
a bad risk at Lloyd’s or with the City security firm of Dun
and Bradstreet. In American gambling circles, she might even
have been liquidated. In Europe, for her, the fate would be
almost as severe. In the circles in which, presumably, she
moved, she would be bad news, unclean. The ‘coup du
déshonneur’ simply wasn’t done. It was social ostracism.</p>

<p class="pindent">Not caring about the social ostracism, thinking only about
the wonderful girl who had outdriven him, shown him her
tail, between Abbeville and Montreuil, James Bond leant
slightly forward. He tossed two of the precious pearly plaques
into the centre of the table. He said, with a slightly bored,
slightly puzzled intonation, ‘Forgive me. Madame has forgotten
that we agreed to play in partnership this evening.’
And, not looking at the girl, but speaking with authority to
the Chef de Jeu, ‘I beg your pardon. My mind was elsewhere.
Let the game continue.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The tension round the table relaxed. Or rather it changed
to another target, away from the girl. Was it true what this
Englishman had said? But it must be! One does not pay
twenty million francs for a girl. But previously there had been
no relationship between them—so far as one could see. They
had been at opposite sides of the table. No signs of complicity
had been exchanged. And the girl? She had shown
no emotion. She had looked at the man, once, with directness.
Then she had quietly moved away from the table, towards the
bar. There was certainly something odd here—something
one did not understand. But the game was proceeding. The
Chef de Jeu had surreptitiously wiped a handkerchief across
his face. The croupier had raised his head, which, previously,
had seemed to be bowed under some kind of emotional guillotine.
And now the old pattern had re-established itself. ‘La
partie continue. Un banco de quarante mille!’</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond glanced down at the still formidable pile of
counters between his curved, relaxed arms. It would be nice
to get that twenty million francs back. It might be hours
before a banco of equal size offered the chance. After all, he
was playing with the casino’s money! His profits represented
‘found’ money and, if he lost, he could still go away with a
small profit—enough and to spare to pay for his night at
Royale. And he had taken a dislike to the monster from Lille.
It would be amusing to reverse the old fable—first to rescue
the girl, then to slay the monster. And it was time for the
man’s run of luck to end. After all, the cards have no memory!</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond had not enough funds to take the whole banco,
only half of it, what is known as ‘avec la table’, meaning that
the other players could make up the remaining half if they
wanted to. Bond, forgetting the conservative strategy he had
sworn himself to only half an hour before, leant slightly
forward and said, ‘Avec la table,’ and pushed twenty thousand
New Francs over the line.</p>

<p class="pindent">Money followed his on to the table. Was this not the Englishman
with the green fingers? And Bond was pleased
to note that the little old Agatha Christie Englishwoman
supported him with ten thousand. That was a good omen!
He looked at the banker, the man from Lille. His cigar had
gone out in its holder and his lips, where they gripped the
holder, were white. He was sweating profusely. He was debating
whether to pass the hand and take his fat profits or
have one more go. The sharp, pig-like eyes darted round the
table, estimating if his four million was covered.</p>

<p class="pindent">The croupier wanted to hurry the play. He said firmly,
‘C’est plus que fait, monsieur.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The man from Lille made up his mind. He gave the shoe
a fat slap, wiped his hand on the baize and forced out a card.
Then one for himself, another for Bond, the fourth for him.
Bond did not reach across Number Six for the cards. He
waited for them to be nudged towards him by the croupier.
He raised them just off the table, slid them far enough apart
between his hands to see the count, edged them together
again and laid them softly face down again on the table. He
had a five! That dubious jade on which one can either draw
or not! The chances of improving your hand towards or away
from a nine are equal. He said ‘Non,’ quietly, and looked
across at the two anonymous pink backs of the cards in front
of the banker. The man tore them up, disgustedly tossed
them out on to the table. Two knaves. A ‘bûche’! Zero!</p>

<p class="pindent">Now there were only four cards that could beat Bond and
only one, the five, that could equal him. Bond’s heart
thumped. The man scrabbled at the shoe, snatched out the
card, faced it. A nine, the nine of diamonds! The curse of
Scotland! The best!</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a mere formality to turn over and reveal Bond’s
miserable five. But there was a groan round the table. ‘Il
fallait tirer,’ said someone. But if he had, Bond would have
drawn the nine and disimproved down to a four. It all depended
on what the next card, its pink tongue now hiding its
secret in the mouth of the shoe, might have been. Bond
didn’t wait to see. He smiled a thin, rueful smile round the
table to apologize to his fellow losers, shovelled the rest of
his chips into his coat pocket, tipped the huissier who had
been so busy emptying his ash-tray over the hours of play,
and slipped away from the table towards the bar, while the
croupier triumphantly announced, ‘Un banco de
quatre-vingt mille francs! Faites vos jeux, messieurs! Un banco de
quatre-vingt mille Nouveaux Francs.’ To hell with it! thought
Bond. Half an hour before he had had a small fortune in his
pocket. Now, through a mixture of romantic quixotry and
sheer folly he had lost it all. Well, he shrugged, he had asked
for a night to remember. That was the first half of it. What
would be the second?</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl was sitting by herself, with half a bottle of Bollinger
in front of her, staring moodily at nothing. She barely
looked up when Bond slipped into the chair next to hers and
said, ‘Well, I’m afraid our syndicate lost again. I tried to get
it back. I went “avec”. I should have left that brute alone.
I stood on a five and he had a “bûche” and then drew a
nine.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She said dully, ‘You should have drawn on the five. I
always do.’ She reflected. ‘But then you would have had a
four. What was the next card?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I didn’t wait to see. I came to look for you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She gave him a sideways, appraising glance. ‘Why did you
rescue me when I made the “coup du déshonneur”?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shrugged. ‘Beautiful girl in distress. Besides, we
made friends between Abbeville and Montreuil this evening.
You drive like an angel.’ He smiled. ‘But I don’t think you’d
have passed me if I’d been paying attention. I was doing
about ninety and not bothering to keep an eye on the mirror.
And I was thinking of other things.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The gambit succeeded. Vivacity came into her face and
voice. ‘Oh, yes. I’d have beaten you anyway. I’d have passed
you in the villages. Besides’—there was an edge of bitterness
in her voice—‘I would always be able to beat you. You want
to stay alive.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Oh, lord! thought Bond. One of those! A girl with a wing,
perhaps two wings, down. He chose to let the remark lie.
The half-bottle of Krug he had ordered came. After the
huissier had half filled the glass, Bond topped it to the brim.
He held it towards her without exaggeration. ‘My name is
Bond, James Bond. Please stay alive, at any rate for tonight.’
He drank the glass down at one long gulp and filled it again.</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked at him gravely, considering him. Then she also
drank. She said, ‘My name is Tracy. That is short for all the
names you were told at the reception in the hotel. Teresa was
a saint. I am not a saint. The manager is perhaps a romantic.
He told me of your inquiries. So shall we go now? I am not
interested in conversation. And you have earned your reward.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She rose abruptly. So did Bond, confused. ‘No. I will go
alone. You can come later. The number is 45. There, if you
wish, you can make the most expensive piece of love of your
life. It will have cost you forty million francs. I hope it will
be worth it.’</p>
