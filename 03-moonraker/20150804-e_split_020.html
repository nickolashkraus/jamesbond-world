<p class="pindent">The Mercedes was a beautiful thing. Bond pulled his
battered grey Bentley up alongside it and inspected it.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a Type 300 S, the sports model with a disappearing
hood—one of only half a dozen in England, he reflected.
Left-hand drive. Probably bought in Germany. He had seen
a few of them over there. One had hissed by him on the
Munich Autobahn the year before when he was doing a solid
ninety in the Bentley. The body, too short and heavy to be
graceful, was painted white, with red leather upholstery.
Garish for England, but Bond guessed that Drax had chosen
white in honour of the famous Mercedes-Benz racing colours
that had already swept the board again since the war at Le
Mans and the Nurburgring.</p>

<p class="pindent">Typical of Drax to buy a Mercedes. There was something
ruthless and majestic about the cars, he decided, remembering
the years from 1934 to 1939 when they had completely
dominated the Grand Prix scene, children of the famous
Blitzen Benz that had captured the world’s speed record at
142 m.p.h. back in 1911. Bond recalled some of their famous
drivers, Caracciola, Lang, Seaman, Brauschitz, and the days
when he had seen them drifting the fast sweeping bends of
Tripoli at 190, or screaming along the tree-lined straight at
Berne with the Auto Unions on their tails.</p>

<p class="pindent">And yet, Bond looked across at his supercharged Bentley,
nearly twenty-five years older than Drax’s car and still capable
of beating 100, and yet when Bentleys were racing, before
Rolls had tamed them into sedate town carriages, they
had whipped the blown SS-K’s almost as they wished.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had once dabbled on the fringe of the racing world
and he was lost in his memories, hearing again the harsh
scream of Caracciola’s great white beast of a car as it howled
past the grandstands at Le Mans, when Drax came out of the
house followed by Gala Brand and Krebs.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Fast car,” said Drax, pleased with Bond’s look of admiration.
He gestured towards the Bentley. “They used to be
good in the old days,” he added with a touch of patronage.
“Now they’re only built for going to the theatre. Too well-mannered.
Even the Continental. Now then you, get in the
back.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Krebs obediently climbed into the narrow back seat behind
the driver. He sat sideways, his mackintosh up round
his ears, his eyes fixed enigmatically on Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala Brand, smart in a dark grey tailor-made and black
beret and carrying a lightweight black raincoat and gloves,
climbed into the right half of the divided front seat. The wide
door closed with the rich double click of a Fabergé box.</p>

<p class="pindent">No sign passed between Bond and Gala. They had made
their plans at a whispered meeting in his room before lunch—dinner
in London at half-past seven and then back to the
house in Bond’s car. She sat demurely, her hands in her lap
and her eyes to the front, as Drax climbed in, pressed the
starter, and pulled the gleaming lever on the steering wheel
back into third. The car surged away with hardly a purr
from the exhaust and Bond watched it disappear into the
trees before he climbed into the Bentley and moved off in
leisurely pursuit.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the hastening Mercedes, Gala busied herself with her
thoughts. The night had been uneventful and the morning
had been devoted to clearing the launching site of everything
that might possibly burn when the Moonraker was
fired. Drax had not referred to the events of the previous day
and there had been no change in his usual manner. She had
prepared her last firing plan (Drax himself was to do it on
the morrow) and as usual Walter had been sent for and
through her spy-hole she had seen the figures being entered
in Drax’s black book.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a hot, sunny day and Drax was driving in his shirt-sleeves.
She glanced down and to the left at the top of the
little book protruding from his hip-pocket. This drive might
be her last chance. Since the evening before she had felt a
different person. Perhaps Bond had aroused her competitive
spirit, perhaps it was revulsion from playing the secretary
too long, perhaps it was the shock of the cliff-fall and the zest
of realizing after so many quiet months that she was playing
a dangerous game. But now she felt the time had come to take
risks. Discovery of the Moonraker’s flight-plan was a routine
affair and it would give her personal satisfaction to find out
the secret of the black notebook. It would be easy.</p>

<p class="pindent">Casually she laid her folded coat over the space between
herself and Drax. At the same time she made a show of
arranging herself comfortably, during the course of which she
drew an inch or two nearer Drax and her hand came to rest
in the folds of the coat between them. Then she settled herself
to wait.</p>

<p class="pindent">Her chance came, as she had thought it might, in the congested
traffic of Maidstone. Drax, intent, was trying to beat
the traffic lights at the corner of King Street and Gabriel’s
Hill, but the line of traffic was too slow and he was checked
behind a battered family saloon. Gala could see that when
the lights changed he was determined to cut in front of the
car in front and teach it a lesson. He was a brilliant driver,
but a vindictive and impatient one who was always anxious
for any car that held him up to be given something to remember.</p>

<p class="pindent">As the lights went green he gave a blast on his triple horns,
pulled out to the right at the intersection, accelerated brutally
and got by, shaking his head angrily at the driver of the
saloon as he passed it.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the middle of this harsh manoeuvre it was natural for
Gala to allow herself to be thrown towards him. At the same
time her left hand dived under the coat and her fingers
touched, felt, and extracted the book in one flow of motion.
Then the hand was back in the folds of the coat again and
Drax, all his feeling in his feet and hands, was seeing nothing
but the traffic ahead and the chances of getting across the
zebra outside the Royal Star without hitting two women and
a boy who were nearly halfway across it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now it was a question of facing Drax’s growl of rage as
with a maidenly but urgent voice she asked if she could
possibly stop for a moment to powder her nose.</p>

<p class="pindent">A garage would be dangerous. He might decide to fill up
with petrol. And perhaps he also carried his money in his
hip-pocket. But was there an hotel? Yes, she remembered,
the Thomas Wyatt just outside Maidstone. And it had no
petrol pumps. She started to fidget slightly. She pulled the
coat back on to her lap. She cleared her throat.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, excuse me, Sir Hugo,” she said in a strangled voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes. What is it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m terribly sorry, Sir Hugo. But could you possibly stop
for just a moment. I want, I mean, I’m terribly sorry but I’d
like to powder my nose. It’s terribly stupid of me. I’m so
sorry.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Christ,” said Drax. “Why the hell didn’t you . . . Oh, yes.
Well, all right. Find a place.” He grumbled on into his
moustache, but brought the big car down into the fifties.</p>

<p class="pindent">“There’s a hotel just around this bend,” said Gala nervously.
“Thank you so much, Sir Hugo. It was stupid of me. I
won’t be a moment. Yes, here it is.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The car swerved up to the front of the inn and stopped
with a jerk. “Hurry up. Hurry up,” said Drax as Gala, leaving
the door of the car open, sped obediently across the
gravel, her coat with its precious secret held tightly in front
of her body.</p>

<p class="pindent">She locked the door of the lavatory and snatched open the
notebook.</p>

<p class="pindent">There they were, just as she had thought. On each page,
under the date, the neat columns of figures, the atmospheric
pressure, the wind velocity, the temperature, just as she had
recorded them from the Air Ministry figures. And at the foot
of each page the estimated settings for the gyro compasses.</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala frowned. At a glance she could see that they were
entirely different from hers. Drax’s figures simply bore no
relation to hers whatsoever.</p>

<p class="pindent">She turned to the last completed page containing the
figures for that day. Why, she was wrong by nearly ninety
degrees on the estimated course. If the rocket were fired on
her flight plan it would land somewhere in France. She looked
wildly at her face in the mirror over the washbasin. How
could she have gone so monstrously wrong? And why hadn’t
Drax ever told her? Why, she ran quickly through the book
again, every day she had been ninety degrees out, firing the
Moonraker at right angles to its true course. And yet she
simply couldn’t have made such a mistake. Did the Ministry
know these secret figures? And why should they be secret?</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly her bewilderment turned to fright. She must
somehow get safely, quietly to London and tell somebody.
Even though she might be called a fool and a meddler.</p>

<p class="pindent">Coldly she turned back several pages in the book, took her
nail file out of the bag and, as neatly as she could, cut out a
specimen page, rolled it up into a tight ball and stuffed it into
the tip of a finger of one of her gloves.</p>

<p class="pindent">She glanced at her face in the mirror. It was pale and she
quickly rubbed her cheeks to bring back the colour. Then she
put back the look of an apologetic secretary and hurried out
and ran across the gravel to the car, clutching the notebook
among the folds of her coat.</p>

<p class="pindent">The engine of the Mercedes was turning over. Drax
glowered at her impatiently as she scrambled back into her
seat.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Come on. Come on,” he said, putting the car into third
and taking his foot off the clutch so that she nearly caught
her ankle in the heavy door. The tyres churned up the gravel
as he accelerated out of the parking place and dry-skidded
into the London road.</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala was jerked back, but she remembered to let the coat
with her guilty hand in its folds fall on the seat between her
and the driver.</p>

<p class="pindent">And now the book back into the hip-pocket.</p>

<p class="pindent">She watched the speedometer hovering in the seventies as
Drax flung the heavy car along the crown of the road.</p>

<p class="pindent">She tried to remember her lessons. Distracting pressure
on some other part of the body. Distracting the attention.
Distraction. The victim must not be at ease. His senses must
be focused away. He must be unaware of the touch on his
body. Anaesthetized by a stronger stimulus.</p>

<p class="pindent">Like now, for instance. Drax, bent forward over the wheel,
was fighting for a chance to get past a sixty-foot RAF trailer,
but the oncoming traffic was leaving no room on the crown
of the road. There was a gap and Drax rammed the lever
into second and took it, his horns braying imperiously.</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala’s hand reached to the left under the coat.</p>

<p class="pindent">But another hand struck like a snake.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Got you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Krebs was leaning half over the back of the driving seat.
His hand was crushing hers into the slippery cover of the
notebook under the folds of the coat.</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala sat frozen into black ice. With all her strength she
wrenched at her hand. It was no good. Krebs had all his
weight on it now.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax had got past the trailer and the road was empty.
Krebs said urgently in German, “Please stop the car, <span class="it">mein
Kapitän</span>. Miss Brand is a spy.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax gave a startled glance to his right. What he saw was
enough. He put his hand quickly down to his hip-pocket, and
then, slowly, deliberately, put it back on the wheel. The sharp
turning to Mereworth was just coming up on his left. “Hold
her,” said Drax. He braked so that the tyres screamed,
changed down and wrenched the car into the side-road. A
few hundred yards down it he pulled the car into the side and
stopped.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax looked up and down the road. It was empty. He
reached over one gloved hand and wrenched Gala’s face towards
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">“What is this?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I can explain it, Sir Hugo.” Gala tried to bluff against
the horror and desperation she knew was in her face. “It’s a
mistake. I didn’t mean . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">Under cover of an angry shrug of the shoulders, her right
hand moved softly behind her and the guilty pair of gloves
were thrust behind the leather cushion.</p>

<p class="pindent">“<span class="it">Sehen sie her, mein Kapitän.</span> I saw her edging up close to
you. It seemed to me strange.”</p>

<p class="pindent">With his other hand Krebs had whipped the coat away
and there were the bent white fingers of her left hand crushed
into the cover of the notebook still a foot away from Drax’s
hip-pocket.</p>

<p class="pindent">“So.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The word was deadly cold and with a shivering finality.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax let go her chin, but her horrified eyes remained
locked into his.</p>

<p class="pindent">A kind of frozen cruelty was showing through the jolly
façade of red skin and whiskers. It was a different man. The
man behind the mask. The creature beneath the flat stone
that Gala Brand had lifted.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax glanced again up and down the empty road.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then, looking carefully into the suddenly aware blue eyes,
he drew the leather driving gauntlet off his left hand and
with his right whipped her as hard as he could across the face
with it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Only a short cry was forced out of Gala’s constricted
throat, but tears of pain ran down her cheeks. Suddenly she
began to fight like a mad woman.</p>

<p class="pindent">With all her strength she heaved and fought against the
two iron arms that held her. With her free right hand she
tried to reach the face that leant over her hand and get at the
eyes. But Krebs easily moved his head out of her reach
and quietly increased the pressure across her throat, hissing
murderously to himself as her nails tore strips of skin off the
backs of his hands, but noting with a scientist’s eye as her
struggles became weaker.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax watched carefully, with one eye on the road, as Krebs
brought her under control and then he started the car and
drove cautiously on along the wooded road. He grunted with
satisfaction as he came upon a cart-track into the woods and
he turned up it and only stopped when he was well out of
sight of the road.</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala had just realized that there were no noise from the
engine when she heard Drax say ‘there’. A finger touched
her skull behind the left ear. Krebs arm came away from
her throat and she slumped gratefully forward, gasping for
air. Then something crashed into the back of her head where
the finger had touched it, and there was a flash of wonderfully
releasing pain and blackness.</p>

<p class="pindent">An hour later passers-by saw a white Mercedes draw up
outside a small house at the Buckingham Palace end of
Ebury Street and two kind gentlemen help a sick girl out and
through the front door. Those who were near could see that
the poor girl’s face was very pale and that her eyes were shut
and that the kind gentlemen almost had to carry her up the
steps. The big gentleman with the red face and whiskers was
heard to say quite distinctly to the other man that poor
Mildred had promised she wouldn’t go out until she was
quite well again. Very sad.</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala came to herself in a large top-floor room that seemed
to be full of machinery. She was tied very securely to a chair
and apart from the searing pain in her head she could feel
that her lips and cheek were bruised and swollen.</p>

<p class="pindent">Heavy curtains were drawn across the window and there
was a musty smell in the room as if it was rarely used. There
was dust on the few pieces of conventional furniture and only
the chromium and ebonite dials on the machines looked clean
and new. She thought that she was probably in hospital. She
closed her eyes and wondered. It was not long before she
remembered. She spent several minutes controlling herself
and then she opened her eyes again.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax, his back to her, was watching the dials on a machine
that looked like a very large radio set. There were three more
similar machines in her line of sight and from one of them
a thin steel aerial reached up to a rough hole that had been
cut for it in the plaster of the ceiling. The room was brightly
lit by several tall standard lamps, each of which held a naked
high wattage bulb.</p>

<p class="pindent">To her left there was a noise of tinkering and by swivelling
her half-closed eyes in their sockets, which made the pain in
her head much worse, she saw the figure of Krebs bent over
an electric generator on the floor. Beside it there was a small
petrol engine and it was this that was giving trouble. Every
now and then Krebs would grasp the starting-handle and
crank it hard and a feeble stutter would come from the
engine before he went back to his tinkering.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You dam’ fool,” said Drax in German, “hurry up. I’ve
got to go and see those bloody oafs at the Ministry.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“At once, <span class="it">mein Kapitän</span>,” said Krebs dutifully. He seized
the handle again. This time after two or three coughs the
engine started up and began to purr.</p>

<p class="pindent">“It won’t make too much noise?” asked Drax.</p>

<p class="pindent">“No, <span class="it">mein Kapitän</span>. The room has been soundproofed,”
answered Krebs. “Dr Walter assures me that nothing will be
heard outside.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala closed her eyes and decided that her only hope was
to feign unconscious for as long as possible. Did they intend
to kill her? Here in this room? And what was all this machinery?
It looked like wireless, or perhaps radar. That curved
glass screen above Drax’s head that had given an occasional
flicker as Drax fiddled with the knobs below the dials.</p>

<p class="pindent">Slowly her mind started to work again. Why, for instance,
was Drax suddenly talking perfect German? And why did
Krebs address him as <span class="it">Herr Kapitän</span>? And the figures in the
black book. Why did they nearly kill her because she had seen
them? What did they mean?</p>

<p class="pindent">Ninety degrees, ninety degrees.</p>

<p class="pindent">Lazily her mind turned the problem over.</p>

<p class="pindent">Ninety degrees difference. Supposing her figures had been
right all the time for the target eighty miles away in the
North Sea. Just supposing she had been right. Then she
wouldn’t have been aiming the rocket into the middle of
France after all. But Drax’s figures. Ninety degrees to the left
of her North Sea target? Somewhere in England presumably.
Eighty miles from Dover. Yes, of course. That was it.
Drax’s figures. The firing plan in the little black book. They
would drop the Moonraker just about in the middle of
London.</p>

<p class="pindent">But on London! On London!!</p>

<p class="pindent">So one’s heart really does go into one’s throat. How extraordinary.
Such a commonplace and yet there it is and it
really does almost stop one breathing.</p>

<p class="pindent">And now, let me see, so this is a radar homing device. How
ingenious. The same as there would be on the raft in the
North Sea. This would bring the rocket down within a hundred
yards of Buckingham Palace. But would that matter
with a warhead full of instruments?</p>

<p class="pindent">It was probably the cruelty of Drax’s blow across her face
that settled it, but suddenly she <span class="it">knew</span> that somehow it would
be a real warhead, an atomic warhead, and that Drax was an
enemy of England and that tomorrow at noon he was going to
destroy London.</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala made a last effort to understand.</p>

<p class="pindent">Through this ceiling, through this chair, into the ground.
The thin needle of the rocket. Dropping fast as light out of
a clear sky. The crowds in the streets. The Palace. The nurse-maids
in the park. The birds in the trees. The great bloom of
flame a mile wide. And then the mushroom cloud. And
nothing left. Nothing. Nothing. Nothing.</p>

<p class="pindent">“No. Oh, <span class="it">no</span>!”</p>

<p class="pindent">But the scream was only in her mind and Gala, her body
a twisted black potato crisp amongst a million others, had
already fainted.</p>
