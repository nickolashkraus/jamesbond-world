<p class="pindent">Through half-closed eyes Bond looked intently at the
torch while for a few precious seconds he sat and let life
creep back into his body. His head felt as if it had been used
as a football, but there was nothing broken. Drax had hit him
unscientifically and with the welter of blows of a drunken
man.</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala watched him anxiously. The eyes in the bloody face
were almost shut, but the line of the jaw was taut with concentration
and she could feel the effort of will he was making.</p>

<p class="pindent">He gave his head a shake and when he turned towards her
she could see that his eyes were feverish with triumph.</p>

<p class="pindent">He nodded towards the desk. “The lighter,” he said
urgently. “I had to try and make him forget it. Follow me.
I’ll show you.” He started to rock the light steel chair inch by
inch towards the desk. “For God’s sake don’t tip over or
we’ve had it. But make it fast or the blowlamp’ll get cold.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Uncomprehendingly, and feeling almost as if they were
playing some ghastly children’s game, Gala carefully rocked
her way across the floor in his wake.</p>

<p class="pindent">Seconds later Bond told her to stop beside the desk while he
went rocking on round to Drax’s chair. Then he manœuvred
himself into position opposite his target and with a sudden
lurch heaved himself and the chair forward so that his head
came down.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a painful crack as the Ronson desk lighter connected
with his teeth, but his lips held it and the top of it was
in his mouth as he heaved the chair back with just enough
force to prevent it spilling over. Then he started his patient
journey back to where Gala was sitting at the corner of the
desk on which Krebs had left the blowlamp.</p>

<p class="pindent">He rested until his breath was steady again. “Now we come
to the difficult part,” he said grimly. “While I try to get this
torch going, you get your chair round so that your right arm
is as close in front of me as possible.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Obediently she edged herself round while Bond swayed his
chair so that it leant against the edge of the desk and allowed
his mouth to reach forward and grip the handle of the blowtorch
between his teeth.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he eased the torch towards him and after minutes
of patient work he had the torch and the lighter arranged to
his liking at the edge of the desk.</p>

<p class="pindent">After another rest he bent down, closed the valve of the
torch with his teeth, and proceeded to get pressure back by
slowly and repeatedly pulling up the plunger with his lips
and pressing it back with his chin. His face could feel the
warmth in the pre-heater and he could smell the remnants
of gas in it. If only it hadn’t cooled off too much.</p>

<p class="pindent">He straightened up.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Last lap, Gala,” he said, smiling crookedly at her. “I may
have to hurt you a bit. All right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course,” said Gala.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Then here goes,” said Bond, and he bent forward and
released the safety valve on the left of the canister.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he quickly bent forward over the Ronson, which
was standing at right angles and just below the neck of the
torch, and with his two front teeth pressed down sharply on
the ignition lever.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a horrible manœuvre and though he whipped back
his head with the speed of a snake he let out a gasp of pain
as the jet of blue fire from the torch seared across his bruised
cheek and the bridge of his nose.</p>

<p class="pindent">But the vaporized paraffin was hissing out its vital tongue
of flame and he shook the water out of his streaming eyes
and bent his head almost at right angles and again got his
teeth to the handle of the blowtorch.</p>

<p class="pindent">He thought his jaw would break with the weight of the
thing and the nerves of his front teeth screamed at him, but
he swayed his chair carefully upright away from the desk
and then strained his bent neck forward until the tip of blue
fire from the torch was biting into the flex that bound Gala’s
right wrist to the arm of her chair.</p>

<p class="pindent">He tried desperately to keep the flame steady but the
breath rasped through the girl’s teeth as the handle shifted
between his jaws and the flame of the torch brushed her
forearm.</p>

<p class="pindent">But then it was over. Melted by the fierce heat, the copper
strands parted one by one and suddenly Gala’s right arm
was free and she was reaching to take the torch out of Bond’s
mouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s head fell back on to his shoulders and he twisted
his neck luxuriously to get the blood moving in the aching
muscles.</p>

<p class="pindent">Almost before he knew it, Gala was bending over his arms
and legs and he too was free.</p>

<p class="pindent">As he sat still for a moment, his eyes closed, waiting for the
life to come back into his body, he suddenly, delightedly felt
Gala’s soft lips on his mouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">He opened his eyes. She was standing in front of him, her
eyes shining. “That’s for what you did,” she said seriously.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You’re a wonderful girl,” he said simply.</p>

<p class="pindent">But then, knowing what he was going to have to do, knowing
that while she might conceivably survive, he had only
another few minutes to live, he closed his eyes so that she
should not see the hopelessness in them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala saw the expression on his face and she turned away.
She thought it was only exhaustion and the culminative effect
of what his body had suffered, and she suddenly remembered
the peroxide in the washroom next to her office.</p>

<p class="pindent">She went through the communicating door. How extraordinary
it was to see her familiar things again. It must be
someone else who had sat at that desk and typed letters and
powdered her nose. She shrugged her shoulders and went
into the little washroom. God what a sight and God how tired
she felt! But first she took a wet towel and some peroxide and
went back and spent ten minutes attending to the battlefield
which was Bond’s face.</p>

<p class="pindent">He sat silent, a hand resting on her waist, and watched her
gratefully. Then when she had gone back into her room and
he heard her shut the door of the washroom behind her he got
up, turned off the still hissing blowtorch, and walked into
Drax’s shower, stripped and stood for five minutes under the
icy water. ‘Preparing the corpse!’ he reflected ruefully as he
surveyed his battered face in the mirror.</p>

<p class="pindent">He put on his clothes and went back to Drax’s desk which
he searched methodically. It yielded only one prize, the
‘office bottle’, a half-full bottle of Haig and Haig. He fetched
two glasses and some water and called to Gala.</p>

<p class="pindent">He heard the door of the washroom open. “What is it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Whisky.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You drink. I’ll be ready in a minute.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked at the bottle and poured himself three-quarters
of a toothglass and drank it straight down in two
gulps. Then he gingerly lit a blessed cigarette and sat on the
edge of the desk and felt the liquor burn down through his
stomach into his legs.</p>

<p class="pindent">He picked up the bottle again and looked at it. Plenty for
Gala and a whole full glass for himself before he walked out
through the door. Better than nothing. It wouldn’t be too
bad with that inside him so long as he walked quickly out
and shut the doors behind him. No looking back.</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala came in, a transformed Gala, looking as beautiful as
the night he had first seen her, except for the lines of exhaustion
under the eyes that the powder could not quite
conceal and the angry welts at her wrists and ankles.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gave her a drink and took another one himself and
their eyes smiled at each other over the rims of their glasses.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then Bond stood up.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Listen, Gala,” he said in a matter-of-fact voice. “We’ve
got to face it and get it over so I’ll make it short and then
we’ll have another drink.” He heard her catch her breath,
but he went on. “In ten minutes or so I’m going to shut you
into Drax’s bathroom and put you under the shower and
turn it full on.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“James,” she cried. She stepped close to him. “Don’t go
on. I know you’re going to say something dreadful. Please
stop, James.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Come on, Gala,” said Bond roughly. “What the hell does
it matter. It’s a bloody miracle we’ve got the chance.” He
moved away from her. He walked to the doors leading out
into the shaft.</p>

<p class="pindent">“And then,” he said, and he held up the precious lighter
in his right hand, “I shall walk out of here and shut the doors
and go and light a last cigarette under the tail of the Moonraker.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“God,” she whispered. “What are you saying? You’re
mad.” She looked at him through eyes wide with horror.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’t be ridiculous,” said Bond impatiently. “What the
hell is there else to do? The explosion will be so terrific that
one won’t feel anything. And it’s bound to work with all that
fuel vapour hanging around. It’s me or a million people in
London. The warhead won’t go off. Atom bombs don’t explode
like that. It’ll be melted probably. There’s just a chance
you may get away. Most of the explosion will take the line of
least resistance through the roof—and down the exhaust pit,
if I can work the machinery that opens up the floor.” He
smiled. “Cheer up,” he said, walking over to her and taking
one of her hands. “The boy stood on the burning deck. I’ve
wanted to copy him since I was five.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala pulled her hand away. “I don’t care what you say,”
she said angrily. “We’ve got to think of something else. You
don’t trust me to have any ideas. You just tell me what you
think we’ve got to do.” She walked over to the wall map and
pressed down the switch. “Of course if we have to use the
lighter we have to.” She gazed at the map of the false flight
plan, barely seeing it. “But the idea of you walking in there
alone and standing in the middle of all those ghastly fumes
from the fuel and calmly flicking that thing and then being
blown to dust . . . And anyway, if we have to do it, we’ll do it
together. I’d rather that than be burnt to death in here. And
anyway,” she paused, “I’d like to go with you. We’re in this
together.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s eyes were tender as he walked towards her and put
an arm round her waist and hugged her to him. “Gala, you’re
a darling,” he said simply. “And if there’s any other way we’ll
take it. But,” he looked at his watch, “it’s past midnight and
we’ve to decide quickly. At any moment it may occur to Drax
to send guards down to see that we’re all right, and God
knows what time he’ll be coming down to set the gyros.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala twisted her body round like a cat. She gazed at him
with her mouth open, her face taut with excitement. “The
gyros,” she whispered, “to set the gyros.” She leant weakly
back again the wall, her eyes searching Bond’s face. “Don’t
you <span class="it">see</span>?” her voice was on the edge of hysteria. “After he’s
gone, we could alter the gyros back, back to the old flight
plan, then the rocket will simply fall into the North Sea
where it’s supposed to go.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She stepped away from the wall and seized his shirt in both
hands and looked imploringly at him. “Can’t we?” she said.
“Can’t we?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Do you know the other settings?” asked Bond sharply.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course I do,” she said urgently. “I’ve been living with
them for a year. We won’t have a weather report but we’ll
just have to chance that. The forecast this morning said we
would have the same conditions as today.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“By God,” said Bond. “We might do it. If only we can
hide somewhere and make Drax think we’ve escaped. What
about the exhaust pit? If I can work the machine to open the
floor.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It’s a straight hundred-foot drop,” said Gala, shaking her
head. “And the walls are polished steel. Just like glass.
And there’s no rope or anything down here. They cleared
everything out of the workshop yesterday. And anyway there
are guards on the beach.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond reflected. Then his eyes brightened. “I’ve got an
idea,” he said. “But first of all what about the radar, the
homing device in London? Won’t that pull the rocket off its
course and back on to London?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala shook her head. “It’s only got a range of about a
hundred miles,” she said. “The rocket won’t even pick up its
signal. If it’s aimed into the North Sea it will get into the orbit
of the transmitter on the raft. There’s absolutely nothing
wrong with my plans. But where can we hide?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“One of the ventilator shafts,” said Bond. “Come on.”</p>

<p class="pindent">He gave a last look round the room. The lighter was in
his pocket. That would still be the last resort. There was
nothing else they would want. He followed Gala out into the
gleaming shaft and made for the instrument panel which
controlled the steel cover to the exhaust pit.</p>

<p class="pindent">After a quick examination he threw over a heavy lever
from ‘<span class="it">Zu</span>’ to ‘<span class="it">Auf</span>’. There was a soft hiss from the hydraulic
machinery behind the wall and the two semi-circles of steel
opened beneath the tail of the rocket and slid back into their
grooves. He walked over and looked down.</p>

<p class="pindent">The arcs in the roof above glinted back at him from the
polished walls of the wide steel funnel until they curved
away out of sight towards the distant hollow boom of the sea.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond went back into Drax’s office and pulled down the
shower curtain in the bathroom. Then Gala and he tore it
into strips and tied them together. He made a jagged rent at
the end of the last strip so as to give an impression that the
escape rope had broken. Then he tied the other end firmly
round the pointed tip of one of the Moonraker’s three fins
and dropped the rest so that it hung down the shaft.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was not much of a false scent, but it might gain some
time.</p>

<p class="pindent">The big round mouths of the ventilator shafts were spaced
about ten yards apart and about four feet off the floor. Bond
counted. There were fifty of them. He carefully opened the
hinged grating that covered one of them and looked up.
Forty feet away there was a faint glimmer from the moonlight
outside. He decided that they were tunnelled straight up
inside the wall of the site until they turned at right angles
towards the gratings in the outside walls.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond reached up and ran his hand along the surface. It
was unfinished roughcast concrete and he grunted with satisfaction
as he felt first one sharp protuberance and then
another. They were the jagged ends of the steel rods reinforcing
the walls, cut off where the shafts had been bored.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was going to be a painful business, but there was no
doubt they could inch their way up one of these shafts, like
mountaineers up a rock chimney, and, in the turn at the top,
lie hidden from anything but the sort of painstaking search
that would be difficult in the morning with all the officials
from London round the site.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond knelt down and the girl climbed on to his back and
started up.</p>

<p class="pindent">An hour later, their feet and shoulders bruised and cut,
they lay exhausted, squeezed tight in each other’s arms, their
heads inches away from the circular grating directly above
the outside door, and listened to the guards restlessly shifting
their feet in the darkness a hundred yards away.</p>

<p class="pindent">Five o’clock, six, seven.</p>

<p class="pindent">Slowly the sun came up behind the dome and the seagulls
started to call in the cliffs and then suddenly there were the
three figures walking towards them in the distance, passed
by a fresh platoon of guards doubling, chins up, knees up, to
relieve the night watch.</p>

<p class="pindent">The figures came nearer and the squinting, exhausted eyes
of the hidden couple could see every detail of Drax’s blood-orange
face, the lean, pale foxiness of Dr Walter, the suety,
overslept puffiness of Krebs.</p>

<p class="pindent">The three men walked like executioners, saying nothing.
Drax took out his key and they silently filed through the door
a few feet below the taut bodies of Bond and Gala.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then for ten minutes there was silence except for the
occasional boom of voices up the ventilator shaft as the three
men moved about down on the steel floor round the exhaust
pit. Bond smiled to himself at the thought of the rage and
consternation on Drax’s face; the miserable Krebs wilting
under the lash of Drax’s tongue; the bitter accusation in
Walter’s eyes. Then the door burst open beneath him and
Krebs was calling urgently to the leader of the guards. A man
detached himself from the semi-circle and ran up.</p>

<p class="pindent">“<span class="it">Die Engländer</span>,” Krebs’s voice was almost hysterical.
“Escaped. The <span class="it">Herr Kapitän</span> thinks they may be in one of
the ventilator shafts. We are going to take a chance. The
dome will be opened again and we will clear out the fumes
from the fuel. And then the <span class="it">Herr Doktor</span> will put the steam
hose up each shaft. If they’re there it will finish them. Choose
four men. The rubber gloves and firesuits are down there.
We’ll take the pressure off the heating. Tell the others to
listen for the screams. <span class="it">Verstanden?</span>”</p>

<p class="pindent">“<span class="it">Zu Befehl!</span>” The man doubled smartly back to his troop
and Krebs, the sweat of anxiety on his face, turned and disappeared
back through the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">For a moment Bond lay motionless.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a heavy rumble above their heads as the dome
divided and swung open.</p>

<p class="pindent">The steam hose!</p>

<p class="pindent">He had heard of mutinies in ships being fought with it.
Rioters in factories. Would it reach forty feet? Would the
pressure last? How many boilers fed the heating? Among
the fifty ventilator shafts, where would they choose to begin?
Had Bond or Gala left any clue to the one they had climbed?</p>

<p class="pindent">He felt that Gala was waiting for him to explain. To do
something. To protect them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Five men came doubling from the semi-circle of guards.
They passed underneath and disappeared.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond put his mouth to Gala’s ear. “This may hurt,” he
said. “Can’t say how much. Can’t be helped. Just have to
take it. No noise.” He felt the answering tentative pressure
from her arms. “Bring your knees up. Don’t be shy. This is no
time to be maidenly.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Shut up,” whispered Gala angrily. He felt one knee creep
up until it was locked between his thighs. His own knee
followed suit until it would go no further. She squirmed
furiously. “Don’t be a bloody fool,” whispered Bond, pulling
her head in close to his chest so that it was half covered by his
open shirt.</p>

<p class="pindent">He overlay her as much as possible. There was nothing
to be done about their ankles or his hands. He pulled his shirt
collar up as far over their heads as possible. They held tightly
to each other.</p>

<p class="pindent">Hot, cramped, breathless. Waiting, it suddenly occurred
to Bond, like two lovers in the undergrowth. Waiting for the
footsteps to go by so that they could start again. He smiled
grimly to himself and listened.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was silence down the shaft. They must be in the
engine room. Walter would be watching the hose being
coupled to the outlet valve. Now there were distant noises.
Where would they start?</p>

<p class="pindent">Somewhere, not far away, there was a soft, long-drawn-out
whisper, like the inefficient whistle of a distant train.</p>

<p class="pindent">He drew his shirt collar back and stole a look out through
the grating at the guards. Those he could see were looking
straight at the launching-dome, somewhere to his left.</p>

<p class="pindent">Again the long harsh whisper. And again.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was getting louder. He could see the heads of the guards
pivoting towards the grating in the wall which hid him and
Gala. They must be watching, fascinated, as the thick white
jets of steam shot out through the gratings high up in the
cement wall, wondering if this one, or that one, or that one,
would be accompanied by a double scream.</p>

<p class="pindent">He could feel Gala’s heart beating against his. She didn’t
know what was coming. She trusted him.</p>

<p class="pindent">“It may hurt,” he whispered to her again. “It may burn.
It won’t kill us. Be brave. Don’t make a sound.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m all right,” she whispered angrily. But he could feel
her body press closer in to his.</p>

<p class="pindent">Whoosh. It was getting closer.</p>

<p class="pindent">Whoosh! Two away.</p>

<p class="pindent">WHOOSH!! Next door. A suspicion of the wet smell of
steam came to him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Hold tight, Bond said to himself. He smothered her in
towards him and held his breath.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now. Quick. Get it over, damn you.</p>

<p class="pindent">And suddenly there was a great pressure and heat and a
roaring in the ears and a moment of blazing pain.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then dead silence, a mixture of sharp cold and fire on the
ankles and hands, a feeling of soaking wet and a desperate,
choking effort to get pure air into the lungs.</p>

<p class="pindent">Their bodies automatically fought to withdraw from each
other, to capture some inches of space and air for the areas
of skin that were already blistering. The breath rattled in
their throats and the water poured off the cement into their
open mouths until they bent sideways and choked the water
out to join the trickle that was oozing under their soaking
bodies and along past their scalded ankles and then down the
vertical walls of the shaft up which they had come.</p>

<p class="pindent">And the howl of the steam pipe drew away from them until
it became a whisper and finally stopped, and there was silence
in their narrow cement prison except for their stubborn
breathing and the ticking of Bond’s watch.</p>

<p class="pindent">And the two bodies lay and waited, nursing their pain.</p>

<p class="pindent">Half an hour—half a year—later, Walter and Krebs and
Drax filed out below them.</p>

<p class="pindent">But, as a precaution, the guards had been left behind in
the launching dome.</p>
