<p class="pindent">Bond sat at his favourite restaurant table in London, the
right-hand corner table for two on the first floor, and
watched the people and the traffic in Piccadilly and down
the Haymarket.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was 7.45 and his second Vodka dry Martini with a large
slice of lemon peel had just been brought to him by Baker,
the head waiter. He sipped it, wondering idly why Gala was
late. It was not like her. She was the sort of girl who would
telephone if she had been kept at the Yard. Vallance, whom
he had visited at five, had said that Gala was due with him
at six.</p>

<p class="pindent">Vallance had been very anxious to see her. He was a
worried man and when Bond reported briefly on the security
of the Moonraker, Vallance seemed to be listening with only
half his mind.</p>

<p class="pindent">It appeared that all that day there had been heavy selling
of sterling. It had started in Tangier and quickly spread to
Zurich and New York. The pound had been fluctuating
wildly in the money markets of the world and the arbitrage
dealers had made a killing. The net result was that the pound
was a whole three cents down on the day and the forward
rates were still weaker. It was front-page news in the evening
papers and at the close of business the Treasury had got on
to Vallance and told him the extraordinary news that the
selling wave had been started by Drax Metals Ltd. in
Tangier. The operation had begun that morning and by close
of business the firm had managed to sell British currency
short to the tune of twenty million pounds. This had been
too much for the markets, and the Bank of England had had
to step in and buy in order to stop a still sharper run. It was
then that Drax Metals had come to light as the seller.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now the Treasury wanted to know what it was all about—whether
it was Drax himself selling or one of the big commodity
interests who were clients of his firm. The first thing
they did was to tackle Vallance. Vallance could only think
that in some way the Moonraker was to be a failure and that
Drax knew it and wanted to profit by his knowledge. He at
once spoke to the Ministry of Supply, but they pooh-poohed
the idea. There was no reason to think the Moonraker would
be a failure and even if its practice flight was not successful
the fact would be covered up with talk of technical hitches and
so forth. In any case, whether the rocket was a success or not,
there could be no possible reaction on British financial credit.
No, they certainly wouldn’t think of mentioning the matter
to the Prime Minister. Drax Metals was a big trading organization.
They were probably acting for some foreign government.
The Argentine. Perhaps even Russia. Someone with
big sterling balances. Anyway it was nothing to do with the
Ministry, or with the Moonraker, which would be launched
punctually at noon the next day.</p>

<p class="pindent">This had made sense to Vallance, but he was still worried.
He didn’t like mysteries and he was glad to share his concern
with Bond. Above all he wanted to ask Gala if she had seen
any Tangier cables and if so whether Drax had made any
comment on them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was sure Gala would have mentioned anything of
the sort to him, and he said so to Vallance. They had talked
some more and then Bond had left for his headquarters where
M. was expecting him.</p>

<p class="pindent">M. had been interested in everything, even the shaven
heads and moustaches of the men. He questioned Bond
minutely and when Bond finished his story with the gist of
his last conversation with Vallance M. sat for a long time lost
in thought.</p>

<p class="pindent">“007,” he said at last, “I don’t like any part of this. There’s
something going on down there but I can’t for the life of me
make any sense out of it. And I don’t see where I can possibly
interfere. All the facts are known to the Special Branch and
to the Ministry and, God knows, I’ve got nothing to add to
them. Even if I had a word with the PM, which would be
damned unfair on Vallance, what am I to tell him? What
facts? What’s it all about? There’s nothing but the smell of
it all. And it’s a bad smell. And,” he added, “a very big one,
if I’m not mistaken.</p>

<p class="pindent">“No,” he looked across at Bond and his eyes held an unusual
note of urgency. “It looks as if it’s all up to you. And
that girl. You’re lucky she’s a good one. Anything you want?
Anything I can do to help?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No, thank you, sir,” Bond had said and he had walked
out through the familiar corridors and down in the lift to his
own office where he had terrified Loelia Ponsonby by giving
her a kiss as he said good-night. The only times he ever did
that were at Christmas, on her birthday, and just before
there was something dangerous to be done.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond drank down the rest of his Martini and looked at his
watch. Now it was eight o’clock and suddenly he shivered.</p>

<p class="pindent">He got straight up from his table and walked out to the
telephone.</p>

<p class="pindent">The switchboard at the Yard said that the Assistant Commissioner
had been trying to reach him. He had had to go
to a dinner at the Mansion House. Could Commander Bond
please stay by the telephone? Bond waited impatiently. All
his fears surged up at him from the chunk of black bakelite.
He could see the rows of polite faces. The uniformed waiter
slowly edging his way round to Vallance. The quickly pulled-back
chair. The unobtrusive exit. Those echoing stone
lobbies. The discreet booth.</p>

<p class="pindent">The telephone screamed at him. “That you, Bond? Vallance
here. Seen anything of Miss Brand?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s heart went cold. “No,” he said sharply. “She’s half
an hour late for dinner. Didn’t she turn up at six?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No, and I’ve had a ‘trace’ sent out and there’s no sign of
her at the usual address she stays at when she comes to
London. None of her friends have seen her. If she left in
Drax’s car at two-thirty she should have been in London
by half-past four. There’s been no crash on the Dover road
during the afternoon and the AA and the RAC are negative.”
There was a pause. “Now listen.” There was urgent
appeal in Vallance’s voice. “She’s a good girl that, and I
don’t want anything to happen to her. Can you handle it for
me? I can’t put out a general call for her. The killing down
there has made her news and we’d have the whole Press
round our ears. It will be even worse after ten tonight. Downing
Street are issuing a communiqué about the practice shoot
and tomorrow’s papers are going to be nothing but Moonraker.
The PM’s going to broadcast. Her disappearance
would turn the whole thing into a crime story. Tomorrow’s
too important for that and anyway the girl may have had a
fainting fit or something. But I want her found. Well? What
do you say? Can you handle it? You can have all the help
you want. I’ll tell the Duty Officer that he’s to accept your
orders.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’t worry,” said Bond. “Of course I’ll look after it.”
He paused, his mind racing. “Just tell me something. What
do you know about Drax’s movements?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“He wasn’t expected at the Ministry until seven,” said
Vallance. “I left word . . .” There was a confused noise on
the line and Bond heard Vallance say “Thanks.” He came
back on the line. “Just got a report passed on by the City
police,” he said. “The Yard couldn’t get me on the ’phone.
Talking to you. Let’s see,” he read, “ ‘Sir Hugo Drax arrived
Ministry 1900 left at 2000. Left message dining at Blades if
wanted. Back at site 2300.’ ” Vallance commented: “That
means he’ll be leaving London about nine. Just a moment.”
He read on: “ ‘Sir Hugo stated Miss Brand felt unwell on
arrival in London but at her request he left her at Victoria
Station bus terminal at 16.45. Miss Brand stated she would
rest with some friends, address unknown, and contact Sir
Hugo at Ministry at 1900. She had not done so.’ And that’s
all,” said Vallance. “Oh, by the way, we made the inquiry
about Miss Brand on your behalf. Said you had arranged to
meet her at six and she hadn’t turned up.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes,” said Bond, his thoughts elsewhere. “That doesn’t
seem to get us anywhere. I’ll have to get busy. Just one more
thing. Has Drax got a place in London, flat or anything like
that?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“He always stays at the Ritz nowadays,” said Vallance.
“Sold his house in Grosvenor Square when he moved down
to Dover. But we happen to know he’s got some sort of an
establishment in Ebury Street. We checked there. But there
was no answer to the bell and my man said the house looked
unoccupied. Just behind Buckingham Palace. Some sort of
hideout of his. Keeps it very quiet. Probably takes his women
there. Anything else? I ought to be getting back or all this big
brass will think the Crown Jewels have been stolen.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You go ahead,” said Bond. “I’ll do my best and if I get
stuck I’ll call on your men to help. Don’t worry if you don’t
hear from me. So long.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“So long,” said Vallance with a note of relief in his voice.
“And thanks. Best of luck.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond rang off.</p>

<p class="pindent">He picked up the receiver again and called Blades.</p>

<p class="pindent">“This is the Ministry of Supply,” he said. “Is Sir Hugo
Drax in the club?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, sir,” it was the friendly voice of Brevett. “He’s in the
dining-room. Do you wish to speak to him?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No, it’s all right,” said Bond. “I just wanted to make
certain he hadn’t left yet.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Without noticing what he was eating Bond wolfed down
some food and left the restaurant at 8.45. His car was outside
waiting for him and he said good-night to the driver from
Headquarters and drove to St James’s Street. He parked
under cover of the central row of taxis outside Boodle’s and
settled himself behind an evening paper over which he could
keep his eyes on a section of Drax’s Mercedes which he was
relieved to see standing in Park Street, unattended.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had not long to wait. Suddenly a broad shaft of yellow
light shone out from the doorway of Blades and the big figure
of Drax appeared. He wore a heavy ulster up round his ears
and a cap pulled down over his eyes. He walked quickly to
the white Mercedes, slammed the door, and was away across
to the left-hand side of St James’s Street and braking to turn
opposite St James’s Palace while Bond was still in third.</p>

<p class="pindent">God, the man moves quickly, thought Bond, doing a racing
change round the island in the Mall with Drax already passing
the statue in front of the Palace. He kept the Bentley in
third and thundered in pursuit. Buckingham Palace Gate. So
it looked like Ebury Street. Keeping the white car just in
view, Bond made hurried plans. The lights at the corner of
Lower Grosvenor Place were green for Drax and red for
Bond. Bond jumped them and was just in time to see Drax
swing left into the beginning of Ebury Street. Gambling on
Drax making a stop at his house, Bond accelerated to the
corner and pulled up just short of it. As he jumped out of the
Bentley, leaving the engine ticking over, and took the few
steps towards Ebury Street, he heard two short blasts on the
Mercedes’ horn and as he carefully edged round the corner
he was in time to see Krebs helping the muffled figure of a
girl across the pavement. Then the door of the Mercedes
slammed and Drax was off again.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond raced back to his car, whipped into third, and went
after him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Thank God the Mercedes was white. There it went, its
stop-lights blazing briefly at the intersections, the headlamps
full on and the horn blaring at any hint of a check in the
sparse traffic.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond set his teeth and rode his car as if she was a Lipizaner
at the Spanish Riding School in Vienna. He could not use
headlights or horn for fear of betraying his presence to the
car in front. He just had to play on his brakes and gears and
hope for the best.</p>

<p class="pindent">The deep note of his two-inch exhaust thundered back at
him from the houses on either side and his tyres screamed on
the tarmac. He thanked heavens for the new set of racing
Michelins that were only a week old. If only the lights would
be kind. He seemed to be getting nothing but amber and red
while Drax was always being swept on by the green. Chelsea
Bridge. So it did look like the Dover road by the South Circular!
Could he hope to keep up with the Mercedes on A20?
Drax had two passengers. His car might not be tuned. But
with that independent springing he could corner better than
Bond. The old Bentley was a bit high off the ground for this
sort of work. Bond stamped on his brakes and risked a howl
on his triple klaxons as a homeward-bound taxi started to
weave over to the right. It jerked back to the left and Bond
heard a four-letter yell as he shot past.</p>

<p class="pindent">Clapham Common and the flicker of the white car through
the trees. Bond ran the Bentley up to eighty along the safe
bit of road and saw the lights go red just in time to stop Drax
at the end of it. He put the Bentley into neutral and coasted
up silently. Fifty yards away. Forty, thirty, twenty. The lights
changed and Drax was over the crossing and away again, but
not before Bond had seen that Krebs was beside the driver
and there was no sign of Gala except the hump of a rug over
the narrow back seat.</p>

<p class="pindent">So there was no question. You don’t take a sick girl for a
drive like a sack of potatoes. Not at that speed for the matter
of that. So she was a prisoner. Why? What had she done?
What had she discovered? What the hell, in fact, was all this
about?</p>

<p class="pindent">Each dark conjecture came and for a moment settled like a
vulture on Bond’s shoulder and croaked into his ear that he
had been a blind fool. Blind, blind, blind. From the moment
he had sat in his office after the night at Blades and made his
mind up about Drax being a dangerous man he should have
been on his toes. At the first smell of trouble, the marks on
the chart for instance, he should have taken action. But what
action? He had passed on each clue, each fear. What could
he have done except kill Drax? And get hanged for his
pains? Well, then. What about the present? Should he stop
and telephone the Yard? And let the car get away? For all
he knew Gala was being taken for a ride and Drax planned to
get rid of her on the way to Dover. And that Bond might
conceivably prevent if only his car could take it.</p>

<p class="pindent">As if to echo his thoughts the tortured rubber screamed as
he left the South Circular road into A20 and took the roundabout
at forty. No. He had told M. that he would stay with it.
He had told Vallance the same. The case had been dumped
firmly into his lap and he must do what he could. At least if
he kept up with the Mercedes he might shoot up its tyres and
apologize afterwards. To let it get away would be criminal.</p>

<p class="pindent">So be it, said Bond to himself.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had to slow for some lights and he used the pause to
pull a pair of goggles out of the dashboard compartment and
cover his eyes with them. Then he leant over to the left and
twisted the big screw on the windscreen and then eased the
one beside his right hand. He pressed the narrow screen flat
down on the bonnet and tightened the screws again.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he accelerated away from Swanley Junction and was
soon doing ninety astride the cat’s eyes down the Farningham
by-pass, the wind howling past his ears and the shrill scream
of his supercharger riding with him for company.</p>

<p class="pindent">A mile ahead the great eyes of the Mercedes hooded
themselves as they went over the crest of Wrotham Hill and
disappeared down into the moonlit panorama of the Weald
of Kent.</p>
