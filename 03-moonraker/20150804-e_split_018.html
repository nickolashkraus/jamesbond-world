<p class="pindent">It was a wonderful afternoon of blue and green and gold.
When they left the concrete apron through the guard-gate
near the empty firing-point, now connected by a thick
cable with the launching site, they stopped for a moment on
the edge of the great chalk cliff and stood gazing over the
whole corner of England where Caesar had first landed two
thousand years before.</p>

<p class="pindent">To their left the carpet of green turf, bright with small
wildflowers, sloped gradually down to the long pebble
beaches of Walmer and Deal, which curved off towards
Sandwich and the Bay. Beyond, the cliffs of Margate, showing
white through the distant haze that hid the North Foreland,
guarded the grey scar of Manston aerodrome above
which American Thunderjets wrote their white scribbles in
the sky. Then came the Isle of Thanet and, out of sight,
the mouth of the Thames.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was low tide and the Goodwins were golden and tender
in the sparkling blue of the Straits with only the smattering
of masts and spars that stretched along their length to tell
the true story. The white lettering on the South Goodwins
Lightship was easy to read and even the name of her sister
ship to the north showed white against the red of her hull.</p>

<p class="pindent">Between the sands of the coast, along the twelve-fathom
channel of the Inner Leads, there were half a dozen ships
beating up through the Downs, the thud of their engines
coming clearly off the quiet sea, and between the evil
sands and the sharp outline of the French coast there were
ships of all registries going about their business—liners, merchantmen,
ungainly Dutch schuyts, and even a slim corvette
hastening down south, perhaps to Portsmouth. As far as the
eye could reach the Eastern Approaches of England were
dotted with traffic plying towards near or distant horizons,
towards a home port, or towards the other side of the world.
It was a panorama full of colour and excitement and
romance and the two people on the edge of the cliff were
silent as they stood for a time and watched it all.</p>

<p class="pindent">The peace was broken by two blasts on the siren from the
house and they turned to gaze back at the ugly concrete
world that had been cleaned out of their minds. As they
watched, a red flag was broken out above the dome of the
launching site and two RAF crash-wagons with red crosses
on their sides rolled out of the trees to the edge of the blast-wall
and pulled up.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Fuelling’s going to begin,” said Bond. “Let’s get on with
our walk. There’ll be nothing to see and if there happened to
be something we probably wouldn’t survive it at this range.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She smiled at him. “Yes,” she said. “And I’m sick of the
sight of all this concrete.”</p>

<p class="pindent">They walked on down the gentle slope and were soon out
of sight of the firing point and the high wire fence.</p>

<p class="pindent">The ice of Gala’s reserve melted quickly in the sunshine.</p>

<p class="pindent">The exotic gaiety of her clothes, a black and white striped
cotton shirt tucked into a wide hand-stitched black leather
belt above a medium length skirt in shocking pink, seemed
to have infected her, and it was impossible for Bond to
recognize the chill woman of the night before in the girl who
now walked beside him and laughed happily at his ignorance
of the names of the wildflowers, the samphire, Viper’s bugloss,
and fumitory round their feet.</p>

<p class="pindent">Triumphantly she found a bee orchis and picked it.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You wouldn’t do that if you knew that flowers scream
when they are picked,” said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala looked at him. “What do you mean?” she asked,
suspecting a joke.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Didn’t you know?” He smiled at her reaction. “There’s
an Indian called Professor Bhose, who’s written a treatise on
the nervous system of flowers. He measured their reaction to
pain. He even recorded the scream of a rose being picked. It
must be one of the most heartrending sounds in the world.
I heard something like it as you picked that flower.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I don’t believe it,” she said, looking suspiciously at the
torn root. “Anyway,” she said maliciously, “I wouldn’t have
thought you were a person to get sentimental. Don’t people
in your section of the Service make a business of killing?
And not just flowers either. People.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Flowers can’t shoot back,” said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked at the orchis. “Now you’ve made me feel like
a murderer. It’s very unkind of you. But,” she admitted reluctantly,
“I shall have to find out about this Indian and if
you’re right I shall never pick a flower again as long as I live.
What am I to going to do with this one? You make me feel
it’s bleeding all over my hands.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Give it to me,” said Bond. “According to you, my hands
are dripping with blood already. A little more won’t hurt.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She handed it to him and their hands touched. “You can
stick it in the muzzle of your revolver,” she said to cover the
flash of contact.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. “So the eyes aren’t only for decoration,” he
said. “Anyway it’s an automatic and I left it in my room.”
He drew the stalk of the flower through one of the buttonholes
in his blue cotton shirt. “I thought a shoulder-holster
would look a bit conspicuous without a coat to cover it.
And I don’t think anyone will be going over my room this
afternoon.”</p>

<p class="pindent">By tacit agreement they edged away from the moment of
warmth. Bond told her of his discovery of Krebs and of the
scene in his bedroom.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Serves him right,” she said. “I’ve never trusted him. But
what did Sir Hugo say?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I had a word with him before lunch,” said Bond. “Gave
him Krebs’s knife and keys as proof. He was furious and
went straight off to see the man, muttering with rage. When
he came back he said that Krebs seemed to be in a pretty
bad way and was I satisfied that he’d been punished enough?
All that business about not wanting to upset the team at the
last moment and so forth. So I agreed that he’d be sent back
to Germany next week and that meanwhile he would consider
himself under open arrest—only allowed out of his
room under surveillance.”</p>

<p class="pindent">They scrambled down a steep cliff-path to the beach and
turned to the right beside the deserted small-arms range of
the Royal Marine Garrison at Deal. They walked along in
silence until they came to the two-mile stretch of shingle that
runs at low tide beneath the towering white cliffs to St
Margaret’s Bay.</p>

<p class="pindent">As they trudged slowly through the deep smooth pebbles
Bond told her of all that had gone through his mind since
the previous day. He held nothing back and he showed each
false hare as it had been started and finally run to earth,
leaving nothing but a thin scent of ill-founded suspicions
and a muddle of clues that all ended in the same question
mark . . . where was a pattern? Where was a plan into which
the clues would fit? And always the same answer, that
nothing Bond knew or suspected seemed to have any conceivable
bearing on the security from sabotage of the Moonraker.
And that, when all was said and done, was the only
matter with which he and the girl were concerned. Not with
the death of Tallon and Bartsch, not with the egregious
Krebs, but only with the protection of the whole Moonraker
project from its possible enemies.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Isn’t that so?” Bond concluded.</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala stopped and stood for a moment looking out across
the tumbled rocks and seaweed towards the quiet glimmering
swell of the sea. She was hot and out of breath from the
hard going through the shingle and she thought how wonderful
it would be to bathe—to step back for a moment into
those childish days beside the sea before her life had been
caught up in this strange cold profession with its tensions and
hollow thrills. She glanced at the ruthless brown face of the
man beside her. Did he have moments of longing for the
peaceful simple things of life? Of course not. He liked Paris
and Berlin and New York and trains and aeroplanes and
expensive food, and, yes certainly, expensive women.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well?” said Bond, wondering if she was going to come
out with some piece of evidence that he had overlooked.
“What do you think?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m sorry,” said Gala. “I was dreaming. No,” she answered
his question. “I think you’re right. I’ve been down
here since the beginning and although there’ve been odd
little things from time to time, and of course the shooting,
I’ve seen absolutely nothing wrong. Every one of the team,
from Sir Hugo down, is heart and soul behind the rocket. It’s
all they live for and it’s been wonderful to see the whole thing
grow. The Germans are terrific workers—and I can quite
believe that Bartsch broke under the strain—and they love
being driven by Sir Hugo and he loves driving them. They
worship him. And as for security, the place is solid with it
and I’m sure that anyone who tried to get near the Moonraker
would be torn to pieces. I agree with you about Krebs
and that he was probably working under Drax’s orders. It
was because I believed that, that I didn’t bother to report
him when he went through my things. There was nothing
for him to find, of course. Just private letters and so on. It
would be typical of Sir Hugo to make absolutely sure. And I
must say,” she said candidly, “that I admire him for it. He’s
a ruthless man with deplorable manners and not a very nice
face under all that red hair, but I love working for him and
I’m longing for the Moonraker to be a success. Living with it
for so long has made me feel just like his men do about it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked up to see his reactions.</p>

<p class="pindent">He nodded. “After only a day I can understand that,” he
said. “And I suppose I agree with you. There’s nothing to
go on except my intuition and that will have to look after
itself. The main thing is that the Moonraker looks as safe as
the Crown Jewels, and probably safer.” He shrugged his
shoulders impatiently, dissatisfied with himself for disowning
the intuitions that were so much of his trade. “Come on,” he
said, almost roughly. “We’re wasting time.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Understanding, she smiled to herself and followed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Round the next bend of the cliff they came up with the
base of the hoist, encrusted with seaweed and barnacles.
Fifty yards further on they reached the jetty, a strong tubular
iron frame paved with latticed iron strips that ran out over
the rocks and beyond.</p>

<p class="pindent">Between the two, and perhaps twenty feet up the cliff face,
yawned the wide black mouth of the exhaust tunnel which
slanted up inside the cliff to the steel floor beneath the stern
of the rocket. From the under-lip of the cave melted chalk
drooled like lava and there were splashes of the stuff all over
the pebbles and rocks below. In his mind’s eye Bond could
see the blazing white shaft of flame come howling out of the
face of the cliff and he could hear the sea hiss and bubble as
the liquid chalk poured into the water.</p>

<p class="pindent">He looked up at the narrow section of the launching dome
that showed above the edge of the cliff two hundred feet up
in the sky, and imagined the four men in their gas-masks and
asbestos suits watching the gauges as the terrible liquid explosive
pulsed down the black rubber tube into the stomach
of the rocket. He suddenly realized that they were in range
if anything went wrong with the fuelling.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Let’s get away from here,” he said to the girl.</p>

<p class="pindent">When they had put a hundred yards between themselves
and the cave Bond stopped and looked back. He imagined
himself with six tough men and all the right gear, and he
wondered how he would set about attacking the site from
the sea—kyaks to the jetty at low tide; a ladder to the lip of
the cave? and then what? Impossible to climb the polished
steel walls of the exhaust tunnel. It would be a question of
firing an anti-tank weapon through the steel floor beneath
the rocket, following up with some phosphorus shells and
hoping that something would catch fire. Untidy business, but
it might be effective. Getting away afterwards would be
nasty. Sitting targets from the top of the cliff. But that
wouldn’t worry a Russian suicide squad. It was all quite
feasible.</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala had been standing beside him watching the eyes that
measured and speculated. “It’s not as easy as you might
think,” she said, seeing the frown on his face. “Even when
it’s high tide and very rough they have guards along the top
of the cliff at night. And they’ve got searchlights and Brens
and grenades. Their orders are to shoot and ask questions
afterwards. Of course it would be better to floodlight the
cliff at night. But that would only pinpoint the site. I really
believe they’ve thought of everything.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was still frowning. “If they had covering fire from
a submarine or an X-craft, a good team could still do it,” he
said. “It’ll be hell, but I’m going for a swim. The Admiralty
chart says there’s a twelve-fathom channel out there, but I’d
like to have a look. There must be plenty of water at the end
of the jetty but I’ll be happier when I’ve seen for myself.” He
smiled at her. “Why don’t you have a bathe too? It’s going
to be dam’ cold, but it would do you good after stewing inside
that concrete dome all the morning.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Gala’s eyes lit up. “Do you think I could?” she asked
doubtfully. “I’m frightfully hot. But what are we going to
wear?” She blushed at the thought of her brief and almost
transparent nylon pants and brassière.</p>

<p class="pindent">“To hell with that,” said Bond airily. “You must have got
some bits and pieces on underneath and I’ve got pants on.
We shall be perfectly respectable and there’s no one to see,
and I promise not to look,” he lied cheerfully, leading the
way round the next bend in the cliff. “You undress behind
that rock and I’ll use this one,” he said. “Come on. Don’t be
a goose. It’s all in the line of duty.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Without waiting for her to answer he moved behind the
tall rock, taking off his shirt as he did so.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, well,” said Gala, relieved to have the decision taken
out of her hands. She went behind her rock and slowly unbuttoned
her skirt.</p>

<p class="pindent">When she peered nervously out, Bond was already halfway
down the strip of coarse brown sand that led out among
the pools to where the incoming tide eddied through the
green and black moraine of the rocks. He looked lithe and
brown. The blue pants were reassuring.</p>

<p class="pindent">Gingerly she followed him, and then suddenly she was in
the water. At once nothing else mattered but the velvet ice of
the sea and the beauty of the patches of sand between the
waving hair of the seaweed that she could see in the clear
green depths below her as she buried her head and swam
along parallel with the shore in a fast crawl.</p>

<p class="pindent">When she was level with the jetty she stopped for a
moment to get her breath. There was no sign of Bond whom
she had last seen streaking along a hundred yards ahead of
her. She trod water hard to keep up her circulation and then
started back again, unwillingly thinking of him, thinking of
the hard brown body that must be somewhere near her,
among the rocks, perhaps, or diving to the sand to gauge
the depth of water that would be available to an enemy.</p>

<p class="pindent">She turned back to look for him again and it was then
that he suddenly surged up from the sea beneath her. She
felt the quick tight clasp of his arms round her and the swift
hard impact of his lips on hers.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Damn you,” she said furiously, but already he had dived
again and by the time she had spat out a mouthful of seawater
and got her bearings he was swimming blithely twenty
yards away.</p>

<p class="pindent">She turned and swam aloofly out to sea, feeling rather
ridiculous but determined to snub him. It was just as she
had thought. These Secret Service people always seemed to
have time for sex however important their jobs might be.</p>

<p class="pindent">But her body obstinately tingled with the shock of the kiss
and the golden day seemed to have taken on a new beauty.
As she swam further out to sea and then turned back and
looked along the snarling milk-white teeth of England to
the distant arm of Dover and at the black and white confetti
of the ravens and gulls tossed against the vivid backcloth of
green fields, she decided that anything was permissible on
such a day and that, just this once, she would forgive him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Half an hour later they were lying, waiting for the sun to
dry them, separated by a respectable yard of sand at the foot
of the cliff.</p>

<p class="pindent">The kiss had not been mentioned, but Gala’s efforts to preserve
an atmosphere of aloofness had collapsed under the
excitement of examining a lobster that Bond had dived for
and caught with his hands. Reluctantly they put it back into
one of the rockpools and watched it scuttle backwards into
the shelter of the seaweed. And now they lay, tired and exhilarated
by their icy swim, and prayed that the sun would
not slip behind the cliff top high above their heads before they
were warm and dry enough to get back into their clothes.</p>

<p class="pindent">But those were not Bond’s only thoughts. The beautiful
strapping body of the girl beside him, incredibly erotic in
the tight emphasis of the clinging brassière and pants, came
between him and his concern about the Moonraker. And
anyway there was nothing he could do about the Moonraker
for another hour. It was not yet five o’clock and the fuelling
would not be finished until after six. It would only be then
that he could get hold of Drax and make certain that for the
next two nights the guards were strengthened on the cliff and
that they had the right weapons. For he had seen for himself
that there was plenty of water, even at low tide, for a
submarine.</p>

<p class="pindent">So there was at least a quarter of an hour to spare before
they would have to start back.</p>

<p class="pindent">Meanwhile this girl. The half-stripped body splayed above
him on the surface as he swam up from below; the soft-hard
quick kiss with his arms about her; the pointed hillocks of
her breasts, so close to him, and the soft flat stomach descending
to the mystery of her tightly closed thighs.</p>

<p class="pindent">To hell with it.</p>

<p class="pindent">He wrenched his mind out of its fever and gazed straight
up into the endless blue of the sky, forcing himself to watch
the soaring beauty of the herring gulls as they ranged effortlessly
among the air currents that fountained up over the
high clifftop above them. But the soft down of the birds’
white underbellies seduced his thoughts back to her and gave
him no rest.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Why are you called Gala?” he said to break his hot
crouching thoughts.</p>

<p class="pindent">She laughed. “I was teased about it all through school,”
she said, and Bond was impatient at the easy, clear voice,
“and then through the Wrens and then by half the police
force of London. But my real name’s even worse. It’s Galatea.
She was a cruiser my father was serving in when I was
born. I suppose Gala’s not too bad. I’ve almost forgotten
what I’m called. I’m always having to change my name now
that I’m in the Special Branch.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“In the Special Branch.” “In the Special Branch.” “In
the . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">When the bomb falls. When the pilot miscalculates and
the plane hits short of the runway. When the blood leaves
the heart and consciousness goes, there are thoughts in the
mind, or words, or perhaps a phrase of music, which ring on
for the few seconds before death like the dying clang of a bell.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond wasn’t killed, but the words were still in his mind,
several seconds later, after it had all happened.</p>

<p class="pindent">Ever since they had lain down on the sand up against the
cliff, while his thoughts had been of Gala, his eyes had been
carelessly watching two gulls playing around a wisp of straw
that was the edge of their nest on a small ledge about ten feet
below the distant top of the cliff. They would crane and bow
in their love-play, with only their heads visible to Bond
against the dazzling white of the chalk, and then the male
would soar out and away and at once back to the ledge to
take up his love-making again.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was dreamily watching them as he listened to the
girl, when suddenly both gulls dashed away from the ledge
with a single shrill scream of fear. At the same moment there
was a puff of black smoke and a soft boom from the top of
the cliff and a great section of the white chalk directly above
Bond and Gala seemed to sway outwards, zigzag cracks
snaking down its face.</p>

<p class="pindent">The next thing Bond knew was that he was lying on top
of Gala, his face pressed into her cheek, that the air was full
of thunder, that his breath was stifled and that the sun had
gone out. His back was numb and aching under a great
weight and in his left ear, besides the echo of the thunder,
there was the end of a choking scream.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was barely conscious and he had to wait until his senses
came halfway back to life.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Special Branch. What was it she had said about the
Special Branch?</p>

<p class="pindent">He made frantic efforts to move. Only in his right arm,
the arm nearest to the cliff, was there any play at all, but as
he jerked his shoulder the arm became freer until at last,
with a great backward heave, light and air reached down to
them. Retching in the fog of chalk-dust, he widened the hole
until his head could take its crushing weight off Gala. He
felt the feeble movement as she turned her head sideways
towards the light and air. A growing trickle of dust and
stones into the hole he had cleared made him dig fiercely
again. Gradually he enlarged the space until he could get a
purchase on his right elbow and then, coughing so that he
thought his lungs would burst, he heaved his right shoulder
up until suddenly it and his head were free.</p>

<p class="pindent">His first thought was that there had been an explosion in
the Moonraker. He looked up at the cliff and then along the
shore. No. They were a hundred yards from the site. It was
only in the skyline directly above them that a great mouthful
had been bitten out of the cliff.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he thought of their immediate danger. Gala moaned
and he could feel the frantic thud of her heart against his
chest, but the ghastly white mask of her face was now free
to the air and he wrenched his body from side to side on top
of her to try and ease the pressure on her lungs and stomach.
Slowly, inch by inch, his muscles cracking under the strain,
he worked his way under the pile of dust and rubble towards
the cliff face where he knew the weight would be less.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then at last his chest was free and he could snake his
body into a kneeling position beside her. Blood dripped from
his cut back and arms and mingled with the chalk dust that
continually poured down the sides of the hole he had made,
but he could feel that no bones were broken and, in the rage
of the rescue work, he felt no pain.</p>

<p class="pindent">Grunting and coughing and without a pause to take breath
he heaved her up into a sitting position and with a bleeding
hand wiped some of the chalk dust from her face. Then,
freeing his legs from the tomb of chalk, he somehow manhandled
her up on to the top of the mound with her back
against the cliff.</p>

<p class="pindent">He knelt and looked at her, at the terrible white scarecrow
that minutes before had been one of the most beautiful
girls he had ever seen, and as he looked at her and at the
streaks of his blood down her face he prayed that her eyes
would open.</p>

<p class="pindent">When, seconds later, they did, the relief was so great that
Bond turned away and was rackingly sick.</p>
