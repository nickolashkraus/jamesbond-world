<p class="pindent">“. . . Two hundred dead so far and about the same number
missing,” said M. “Reports still coming in from the
East Coast and there’s bad news from Holland. Breached
miles of their sea defences. Most of our losses were among
the patrol craft. Two of them capsized, including the <span class="it">Merganzer</span>.
Commanding Officer missing. And that BBC chap.
Goodwin Lightships broke their moorings. No news from
Belgium or France yet. There are going to be some pretty
heavy bills to pay when everything gets sorted out.”</p>

<p class="pindent">It was the next afternoon and Bond, a rubber-tipped stick
beside his chair, was back where he had started—across the
desk from the quiet man with the cold grey eyes who had
invited him to dinner and a game of cards a hundred years
ago.</p>

<p class="pindent">Under his clothes Bond was latticed with surgical tape.
Pain burned up his legs whenever he moved his feet. There
was a vivid red streak across his left cheek and the bridge of
his nose, and the tannic ointment dressing glinted in the light
from the window. He held a cigarette clumsily in one gloved
hand. Incredibly M. had invited him to smoke.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Any news of the submarine, sir?” he asked.</p>

<p class="pindent">“They’ve located her,” said M. with satisfaction. “Lying
on her side in about thirty fathoms. The salvage ship that
was to look after the remains of the rocket is over her now.
The divers have been down and there’s no answer to signals
against her hull. The Soviet Ambassador has been round at
the Foreign Office this morning. I gather he says a salvage
ship is on her way down from the Baltic, but we’ve said that
we can’t wait as the wreck’s a danger to navigation.” M.
chuckled. “So she would be I dare say if anyone happened
to be navigating at thirty fathoms in the Channel. But I’m
glad I’m not a member of the Cabinet,” he added drily.
“They’ve been in session on and off since the end of the
broadcast. Vallance got hold of those Edinburgh solicitors
before they’d opened Drax’s message to the world. I gather
it’s a terrific document. Reads as if it had been written by
Jehovah. Vallance took it to the Cabinet last night and
stayed at No. 10 to fill in the blanks.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I know,” said Bond. “He kept on telephoning me at the
hospital for details until after midnight. I could hardly think
straight for all the dope they’d pushed into me. What’s going
to happen?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“They’re going to try the biggest cover-up job in history,”
said M. “A lot of scientific twaddle about the fuel having
been only half used up. Unexpectedly powerful explosion on
impact. Full compensation will be paid. Tragic loss of Sir
Hugo Drax and his team. Great patriot. Tragic loss of one
of HM submarines. Latest experimental model. Orders misunderstood.
Very sad. Fortunately only a skeleton crew. Next
of kin will be informed. Tragic loss of BBC man. Unaccountable
error in mistaking White Ensign for Soviet naval colours.
Very similar design. White Ensign recovered from the
wreck.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“But what about the atomic explosion?” asked Bond.
“Radiation and atomic dust and all that. The famous mushroom-shaped
cloud. Surely that’s going to be a bit of a
problem.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Apparently it’s not worrying them too much,” said M.
“The cloud is going to be passed off as the normal formation
after an explosion of that size. The Ministry of Supply know
the whole story. Had to be told. Their men were down on
the East Coast all last night with Geiger counters and there’s
not been a positive report yet.” M. smiled coldly. “The
cloud’s got to come down somewhere, of course, but by a
happy chance such wind as there is is drifting it up north.
Back home, as you might say.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled painfully. “I see,” he said. “How very
appropriate.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course,” continued M., picking up his pipe and starting
to fill it, “there are going to be some nasty rumours.
They’ve begun already. A lot of people saw you and Miss
Brand being brought out of the site on stretchers. Then
there’s the Bowaters’ case against Drax for the loss of all that
newsprint. There’ll be the inquest on the young man who
was killed in the Alfa Romeo. And somebody’s got to explain
away the remains of your car, amongst which,” he looked
accusingly at Bond, “a long-barrel Colt was found. And then
there’s the Ministry of Supply. Vallance had to call some
of their men yesterday to help clean out that house in Ebury
Street. But those people are trained to keep secrets. You
won’t get a leak there. Naturally it’s going to be a risky
business. The big lie always is. But what’s the alternative?
Trouble with Germany? War with Russia? Lots of people
on both sides of the Atlantic would be only too glad of an
excuse.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M. paused and put a match to his pipe. “If the story
holds,” he continued reflectively, “we shan’t come out of this
too badly. We’ve wanted one of their high-speed U-boats and
we’ll be glad of the clues we can pick up about their atom
bombs. The Russians know that we know that their gamble
failed. Malenkov’s none too firmly in the saddle and this may
mean another Kremlin revolt. As for the Germans. Well, we
all knew there was plenty of Nazism left and this will make
the Cabinet go just a bit more carefully on German rearmament.
And, as a very minor consequence,” he gave a wry
smile, “it will make Vallance’s security job, and mine for the
matter of that, just a little bit easier in the future. These
politicians can’t see that the atomic age has created the most
deadly saboteur in the history of the world—the little man
with the heavy suitcase.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Will the Press wear the story?” asked Bond dubiously.</p>

<p class="pindent">M. shrugged his shoulders. “The Prime Minister saw the
editors this morning,” he said, putting another match to his
pipe, “and I gather he’s got away with it so far. If the
rumours get bad later on, he’ll probably have to see them
again and tell them some of the truth. Then they’ll play all
right. They always do when it’s important enough. The main
thing is to gain time and stave off the firebrands. For the
moment everyone’s so proud of the Moonraker that they’re
not inquiring too closely into what went wrong.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a soft burr from the intercom, on M.’s desk
and a ruby light winked on and off. M. picked up the single
earphone and leant towards it. “Yes?” he said. There was
a pause. “I’ll take it on the Cabinet line.” He picked up the
white receiver from the bank of four telephones.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes,” said M. “Speaking.” There was a pause. “Yes, sir?
Over.” M. pressed down the button of his scrambler. He held
the receiver close to his ear and not a sound from it reached
Bond. There was a long pause during which M. puffed occasionally
at the pipe in his left hand. He took it out of his
mouth. “I agree, sir.” Another pause. “I know my man
would have been very proud, sir. But of course it’s a rule
here.” M. frowned. “If you will allow me to say so, sir, I think
it would be very unwise.” A pause, then M.’s face cleared.
“Thank you, sir. And of course Vallance has not got the same
problem. And it would be the least she deserves.” Another
pause. “I understand. That will be done.” Another pause.
“That’s very kind of you, sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M. put the white receiver back on its cradle and the scrambler
button clicked back to the <span class="it">en clair</span> position.</p>

<p class="pindent">For a moment M. continued to look at the telephone as
if in doubt about what had been said. Then he twisted his
chair away from the desk and gazed thoughtfully out of the
window.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was silence in the room and Bond shifted in his chair
to ease the pain that was creeping back into his body.</p>

<p class="pindent">The same pigeon as on Monday, or perhaps another one,
came to rest on the window-sill with the same clatter of
wings. It walked up and down, nodding and cooing, and then
planed off towards the trees in the park. The traffic murmured
sleepily in the distance.</p>

<p class="pindent">How nearly it had come, thought Bond, to being stilled.
How nearly there might be nothing now but the distant clang
of the ambulance bells beneath a lurid black and orange sky,
the stench of burning, the screams of people still trapped in
the buildings. The softly beating heart of London silenced
for a generation. And a whole generation of her people dead
in the streets amongst the ruins of a civilization that might
not rise again for centuries.</p>

<p class="pindent">All that would have come about but for a man who scornfully
cheated at cards to feed the fires of his maniac ego; but
for the stuffy chairman of Blades who detected him; but for
M. who agreed to help an old friend; but for Bond’s half-remembered
lessons from a card-sharper; but for Vallance’s
precautions; but for Gala’s head for figures; but for a whole
pattern of tiny circumstances, a whole pattern of chance.</p>

<p class="pindent">Whose pattern?</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a shrill squeak as M.’s chair swivelled round.
Bond carefully focused again on the grey eyes across the desk.</p>

<p class="pindent">“That was the Prime Minister,” M. said gruffly. “Says he
wants you and Miss Brand out of the country.” M. lowered
his eyes and looked stolidly into the bowl of his pipe. “You’re
both to be out by tomorrow afternoon. There are too many
people in this case who know your faces. Might put two and
two together, when they see the shape you’re both in. Go
anywhere you like. Unlimited expenses for both of you. Any
currency you like. I’ll tell the Paymaster. Stay away for a
month. But keep out of circulation. You’d both be gone this
afternoon only the girl’s got an appointment at eleven tomorrow
morning. At the Palace. Immediate award of the
George Cross. Won’t be gazetted until the New Year of
course. Like to meet her one day. Must be a good girl. As a
matter of fact,” M.’s expression as he looked up was unreadable,
“the Prime Minister had something in mind for you.
Forgotten that we don’t go in for those sort of things here.
So he asked me to thank you for him. Said some nice things
about the Service. Very kind of him.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M. gave one of the rare smiles that lit up his face with
quick brightness and warmth. Bond smiled back. They understood
the things that had to be left unsaid.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond knew it was time to go. He got up. “Thank you very
much, sir,” he said. “And I’m glad about the girl.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“All right then,” said M. on a note of dismissal. “Well,
that’s the lot. See you in a month. Oh and by the way,” he
added casually. “Call in at your office. You’ll find something
there from me. Little memento.”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond went down in the lift and limped along the
familiar corridor to his office. When he walked through the
inner door he found his secretary arranging some papers on
the next desk to his.</p>

<p class="pindent">“008 coming back?” he asked.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes,” she smiled happily. “He’s being flown out tonight.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, I’m glad you’ll have company,” said Bond. “I’m
going off again.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh,” she said. She looked quickly at his face and then
away. “You look as if you needed a bit of a rest.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m going to get one,” said Bond. “A month’s exile.”
He thought of Gala. “It’s going to be pure holiday. Anything
for me?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Your new car’s downstairs. I’ve inspected it. The man
said you’d ordered it on trial this morning. It looks lovely.
Oh, and there’s a parcel from M.’s office. Shall I unpack it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, do,” said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">He sat down at his desk and looked at his watch. Five
o’clock. He was feeling tired. He knew he was going to feel
tired for several days. He always got these reactions at the
end of an ugly assignment, the aftermath of days of taut
nerves, tension, fear.</p>

<p class="pindent">His secretary came back into the room with two heavy-looking
cardboard boxes. She put them on his desk and he
opened the top one. When he saw the grease-paper he knew
what to expect.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a card in the box. He took it out and read it. In
M.’s green ink it said: “You may be needing these.” There
was no signature.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond unwrapped the grease-paper and cradled the shining
new Beretta in his hand. A memento. No. A reminder. He
shrugged his shoulders and slipped the gun under his coat
into the empty holster. He got clumsily to his feet.</p>

<p class="pindent">“There’ll be a long-barrel Colt in the other box,” he said
to his secretary. “Keep it until I get back. Then I’ll take it
down to the range and fire it in.”</p>

<p class="pindent">He walked to the door. “So long, Lil,” he said, “regards
to 008 and tell him to be careful of you. I’ll be in France.
Station F will have the address. But only in an emergency.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She smiled at him. “How much of an emergency?” she
asked.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gave a short laugh. “Any invitation to a quiet game
of bridge,” he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">He limped out and shut the door behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">The 1953 Mark VI had an open touring body. It was
battleship grey like the old 4½ litre that had gone to its grave
in a Maidstone garage, and the dark blue leather upholstery
gave a luxurious hiss as he climbed awkwardly in beside the
test driver.</p>

<p class="pindent">Half an hour later the driver helped him out at the corner
of Birdcage Walk and Queen Anne’s Gate. “We could get
more speed out of her if you want it, sir,” he said. “If we
could have her back for a fortnight we could tune her to do
well over the hundred.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Later,” said Bond. “She’s sold. On one condition. That
you get her over to the ferry terminal at Calais by tomorrow
evening.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The test driver grinned. “Roger,” he said. “I’ll take her
over myself. See you on the pier, sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Fine,” said Bond. “Go easy on A20. The Dover road’s a
dangerous place these days.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’t worry, sir,” said the driver, thinking that this man
must be a bit of a cissy for all that he seemed to know plenty
about motor-cars. “Piece of cake.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Not every day,” said Bond with a smile. “See you at
Calais.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Without waiting for a reply, he limped off with his stick
through the dusty bars of evening sunlight that filtered down
through the trees in the park.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat down on one of the seats opposite the island in
the lake and took out his cigarette-case and lit a cigarette.
He looked at his watch. Five minutes to six. He reminded
himself that she was the sort of girl who would be punctual.
He had reserved the corner table for dinner. And then?
But first there would be the long luxurious planning. What
would she like? Where would she like to go? Where had she
ever been? Germany, of course. France? Miss out Paris.
They could do that on their way back. Get as far as they
could the first night, away from the Pas de Calais. There was
that farmhouse with the wonderful food between Montreuil
and Etaples. Then the fast sweep down to the Loire. The
little places near the river for a few days. Not the château
towns. Places like Beaugency, for instance. Then slowly
south, always keeping to the western roads, avoiding the five-star
life. Slowly exploring. Bond pulled himself up. Exploring
what? Each other? Was he getting serious about this girl?</p>

<p class="pindent">“James.”</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a clear, high, rather nervous voice. Not the voice he
had expected.</p>

<p class="pindent">He looked up. She was standing a few feet away from him.
He noticed that she was wearing a black beret at a rakish
angle and that she looked exciting and mysterious like someone
you see driving by abroad, alone in an open car, someone
unattainable and more desirable than anyone you have ever
known. Someone who is on her way to make love to somebody
else. Someone who is not for you.</p>

<p class="pindent">He got up and they took each other’s hands.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was she who released herself. She didn’t sit down.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I wish you were going to be there tomorrow, James.” Her
eyes were soft as she looked at him. Soft, but, he thought,
somehow evasive.</p>

<p class="pindent">He smiled. “Tomorrow morning or tomorrow night?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’t be ridiculous,” she laughed, blushing. “I meant at
the Palace.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What are you going to do afterwards?” asked Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked at him carefully. What did the look remind
him of? The Morphy look? The look he had given Drax on
that last hand at Blades? No. Not quite. There was something
else there. Tenderness? Regret?</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked over his shoulder.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned round. A hundred yards away there was the
tall figure of a young man with fair hair trimmed short. His
back was towards them and he was idling along, killing time.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned back and Gala’s eyes met his squarely.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m going to marry that man,” she said quietly. “Tomorrow
afternoon.” And then, as if no other explanation was
needed, “His name’s Detective-Inspector Vivian.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh,” said Bond. He smiled stiffly. “I see.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a moment of silence during which their eyes slid
away from each other.</p>

<p class="pindent">And yet why should he have expected anything else? A
kiss. The contact of two frightened bodies clinging together
in the midst of danger. There had been nothing more. And
there had been the engagement ring to tell him. Why had he
automatically assumed that it had only been worn to keep
Drax at bay? Why had he imagined that she shared his
desires, his plans?</p>

<p class="pindent">And now what? wondered Bond. He shrugged his shoulders
to shift the pain of failure—the pain of failure that is so
much greater than the pleasure of success. The exit line. He
must get out of these two young lives and take his cold heart
elsewhere. There must be no regrets. No false sentiment. He
must play the role which she expected of him. The tough man
of the world. The Secret Agent. The man who was only a
silhouette.</p>

<p class="pindent">She was looking at him rather nervously, waiting to be
relieved of the stranger who had tried to get his foot in the
door of her heart.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled warmly at her. “I’m jealous,” he said. “I had
other plans for you tomorrow night.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She smiled back at him, grateful that the silence had been
broken. “What were they?” she asked.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I was going to take you off to a farmhouse in France,” he
said. “And after a wonderful dinner I was going to see if it’s
true what they say about the scream of a rose.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She laughed. “I’m sorry I can’t oblige. But there are plenty
of others waiting to be picked.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, I suppose so,” said Bond. “Well, goodbye, Gala.”
He held out his hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Goodbye, James.”</p>

<p class="pindent">He touched her for the last time and then they turned
away from each other and walked off into their different
lives.</p>
