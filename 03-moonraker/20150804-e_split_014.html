<p class="pindent">It was like being inside the polished barrel of a huge gun.</p>

<p class="pindent">From the floor, forty feet below, rose circular walls of
polished metal near the top of which he and Drax clung like
two flies. Up through the centre of the shaft, which was about
thirty feet wide, soared a pencil of glistening chromium,
whose point, tapering to a needle-sharp antenna, seemed to
graze the roof twenty feet above their heads.</p>

<p class="pindent">The shimmering projectile rested on a blunt cone of latticed
steel which rose from the floor between the tips of three
severely back-swept delta fins that looked as sharp as surgeons’
scalpels. But otherwise nothing marred the silken
sheen of the fifty feet of polished chrome steel except the
spidery fingers of two light gantries which stood out from
the walls and clasped the waist of the rocket between thick
pads of foam-rubber.</p>

<p class="pindent">Where they touched the rocket, small access doors stood
open in the steel skin and, as Bond looked down, a man
crawled out of one door on to the narrow platform of the
gantry and closed the door behind him with a gloved hand.
He walked gingerly along the narrow bridge to the wall and
turned a handle. There was a sharp whine of machinery
and the gantry took its padded hand off the rocket and held
it poised in the air like the forelegs of a praying mantis. The
whine altered to a deeper tone and the gantry slowly telescoped
in on itself. Then it reached out again and seized the
rocket ten feet lower down. Its operator crawled out along its
arm and opened another small access door and disappeared
inside.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Probably checking the fuel-feed from the after tanks,”
said Drax. “Gravity feed. Tricky bit of design. What do you
think of her?” He looked with pleasure at Bond’s rapt expression.</p>

<p class="pindent">“One of the most beautiful things I’ve ever seen,” said
Bond. It was easy to talk. There was hardly a sound in the
great steel shaft and the voices of the men clustered below
under the tail of the rocket were no more than a murmur.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax pointed upwards. “Warhead,” he explained. “Experimental
one now. Full of instruments. Telemeters and so
forth. Then the gyros just opposite us here. Then mostly
fuel tanks all the way down until you get to the turbines near
the tail. Driven by superheated steam, made by decomposing
hydrogen peroxide. The fuel, fluorine and hydrogen” (he
glanced sharply at Bond. “That’s top-secret by the way”)
“falls down the feed tubes and gets ignited as soon as it’s
forced into the motor. Sort of controlled explosion which
shoots the rocket into the air. That steel floor under the rocket
slides away. There’s a big exhaust pit underneath. Comes out
at the base of the cliff. You’ll see it tomorrow. Looks like a
huge cave. When we ran a static test the other day the chalk
melted and ran out into the sea like water. Hope we don’t
burn down the famous white cliffs when we come to the real
thing. Like to come and have a look at the works?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond followed silently as Drax led the way down the steep
iron ladder that curved down the side of the steel wall. He
felt a glow of admiration and almost of reverence for this
man and his majestic achievement. How could he ever have
been put off by Drax’s childish behaviour at the card-table?
Even the greatest men have their weaknesses. Drax must have
an outlet for the tension of the fantastic responsibility he was
carrying. It was clear from the conversation at dinner that
he couldn’t shed much on to the shoulders of his highly-strung
deputy. From him alone had to spring the vitality and
confidence to buoy up his whole team. Even in such a small
thing as winning at cards it must be important to him to be
constantly reassuring himself, constantly searching out omens
of good fortune and success, even to the point of creating
these omens for himself. Who, Bond asked himself, wouldn’t
sweat and bite his nails when so much had been dared, when
so much was at stake?</p>

<p class="pindent">As they filed down the long curve of the stairway, their
figures grotesquely reflected back at them by the mirror of
the rocket’s chromium skin, Bond almost felt the man-in-the-street’s
affection for the man whom, only a few hours
previously, he had been dissecting without pity, almost with
loathing.</p>

<p class="pindent">When they reached the steel-plated floor of the shaft,
Drax paused and looked up. Bond followed his eyes. Seen
from that angle it seemed as if they were gazing up a thin
straight shaft of light into the blazing heaven of the arcs, a
shaft of light that was not pure white but a shot mother-of-pearl
satin. There were shimmers of red in it picked up from
the crimson canisters of a giant foam fire-extinguisher that
stood near them, a man in an asbestos suit beside it aiming
its nozzle at the base of the rocket. There was a streak of
violet whose origin was a violet bulb on the board of an
instrument panel in the wall, which controlled the steel cover
over the exhaust pit. And there was a whisper of emerald
green from the shaded light over a plain deal table at which
a man sat and wrote down figures as they were called to him
from the group gathered directly beneath the Moonraker’s
tail.</p>

<p class="pindent">Gazing up this pastel column, so incredibly slim and graceful,
it seemed unthinkable that anything so delicate could
withstand the pressures which it had been designed to meet
on Friday—the howling stream of the most powerful controlled
explosion that had ever been attempted; the impact
of the sound barrier; the unknown pressures of the atmosphere
at 15,000 miles an hour; the terrible shock as it plunged
back from a thousand miles up and hit the atmospheric envelope
of the earth.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax seemed to read his thoughts. He turned to Bond. “It
will be like committing murder,” he said. Then surprisingly,
he burst into a braying laugh. “Walter,” he called to the
group of men. “Come here.” Walter detached himself and
came over. “Walter, I was saying to our friend the Commander
that when we fire the Moonraker it will be like committing
murder.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was not surprised to see a look of puzzled incredulity
come over the Doctor’s face.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax said irritably, “Child murder. Murder of our child,”
he gestured at the rocket. “Wake up. Wake up. What’s the
matter with you?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Walter’s face cleared. Frostily he beamed his appreciation
of the simile. “Murder. Yes, that is good. Ha! ha! And now,
Sir Hugo. The graphite slats in the exhaust vent. The Ministry
is quite happy about their melting-point? They do not
feel that . . .” Still talking, Walter led Drax under the tail of
the rocket. Bond followed.</p>

<p class="pindent">The faces of the ten men were turned towards them as they
came up. Drax introduced him with a wave of the hand.
“Commander Bond, our new security officer,” he said briefly.</p>

<p class="pindent">The group eyed Bond in silence. There was no move to
greet him and the ten pairs of eyes were incurious.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Now then, what’s all this fuss about the graphite? . . .”
The group closed round Drax and Walter. Bond was left
standing alone.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was not surprised by the coolness of his reception. He
would have regarded the intrusion of an amateur into the
secrets of his own department with much the same indifference
mixed with resentment. And he sympathized with these
hand-picked technicians who had lived for months among
the highest realms of astronautics, and were now on the
threshold of the final arbitration. And yet, he reminded himself,
the innocent among them must know that Bond had his
own duty to perform, his own vital part in this project.
Supposing one pair of those uncommunicative eyes concealed
a man within a man, an enemy, perhaps at this very
moment exulting in his knowledge that the graphite which
Walter seemed to mistrust was indeed under-strength. It was
true that they had the look of a well-knit team, almost of a
brotherhood, as they stood round Drax and Walter, hanging
on their words, their eyes intent on the mouths of the two
men. But was part of one brain moving within the privacy of
some secret orbit, ticking off its hidden calculus like the
stealthy mechanism of an infernal machine?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond moved casually up and down the triangle made by
the three points of the fins as they rested in their rubber-lined
cavities in the steel floor, interesting himself in whatever met
his eyes, but every now and then focusing on the group of men
from a new angle.</p>

<p class="pindent">With the exception of Drax they all wore the same tight
nylon overalls fastened with plastic zips. There was nowhere
a hint of metal and none wore spectacles. As in the case of
Walter and Krebs their heads were close-shaved, presumably,
Bond would have thought, to prevent a loose hair falling into
the mechanism. And yet, and this struck Bond as a most
bizarre characteristic of the team, each man sported a luxuriant
moustache to whose culture it was clear that a great deal
of attention had been devoted. They were in all shapes and
tints: fair or mousy or dark; handlebar, walrus, Kaiser,
Hitler—each face bore its own hairy badge amongst which
the rank, reddish growth of Drax’s facial hair blazed like the
official stamp of their paramount chief.</p>

<p class="pindent">Why, wondered Bond, should every man on the site wear
a moustache? He had never liked the things, but combined
with these shaven heads, there was something positively
obscene about this crop of hairy tufts. It would have been
just bearable if they had all been cut to the same pattern, but
this range of individual fashions, this riot of personalized
growth, had something particularly horrible about it against
the background of naked round heads.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was nothing else to notice; the men were of average
height and they were all on the slim side—tailored, Bond
supposed, more or less to the requirements of their work.
Agility would be needed on the gantries, and compactness for
manoeuvring through the access doors and around the tiny
compartments in the rocket. Their hands looked relaxed and
spotlessly clean, and their feet in the felt slippers were
motionless with concentration. He never once caught any of
them glancing in his direction and, as for penetrating their
minds or weighing up their loyalties, he admitted to himself
that the task of unmasking the thoughts of fifty of these
robot-like Germans in three days was quite hopeless. Then he
remembered. It was fifty no longer. Only forty-nine. One of
these robots had blown his top (apt expression, reflected
Bond). And what had come out of Bartsch’s secret thoughts?
Lust for a woman and a Heil Hitler. Would he be far wrong,
wondered Bond, if he guessed that, forgetting the Moonraker,
those were also the dominant thoughts inside forty-nine
other heads?</p>

<p class="pindent">“Doctor Walter! That is an order.” Drax’s voice of controlled
anger broke in on Bond’s thoughts as he stood fingering
the sharp leading edge of the tail of one of the Columbite
fins. “Back to work. We have wasted enough time.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The men scattered smartly about their duties and Drax
came up to where Bond was standing, leaving Walter hanging
about indecisively beneath the exhaust vent of the rocket.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax’s face was thunderous. “Damn fool. Always seeing
trouble,” he muttered. And then abruptly, as if he wanted to
clear his deputy out of his mind, “Come along to my office.
Show you the flight plan. Then we’ll go off to bed.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond followed him across the floor. Drax turned a small
handle flush with the steel wall and a narrow door opened
with a soft hiss. Three feet inside there was another steel door
and Bond noticed that they were both edged with rubber.
Air-lock. Before closing the outer door Drax paused on the
threshold and pointed along the circular wall to a number of
similar inconspicuous flat knobs in the wall. “Workshops,” he
said. “Electricians, generators, fuelling control, washrooms,
stores.” He pointed to the adjoining door. “My secretary’s
room.” He closed the outer door before he opened the second
and walked into his office and shut the inner door behind
Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a severe room painted pale grey, containing a broad
desk and several chairs of tubular metal and dark blue canvas.
The floor was carpeted in grey. There were two green
filing cabinets and a large metal radio set. A half-open door
showed part of a tiled bathroom. The desk faced a wide blank
wall which seemed to be made of opaque glass. Drax walked
up to the walls and snapped down two switches on its extreme
right. The whole wall lit up and Bond was faced with
two maps each about six feet square traced on the back of the
glass.</p>

<p class="pindent">The left-hand map showed the eastern quarter of England
from Portsmouth to Hull and the adjoining waters from
Latitude 50 to 55. From the red dot near Dover which was
the site of the Moonraker, arcs showing the range in ten-mile
intervals had been drawn up the map. At a point eighty miles
from the site, between the Friesian Islands and Hull, there
was a red diamond in the middle of the ocean.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax waved towards the dense mathematical tables and
columns of compass readings which filled the right-hand
side of the map. “Wind velocities, atmospheric pressure,
ready-reckoner for the gyro settings,” he said. “All worked
out using the rocket’s velocity and range as constants. We
get the weather every day from the Air Ministry and readings
from the upper atmosphere every time the RAF jet can
get up there. When he’s at maximum altitude he releases
helium balloons that can get up still further. The earth’s
atmosphere reaches about fifty miles up. After twenty there’s
hardly any density to affect the Moonraker. It’ll coast up
almost in a vacuum. Getting through the first twenty miles is
the problem. The gravity pull’s another worry. Walter can
explain all those things if you’re interested. There’ll be continuous
weather reports during the last few hours on Friday.
And we’ll set the gyros just before the take-off. For the time
being, Miss Brand gets together the data every morning and
keeps a table of gyro settings in case they’re wanted.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax pointed at the second of the two maps. This was
a diagram of the rocket’s flight ellipse from firing point to
target. There were more columns of figures. “Speed of the
earth and its effect on the rocket’s trajectory,” explained
Drax. “The earth will be turning to the east while the rocket’s
in flight. That factor has to be married in with the figures
on the other map. Complicated business. Fortunately you
don’t have to understand it. Leave it to Miss Brand. Now
then,” he switched off the lights and the wall went blank,
“any particular questions about your job? Don’t think
there’ll be much for you to do. You can see that the place is
already riddled with security. The Ministry’s insisted on it
from the beginning.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Everything looks all right,” said Bond. He examined
Drax’s face. The good eye was looking at him sharply. Bond
paused. “Do you think there was anything between your
secretary and Major Tallon?” he asked. It was an obvious
question and he might just as well ask it now.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Could have been,” said Drax easily. “Attractive girl. They
were thrown together a lot down here. At any rate she seems
to have got under Bartsch’s skin.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I hear Bartsch saluted and shouted ‘Heil Hitler’ before
he put the gun in his mouth,” said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">“So they tell me,” said Drax evenly. “What of it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Why do all the men wear moustaches?” asked Bond,
ignoring Drax’s question. Again he had the impression that
his question had nettled the other man.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax gave one of his short barking laughs. “My idea,” he
said. “They’re difficult to recognize in those white overalls
and with their heads shaved. So I told them all to grow
moustaches. The thing’s become quite a fetish. Like in the
RAF during the war. See anything wrong with it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course not,” said Bond. “Rather startling at first. I
would have thought that large numbers on their suits with a
different colour for each shift would have been more effective.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well,” said Drax, turning away towards the door as if to
end the conversation, “I decided on moustaches.”</p>
