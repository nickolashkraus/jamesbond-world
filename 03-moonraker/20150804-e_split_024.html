<p class="pindent">“My real name,” said Drax, addressing himself to Bond,
“is Graf Hugo von der Drache. My mother was English
and because of her I was educated in England until I was
twelve. Then I could stand this filthy country no longer and
I completed my education in Berlin and Leipzig.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond could imagine that the hulking bully with the ogre’s
teeth had not been very welcome at an English private school.
And being a foreign count with a mouthful of names would
not have helped much.</p>

<p class="pindent">“When I was twenty,” Drax’s eyes glowed reminiscently,
“I went to work in the family business. It was a subsidiary
of the great steel combine <span class="it">Rheinmetal Börsig</span>. Never heard
of it, I suppose. Well, if you’d been hit by an 88 mm. shell
during the war it would probably have been one of theirs.
Our subsidiary were experts in special steels and I learned all
about them and a lot about the aircraft industry. Our most
exacting customers. That’s when I first heard about Columbite.
Worth diamonds in those days. Then I joined the party
and almost immediately we were at war. A wonderful time.
I was twenty-eight and a lieutenant in the 140th Panzer
Regiment. And we ran through the British Army in France
like a knife through butter. Intoxicating.”</p>

<p class="pindent">For a moment Drax puffed luxuriously at his cigar and
Bond guessed that he was seeing the burning villages of
Belgium in the smoke.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Those were great days, my dear Bond.” Drax reached
out a long arm and tapped the ash of his cigar off on to the
floor. “But then I was picked out for the Brandenburg Division
and I had to leave the girls and the champagne and go
back to Germany and start training for the big water-jump
to England. My English was needed in the Division. We were
all going to be in English uniforms. It would have been fun,
but the damned generals said it couldn’t be done and I was
transferred to the Foreign Intelligence Service of the SS. The
RSHA it was called, and SS <span class="it">Obergruppenführer</span> Kaltenbrunner
had just taken over the command after Heydrich
was assassinated in ’42. He was a good man and I was under
the direct orders of a still better one, <span class="it">Obersturmbannführer</span>,”
he rolled out the delicious title with relish, “Otto Skorzeny.
His job in the RSHA was terrorism and sabotage. A pleasant
interlude, my dear Bond, during which I was able to bring
many an Englishman to book which,” Drax beamed coldly at
Bond, “gave me much pleasure. But then,” Drax’s fist crashed
down on the desk, “Hitler was betrayed again by those
swinish generals and the English and Americans were
allowed to land in France.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Too bad,” said Bond drily.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, my dear Bond, it was indeed too bad.” Drax chose to
ignore the irony. “But for me it was the high-spot of the
whole war. Skorzeny turned all his saboteurs and terrorists
into <span class="it">SS Jagdverbände</span> for use behind the enemy lines. Each
<span class="it">Jagdverband</span> was divided into <span class="it">Streifkorps</span> and then into
<span class="it">Kommandos</span>, each carrying the names of its commanding
officer. With the rank of <span class="it">Oberleutnant</span>,” Drax swelled
visibly, “at the head of <span class="it">Kommando</span> ‘Drache’ I went right
through the American lines with the famous 150 Panzer
Brigade in the Ardennes break-through in December ’44.
No doubt you will remember the effect of this Brigade in its
American uniforms and with its captured American tanks
and vehicles. <span class="it">Kolossal!</span> When the Brigade had to withdraw
I stayed where I was and went to ground in the Forests of
Ardennes, fifty miles behind the Allied lines. There were
twenty of us, ten good men and ten Hitlerjugend Werewolves.
In their teens, but good lads all of them. And, by a
coincidence, in charge of them was a young man called
Krebs who turned out to have certain gifts which qualified
him for the post of executioner and ‘persuader’ to our merry
little band.” Drax chuckled pleasantly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond licked his lips as he remembered the crack Krebs’s
head had made against the dressing-table. Had he kicked
him as hard as he possibly could? Yes, his memory reassured
him, with every ounce of strength he could put into his shoe.</p>

<p class="pindent">“We stayed in those woods for six months,” continued
Drax proudly, “and all the time we reported back to the
Fatherland by radio. The location vans never spotted us.
Then one day disaster came.” Drax shook his head at the
memory. “There was a big farmhouse a mile away from our
hideout in the forest. A lot of Nissen huts had been built
round it and it was used as a rear headquarters for some sort
of liaison group. English and Americans. A hopeless place. No
discipline, no security, and full of hangers-on and shirkers
from all over the place. We had kept an eye on it for some
time and one day I decided to blow it up. It was a simple
plan. In the evening, two of my men, one in American
uniform and one in British, were to drive up in a captured
scout car containing two tons of explosive. There was a car
park—no sentries of course—near the mess hall and they
were to run the car in as close to the mess hall as possible,
time the fuse for the seven o’clock dinner hour, and then get
away. All quite easy and I went off that morning on my own
business and left the job to my second in command. I was
dressed in the uniform of your Signal Corps and I set off on
a captured British motor-cycle to shoot a dispatch rider from
the same unit who made a daily run along a near-by road.
Sure enough he came along dead on time and I went after
him out of a side road. I caught up with him,” said Drax
conversationally, “and shot him in the back, took his papers
and put him on top of his machine in the woods and set fire
to him.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax saw the fury in Bond’s eyes and held up his hand.
“Not very sporting? My dear chap, the man was already
dead. However, to continue. I went on my way and then
what should happen? One of our own planes coming back
from a reconnaissance came after me down the road with his
cannon. One of our own planes! Blasted me right off the
road. God knows how long I lay in the ditch. Some time in
the afternoon I came to for a bit and had the sense to hide
my cap and jacket and the dispatches. In the hedge. They’re
probably still there. I must go and collect them one day.
Interesting souvenirs. Then I set fire to the remains of the
motor-cycle and I must have fainted again because the next
thing I knew I had been picked up by a British vehicle and
we were driving into that damned liaison headquarters!
Believe it or not! And there was the scout car, right up alongside
the mess hall! It was too much for me. I was full of shell
splinters and my leg was broken. Well, I fainted and when I
came round there was half the hospital on top of me and I
only had half a face.” He put up his hand and stroked the
shiny skin on his left temple and cheek. “After that it was just
a question of acting a part. They had no idea who I was. The
car that had picked me up had gone or been blown to pieces.
I was just an Englishman in an English shirt and trousers
who was nearly dead.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax paused and took out another cigar and lit it. There
was silence in the room save for the soft diminished roar of
the blowtorch. Its threatening voice was quieter. Pressure
running out, reflected Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">He turned his head and looked at Gala. For the first time
he saw the ugly bruise behind her left ear. He gave her a
smile of encouragement and she smiled wryly back.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax spoke through the cigar smoke: “There is not much
more to tell,” he said. “During the year that I was being
pushed from one hospital to the next I made my plans down
to the smallest detail. They consisted quite simply of revenge
on England for what she had done to me and to my country.
It gradually became an obsession, I admit it. Every day
during the year of the rape and destruction of my country,
my hatred and scorn for the English grew more bitter.” The
veins on Drax’s face started to swell and suddenly he
pounded on the desk and shouted across at them, looking
with bulging eyes from one to the other. “I loathe and despise
you all. You swine! Useless, idle, decadent fools, hiding behind
your bloody white cliffs while other people fight your
battles. Too weak to defend your colonies, toadying to
America with your hats in your hands. Stinking snobs who’ll
do anything for money. Hah!” he was triumphant. “I knew
that all I needed was money and the façade of a gentleman.
Gentleman! <span class="it">Pfui Teufel!</span> To me a gentleman is just someone
I can take advantage of. Those bloody fools in Blades for
instance. Moneyed oafs. For months I took thousands of
pounds off them, swindled them right under their noses until
you came along and upset the apple-cart.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax’s eyes narrowed. “What put you on to the cigarette
case?” he asked sharply.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shrugged his shoulders. “My eyes,” he said indifferently.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Ah well,” said Drax, “perhaps I was a bit careless that
night. But where was I? Ah yes, in hospital. And the good
doctors were so anxious to help me find out who I really
was.” He let out a roar of laughter. “It was easy. So easy.”
His eyes became cunning. “From the identities they offered
me so helpfully I came upon the name of Hugo Drax. What
a coincidence! From Drache to Drax! Tentatively I thought
it <span class="it">might</span> be me. They were very proud. Yes, they said, <span class="it">of
course</span> it is you. The doctors triumphantly forced me into his
shoes. I put them on and walked out of the hospital in them
and I walked round London looking for someone to kill and
rob. And one day, in a little office high above Piccadilly, a
Jewish moneylender.” (Now Drax was talking faster. The
words poured excitedly from his lips. Bond watched a fleck
of foam gather at one corner of his mouth and grow.) “Ha.
It was easy. Crack on his bald skull. £15,000 in the safe. And
then away and out of the country, Tangier—where you
could do anything, buy anything, fix anything. Columbite.
Rarer than platinum and everyone would want it. The Jet
Age. I knew about these things. I had not forgotten my own
profession. And then by God I worked. For five years I lived
for money. And I was brave as a lion. I took terrible risks.
And suddenly the first million was there. Then the second.
Then the fifth. Then the twentieth. I came back to England.
I spent a million of it and London was in my pocket. And
then I went back to Germany. I found Krebs. I found fifty
of them. Loyal Germans. Brilliant technicians. All living
under false names like so many others of my old comrades.
I gave them their orders and they waited, peacefully, innocently.
And where was I?” Drax stared across at Bond, his
eyes wide. “I was in Moscow. Moscow! A man with Columbite
to sell can go anywhere. I got to the right people. They
listened to my plans. They gave me Walter, the new genius
of their guided missile station at Peenemunde, and the good
Russians started to build the atomic warhead,” he gestured
up to the ceiling, “that is now waiting up there. Then I came
back to London.” A pause. “The Coronation. My letter to
the Palace. Triumph. Hooray for Drax,” he burst into a roar
of laughter. “England at my feet. Every bloody fool in the
country! And then my men come over and we start. Under
the very skirts of Britannia. On top of her famous cliffs. We
work like devils. We built a jetty into your English Channel.
For supplies! For supplies from my good friends the Russians
that came in dead on time last Monday night. But then
Tallon had to hear something. The old fool. He talks to the
Ministry. But Krebs is listening. There were fifty volunteers
to kill the man. Lots are drawn and Bartsch dies a hero’s
death.” Drax paused. “He will not be forgotten.” Then he
went on. “The new warhead is hoisted into place. It fits. A
perfect piece of design. The same weight. Everything perfect,
and the old one, the tin can full of the Ministry’s cherished
instruments, is now in Stettin—behind the Iron Curtain.
And the faithful submarine is on her way back here and will
soon,” he looked at his watch, “be creeping under the waters
of the English Channel to take us all off at one minute past
midday tomorrow.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax wiped his mouth with the back of his hand and lay
back in his chair gazing up at the ceiling, his eyes full of
visions. Suddenly he chuckled and squinted quizzically down
his nose at Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">“And do you know what we shall do first when we go on
board? We shall shave off those famous moustaches you were
so interested in. You smelt a mouse, my dear Bond, where
you ought to have smelt a rat. Those shaven heads and those
moustaches we all cultivated so assiduously. Just a precaution,
my dear fellow. Try shaving your own head and
growing a big black moustache. Even your mother wouldn’t
recognize you. It’s the combination that counts. Just a tiny
refinement. Precision, my dear fellow. Precision in every
detail. That has been my watchword.” He chuckled fatly and
puffed away at his cigar.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly he looked sharply, suspiciously up at Bond.
“Well. Say something. Don’t sit there like a dummy. What do
you think of my story? Don’t you think it’s extraordinary, remarkable?
For one man to have done all that? Come on,
come on.” A hand came up to his mouth and he started
tearing furiously at his nails. Then it was plunged back into
his pocket and his eyes became cruel and cold. “Or do you
want me to have to send for Krebs,” he made a gesture towards
the house telephone on his desk. “The Persuader. Poor
Krebs. He’s like a child who’s had his toys taken away from
him. Or perhaps Walter. He would give you both something
to remember. There’s no softness in that one. Well?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes,” said Bond. He looked levelly at the great red face
across the desk. “It’s a remarkable case-history. Galloping
paranoia. Delusions of jealousy and persecution. Megalomaniac
hatred and desire for revenge. Curiously enough,”
he went on conversationally, “it may have something to do
with your teeth. Diastema, they call it. Comes from sucking
your thumb when you’re a child. Yes. I expect that’s what
the psychologists will say when they get you into the lunatic
asylum. ‘Ogre’s teeth.’ Being bullied at school and so on.
Extraordinary the effect it has on a child. Then Nazism
helped to fan the flames and then came the crack on your
ugly head. The crack you engineered yourself. I expect that
settled it. From then on you were really mad. Same sort of
thing as people who think they’re God. Extraordinary what
tenacity they have. Absolute fanatics. You’re almost a genius.
Lombroso would have been delighted with you. As it is
you’re just a mad dog that’ll have to be shot. Or else you’ll
commit suicide. Paranoiacs generally do. Too bad. Sad
business.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond paused and put all the scorn he could summon into
his voice. “And now let’s get on with this farce, you great
hairy-faced lunatic.”</p>

<p class="pindent">It worked. With every word Drax’s face had become more
contorted with rage, his eyes were red with it, the sweat of
fury was dripping off his jowls on to his shirt, the lips were
drawn back from the gaping teeth and a string of saliva had
crept out of his mouth and was hanging down from his chin.
Now, at the last private-school insult that must have awoken
God knows what stinging memories, he leapt up from his
chair and lunged round the desk at Bond, his hairy fists
flailing.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gritted his teeth and took it.</p>

<p class="pindent">When Drax had twice had to pick the chair up with Bond
in it, the tornado of rage suddenly passed. He took out his
silk handkerchief and wiped his face and hands. Then he
walked quietly to the door and spoke across the lolling head
of Bond to the girl.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I don’t think you two will give me any more trouble,” he
said, and his voice was quite calm and certain. “Krebs never
makes a mistake with his knots.” He gesticulated towards the
bloody figure in the other chair. “When he wakes up,” he
said, “you can tell him that these doors will open once more,
just before noon tomorrow. A few minutes later there will be
nothing left of either of you. Not even,” he added as he
wrenched open the inner door, “the stoppings in your
teeth.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The outer door slammed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond slowly raised his head and grinned painfully at the
girl with his bloodstained lips.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Had to get him mad,” he said with difficulty. “Didn’t
want to give him time to think. Had to work up a brainstorm.”
Gala looked at him uncomprehendingly, her eyes
wide at the terrible mask of his face.</p>

<p class="pindent">“ ’S’all right,” said Bond thickly. “Don’t worry. London’s
okay. Got a plan.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Over on the desk the blowtorch gave a quiet ‘plop’ and
went out.</p>
