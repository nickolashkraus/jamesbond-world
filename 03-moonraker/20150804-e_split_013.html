<p class="pindent">Five minutes later Bond was showing his Ministry pass to
the uniformed guard on duty at the gate in the high wire
fence.</p>

<p class="pindent">The RAF sergeant handed it back to him and saluted.
“Sir Hugo’s expecting you, sir. It’s the big house up in the
woods there.” He pointed to some lights a hundred yards
further on towards the cliffs.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond heard him telephoning to the next guard point. He
motored slowly along the new tarmac road that had been
laid across the fields behind Kingsdown. He could hear the
distant boom of the sea at the foot of the tall cliffs and from
somewhere close at hand there was a high-pitched whine
of machinery which grew louder as he approached the trees.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was stopped again by a plain-clothes guard at a second
wire fence through which a five-bar gate gave access to the
interior of the wood, and as he was waved through he heard
the distant baying of police dogs which suggested some form
of night patrol. All these precautions seemed efficient. Bond
decided that he wouldn’t have to worry himself with problems
of external security.</p>

<p class="pindent">Once through the trees the car was running over a flat
concrete apron the limits of which, in the bad light, were out
of range even of the huge twin beams of his Marchal headlamps.
A hundred yards to his left, on the edge of the trees,
there were the lights of a large house half-hidden behind a
wall six feet thick, that rose straight up off the surface of the
concrete almost to the height of the house. Bond slowed the
car down to walking pace and turned its bonnet away from
the house towards the sea and towards a dark shape that
suddenly glinted white in the revolving beams of the South
Goodwin Lightship far out in the Channel. His lights cut a
path down the apron to where, almost on the edge of the cliff
and at least half a mile away, a squat dome surged up about
fifty feet out of the concrete. It looked like the top of an
observatory and Bond could distinguish the flange of a joint
running east and west across the surface of the dome.</p>

<p class="pindent">He turned the car back and slowly ran it up between what
he now assumed to be a blast-wall and the front of the house.
As he pulled up outside the house the door opened and a
manservant in a white jacket came out. He smartly opened
the door of the car.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Good evening, sir. This way please.”</p>

<p class="pindent">He spoke woodenly and with a trace of accent. Bond
followed him into the house and across a comfortable hall to
a door on which the butler knocked.</p>

<p class="pindent">“In.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled to himself at the harsh tone of the well-remembered
voice and at the note of command in the single
monosyllable.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the far end of the long, bright, chintzy living-room Drax
was standing with his back to an empty grate, a huge figure
in a plum-coloured velvet smoking-jacket that clashed with
the reddish hair on his face. There were three other people
standing near him, two men and a woman.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Ah, my dear fellow,” said Drax boisterously, striding
forward to meet him and shaking him cordially by the hand.
“So we meet again. And so soon. Didn’t realize you were a
ruddy spy for my Ministry or I’d have been more careful
about playing cards against you. Spent that money yet?” he
asked, leading him towards the fire.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Not yet,” smiled Bond. “Haven’t seen the colour of it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course. Settlement on Saturday. Probably get the
cheque just in time to celebrate our little firework display,
what? Now let’s see.” He led Bond up to the woman. “This
is my secretary, Miss Brand.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked into a pair of very level blue eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Good evening.” He gave her a friendly smile.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was no answering smile in the eyes which looked
calmly into his. No answering pressure of her hand. “How
do you do,” she said indifferently, almost, Bond sensed, with
hostility.</p>

<p class="pindent">It crossed Bond’s mind that she had been well-chosen.
Another Loelia Ponsonby. Reserved, efficient, loyal, virginal.
Thank heavens, he thought. A professional.</p>

<p class="pindent">“My right-hand man, Dr Walter.” The thin elderly man
with a pair of angry eyes under the shock of black hair seemed
not to notice Bond’s outstretched hand. He sprang to attention
and gave a quick nod of the head. “Valter,” said the
thin mouth above the black imperial, correcting Drax’s pronunciation.</p>

<p class="pindent">“And my—what shall I say—my dogsbody. What you
might call my ADC, Willy Krebs.” There was the touch of
a slightly damp hand. “Ferry pleased to meet you,” said an
ingratiating voice and Bond looked into a pale round unhealthy
face now split in a stage smile which died almost as
Bond noticed it. Bond looked into his eyes. They were like
two restless black buttons and they twisted away from Bond’s
gaze.</p>

<p class="pindent">Both men wore spotless white overalls with plastic zip
fasteners at the sleeves and ankles and down the back. Their
hair was close-cropped so that the skin shone through and
they would have looked like people from another planet but
for the untidy black moustache and imperial of Dr Walter
and the pale wispy moustache of Krebs. They were both
caricatures—a mad scientist and a youthful version of Peter
Lorre.</p>

<p class="pindent">The colourful ogreish figure of Drax was a pleasant contrast
in this chilly company and Bond was grateful to him
for the cheerful roughness of his welcome and for his apparent
wish to bury the hatchet and make the best of his new
security officer.</p>

<p class="pindent">Drax was very much the host. He rubbed his hands
together. “Now, Willy,” he said, “how about making one of
your excellent dry Martinis for us? Except, of course, for
the Doctor. Doesn’t drink or smoke,” he explained to Bond,
returning to his place by the mantelpiece. “Hardly breathes.”
He barked out a short laugh. “Thinks of nothing but the
rocket. Do you, my friend?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The Doctor looked stonily in front of him. “You are
pleased to joke,” he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Now, now,” said Drax, as if to a child. “We will go back
to those leading edges later. Everybody’s quite happy about
them except you.” He turned to Bond. “The good Doctor is
always frightening us,” he explained indulgently. “He’s
always having nightmares about something. Now it’s the
leading edges of the fins. They’re already as sharp as razor
blades—hardly any wind resistance at all. And he suddenly
gets it into his head that they’re going to melt. Friction of
the air. Of course everything’s possible, but they’ve been
tested at over 3000 degrees and, as I tell him, if they’re going
to melt then the whole rocket will melt. And that’s just not
going to happen,” he added with a grim smile.</p>

<p class="pindent">Krebs came up with a silver tray with four full glasses and
a frosted shaker. The Martini was excellent and Bond said so.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You are ferry kind,” said Krebs with a smirk of satisfaction.
“Sir Hugo is ferry exacting.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Fill up his glass,” said Drax, “and then perhaps our friend
would like to wash. We dine at eight sharp.”</p>

<p class="pindent">As he spoke there came the muffled wail of a siren and
almost immediately the sound of a body of men running in
strict unison across the concrete apron outside.</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s the first night shift,” explained Drax. “Barracks
are just behind the house. Must be eight o’clock. We do
everything at the double here,” he added with a gleam of
satisfaction in his eye. “Precision. Lot of scientists about,
but we try to run the place like a military establishment.
Willy, look after the Commander. We’ll go ahead. Come
along, my dear.”</p>

<p class="pindent">As Bond followed Krebs to the door through which he had
entered, he saw the other two with Drax in the lead make for
the double doors at the end of the room which had opened
as Drax finished speaking. The manservant in the white coat
stood in the entrance. As Bond went out into the hall it
crossed his mind that Drax would certainly go into the
dining-room ahead of Miss Brand. Forceful personality.
Treated his staff like children. Obviously a born leader.
Where had he got it from? The Army? Or did it grow on
one with millions of money? Bond followed the slug-like
neck of Krebs and wondered.</p>

<p class="pindent">The dinner was excellent. Drax was a genial host and at
his own table his manners were faultless. Most of his conversation
consisted in drawing out Dr Walter for the benefit
of Bond, and it covered a wide range of technical matters
which Drax took pains to explain briefly after each topic
had been exhausted. Bond was impressed by the confidence
with which Drax handled each abstruse problem as it was
raised, and by his immense grasp of detail. A genuine admiration
for the man gradually developed in him and overshadowed
much of his previous dislike. He felt more than
ever inclined to forget the Blades affair now that he was
faced with the other Drax, the creator and inspired leader of
a remarkable enterprise.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat between his host and Miss Brand. He made
several attempts to engage her in conversation. He failed
completely. She answered with polite monosyllables and
would hardly meet his eye. Bond became mildly irritated. He
found her physically very attractive and it annoyed him to
be unable to extract the smallest response. He felt that her
frigid indifference was overacted and that security would
have been far better met with an easy, friendly approach
instead of this exaggerated reticence. He felt a strong urge
to give her a sharp kick on the ankle. The idea entertained
him and he found himself observing her with a fresh eye—as
a girl and not as an official colleague. As a start, and under
cover of a long argument between Drax and Walter, in which
she was required to join, about the collation of weather reports
from the Air Ministry and from Europe, he began to
add up his impressions of her.</p>

<p class="pindent">She was far more attractive than her photograph had suggested
and it was difficult to see traces of the severe competence
of a policewoman in the seductive girl beside him.
There was authority in the definite line of the profile, but
the long black eyelashes over the dark blue eyes and the
rather wide mouth might have been painted by Marie Laurencin.
Yet the lips were too full for a Laurencin and the
dark brown hair that curved inwards at the base of the neck
was of a different fashion. There was a hint of northern
blood in the high cheekbones and in the very slight upward
slant of the eyes, but the warmth of her skin was entirely
English. There was too much poise and authority in her
gestures and in the carriage of her head for her to be a very
convincing portrait of a secretary. In fact she seemed almost
a member of Drax’s team, and Bond noticed that the men
listened with attention as she answered Drax’s questions.</p>

<p class="pindent">Her rather severe evening dress was in charcoal black grosgrain
with full sleeves that came below the elbow. The wrapover
bodice just showed the swell of her breasts, which were
as splendid as Bond had guessed from the measurements on
her record sheet. At the point of the vee there was a bright
blue cameo brooch, a Tassie intaglio, Bond guessed, cheap
but imaginative. She wore no other jewellery except a half-hoop
of small diamonds on her engagement finger. Apart
from the warm rouge on her lips, she wore no make-up and
her nails were square-cut with a natural polish.</p>

<p class="pindent">Altogether, Bond decided, she was a very lovely girl and
beneath her reserve, a very passionate one. And, he reflected,
she might be a policewoman and an expert at jujitsu, but she
also had a mole on her right breast.</p>

<p class="pindent">With this comforting thought Bond turned the whole of
his attention to the conversation between Drax and Walter
and made no further attempts to make friends with the girl.</p>

<p class="pindent">Dinner ended at nine. “Now we will go over and introduce
you to the Moonraker,” said Drax, rising abruptly from the
table. “Walter will accompany us. He has much to do. Come
along, my dear Bond.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Without a word to Krebs or the girl he strode out of the
room. Bond and Walter followed him.</p>

<p class="pindent">They left the house and walked across the concrete towards
the distant shape on the edge of the cliff. The moon
had risen and in the distance the squat dome shone palely in
its light.</p>

<p class="pindent">A hundred yards from the site Drax stopped. “I will explain
the geography,” he said. “Walter, you go ahead. They
will be waiting for you to have another look at those fins.
Don’t worry about them, my dear fellow. Those people at
High Duty Alloys know what they’re doing. Now,” he turned
to Bond and gestured towards the milk-white dome, “in
there is the Moonraker. What you see is the lid of a wide shaft
that has been cut about forty foot down into the chalk. The
two halves of the dome are opened hydraulically and folded
back flush with that twenty-foot wall. If they were open
now, you would see the nose of the Moonraker just protruding
above the level of the wall. Over there,” he pointed
to a square shape that was almost out of sight in the direction
of Deal, “is the firing point. Concrete blockhouse. Full of
radar tracking gadgets—Doppler velocity radar and flight-path
radar, for instance. Information is fed to them by
twenty telemetering channels in the nose of the rocket.
There’s a big television screen in there too so that you can
watch the behaviour of the rocket inside the shaft after the
pumps have been started. Another television set to follow
the beginning of its climb. Alongside the blockhouse there’s
a hoist down the face of the cliff. Quite a lot of gear has been
brought to the site by sea and then sent up on the hoist.
That whine you hear is from the power house over there,” he
gestured vaguely in the direction of Dover. “The men’s
barracks and the house are protected by the blast-wall, but
when we fire there won’t be anyone within a mile of the site,
except the Ministry experts and the BBC team who are going
to be in the firing point. Hope it’ll stand up to the blast.
Walter says that the site and a lot of the concrete apron will
be melted by the heat. That’s all. Nothing else you need to
know about until we get inside. Come along.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond noted again the abrupt tone of command. He followed
in silence across the moonlit expanse until they came
to the supporting wall of the dome. A naked red bulb glowed
over a steel-plated door in the wall. It illuminated a bold sign
which said in English and German: <span class="sc">MORTAL DANGER. ENTRY
FORBIDDEN WHEN RED LAMP SHOWS. RING AND WAIT.</span></p>

<p class="pindent">Drax pressed the button beneath the notice and there was
the muffled clang of an alarm bell. “Might be somebody
working with oxy-acetylene or doing some other delicate
job,” he explained. “Take his mind off his job for a split
second as somebody comes in and you could have an expensive
mistake. Everybody downs tools when the bell rings and
then starts up again when they see what it is.” Drax stood
away from the door and pointed upwards to a row of four-foot
wide gratings just below the top of the wall. “Ventilator
shafts,” he explained. “Air conditioned inside to 70 degrees.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The door was opened by a man with a truncheon in his
hand and a revolver at his hip. Bond followed Drax through
into a small anteroom. It contained nothing but a bench and
a neat row of felt slippers.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Have to put these on,” said Drax sitting down and kicking
off his shoes. “Might slip up and knock into someone.
Better leave your coat here, too. Seventy degrees is quite
warm.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thanks,” said Bond remembering the Beretta at his armpit.
“As a matter of fact I don’t feel the heat.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Feeling like a visitor to an operating theatre, Bond followed
Drax through a communicating door out on to an iron
catwalk and into a blaze of spotlights that made him automatically
put a hand up to his eyes as he grasped the guardrail
in front of him.</p>

<p class="pindent">When he took his hand away he was greeted by a scene
of such splendour that for several minutes he stood speechless,
his eyes dazzled by the terrible beauty of the greatest
weapon on earth.</p>
