<p class="pindent">On Wednesday morning Bond woke early in the dead
man’s bed.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had slept little. Drax had said nothing on their way
back to the house and had bidden him a curt good-night at
the foot of the stairs. Bond had walked along the carpeted
corridor to where light shone from an open door and had
found his things neatly laid out in a comfortable bedroom.</p>

<p class="pindent">The room was furnished in the same expensive taste as the
ground floor and there were biscuits and a bottle of Vichy
(not a Vichy bottle of tap-water, Bond established) beside
the Heal bed.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were no signs of the previous occupant except a
leather case containing binoculars on the dressing-table and
a metal filing cabinet which was locked. Bond knew about
filing cabinets. He tilted it against the wall, reached underneath,
and found the bottom end of the bar-lock which
protrudes downwards when the top section has been locked.
Upwards pressure released the drawers one by one and he
softly lowered the edge of the cabinet back on to the floor
with the unkind reflection that Major Tallon would not have
survived very long in the Secret Service.</p>

<p class="pindent">The top drawer contained scale maps of the site and its
component buildings and Admiralty Chart No. 1895 of the
Straits of Dover. Bond laid each sheet on the bed and examined
them minutely. There were traces of cigarette ash in
the folds of the Admiralty chart.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond fetched his tool-box—a square leather case that stood
beside the dressing-table. He examined the numbers on the
wheels of the combination lock and, satisfied that they had
not been disturbed, turned them to the code number. The
box was closely fitted with instruments. Bond selected a
fingerprint powder-spray and a large magnifying glass. He
puffed the fine greyish powder foot by foot over the whole
expanse of the chart. A forest of fingerprints showed.</p>

<p class="pindent">By going over these with the magnifying glass he established
that they belonged to two people. He isolated two of
the best sets, took a Leica with a flashbulb attachment out of
the leather case and photographed them. Then he carefully
examined through his glass the two minute furrows in the
paper which the powder had brought to light.</p>

<p class="pindent">These appeared to be two lines drawn out from the coast
to form a cross-bearing in the sea. It was a very narrow bearing,
and both lines seemed to originate from the house where
Bond was. In fact, thought Bond, they might indicate observations
of some object in the sea made from each wing of the
house.</p>

<p class="pindent">The two lines were drawn not with a pencil, but, presumably
to avoid detection, with a stylus which had barely
furrowed the paper.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the point where they met there was the trace of a
question mark, and this point was on the twelve-fathom
line about fifty yards from the cliff on a direct bearing from
the house to the South Goodwin Lightship.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was nothing else to be gathered from the chart.
Bond glanced at his watch. Twenty minutes to one. He heard
distant footsteps in the hall and the click of a light being
extinguished. On an impulse he rose and softly switched off
the lights in his room, leaving only the shaded reading-light
beside the bed.</p>

<p class="pindent">He heard the heavy footsteps of Drax approaching up the
stairs. There was the click of another switch and then silence.
Bond could imagine the great hairy face turned down the
corridor, looking, listening. Then there was a creak and the
sound of a door being softly opened and as softly closed.
Bond waited, visualizing the motions of the man as he prepared
for bed. There was the muffled sound of a window
being thrown open and the distant trumpet of a nose being
blown. Then silence.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gave Drax another five minutes then he went over to
the filing cabinet and softly pulled out the other drawers.
There was nothing in the second and third, but the bottom
one was solid with files arranged under index letters. They
were the dossiers of all the men working on the site. Bond
pulled out the ‘A’ section and went back to the bed and
started to read.</p>

<p class="pindent">In each case the formula was the same: full name, address,
date of birth, description, distinguishing marks, profession
or trade since the war, war record, political record and present
sympathies, criminal record, health, next of kin. Some
of the men had wives and children whose particulars were
noted, and with each dossier there were photographs, full
face and profile, and the fingerprints of both hands.</p>

<p class="pindent">Two hours and ten cigarettes later he had worked through
all of them and had discovered two points of general interest.
First, that every one of the fifty men appeared to have led a
blameless life without a breath of political or criminal odium.
This seemed so unlikely that he decided to refer every single
dossier back to Station D for a thorough recheck at the first
opportunity.</p>

<p class="pindent">The second point was that none of the faces in the photographs
bore a moustache. Despite Drax’s explanations, this
fact raised a second tiny question mark in Bond’s mind.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got up from the bed and locked everything away,
putting the Admiralty Chart and one of the files in his leather
case. He turned the wheels of the combination lock and thrust
the case far under his bed so that it rested directly beneath
his pillow at the inside angle of the wall. Then he quietly
washed and cleaned his teeth in the adjoining bathroom and
eased the window wide open.</p>

<p class="pindent">The moon was still shining: as it must have shone, Bond
thought, when, aroused perhaps by some unusual noise, Tallon
had climbed up to the roof, maybe only a couple of nights
before, and had seen, out at sea, what he had seen. He would
have had his glasses with him and Bond, remembering,
turned back from the window and picked them up. They
were a very powerful German pair, booty perhaps from the
war, and the 7 x 50 on the top plates told Bond that they
were night glasses. And then the careful Tallon must have
walked softly (but not softly enough?) to the other end of
the roof and had raised his glasses again, estimating the distance
from the edge of the cliff to the object in the sea, and
from the object to the Goodwin Lightship. Then he would
have come back the way he had gone and softly re-entered
his room.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond saw Tallon, perhaps for the first time since he had
been in the house, carefully lock the door and walk over to
the filing cabinet and take out the chart which he had hardly
glanced at till then and on it softly mark the lines of his rough
bearing. Perhaps he looked at it for a long while before putting
the minute question mark beside it.</p>

<p class="pindent">And what had the unknown object been? Impossible to
say. A boat? A light? A noise?</p>

<p class="pindent">Whatever it was Tallon had not been supposed to see it.
And somebody had heard him. Somebody had guessed he
had seen it and had waited until Tallon had left his room
next morning. Then that man had come into his room and
had searched it. Probably the chart had revealed nothing,
but there were the night glasses by the window.</p>

<p class="pindent">That had been enough. And that night Tallon had died.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond pulled himself up. He was going too fast, building
up a case on the flimsiest evidence. Bartsch had killed Tallon
and Bartsch was not the man who had heard the noise, the
man who had left fingerprints on the chart, the man whose
dossier Bond had put away in his leather case.</p>

<p class="pindent">That man had been the oily ADC, Krebs, the man with
the neck like a white slug. They were his prints on the chart.
For a quarter of an hour Bond had compared the impressions
on the chart with the prints on Krebs’s dossier. But who said
Krebs had heard a noise or done anything about it if he had?
Well, to begin with, he looked like a natural snooper. He had
the eyes of a petty thief. And those prints of his had definitely
been made on the chart after Tallon had studied it. Krebs’s
fingers overlaid Tallon’s at several points.</p>

<p class="pindent">But how could Krebs possibly be involved, with Drax’s
eye constantly on him? The confidential assistant. But what
about Cicero, the trusted valet of the British Ambassador in
Ankara during the war? The hand in the pocket of the
striped trousers hanging over the back of the chair. The
Ambassador’s keys. The safe. The secrets. This picture looked
very much the same.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shivered. He suddenly realized that he had been
standing for a long time in front of the open windows and
that it was time to get some sleep.</p>

<p class="pindent">Before he got into bed he took his shoulder-holster from
the chair where it hung beside his discarded clothes and
removed the Beretta with the skeleton grip and slipped it
under his pillow. As a defence against whom? Bond didn’t
know, but his intuition told him quite definitely that there
was danger about. The smell of it was insistent although it
was still imprecise and lingered only on the threshold of his
subconscious. In fact he knew his feelings were based on a
number of tiny question-marks which had materialized
during the past twenty-four hours—the riddle of Drax;
Bartsch’s ‘Heil Hitler’; the bizarre moustaches; the fifty
worthy Germans; the chart; the night glasses; Krebs.</p>

<p class="pindent">First he must pass on his suspicions to Vallance. Then
explore the possibilities of Krebs. Then look to the defences
of the Moonraker—the seaward side for instance. And then
get together with this Brand girl and agree on a plan for the
next two days. There wasn’t much time to lose.</p>

<p class="pindent">While he forced sleep to come into his teeming mind, Bond
visualized the figure seven on the dial of a clock and left it to
the hidden cells of his memory to wake him. He wanted to
be out of the house and on the telephone to Vallance as early
as possible. If his actions aroused suspicion he would not be
dismayed. One of his objects was to attract into his orbit the
same forces that had concerned themselves with Tallon, for
of one thing he felt reasonably certain, Major Tallon had
not died because he loved Gala Brand.</p>

<p class="pindent">The extra-sensory alarm clock did not fail him. Punctually
at seven, his mouth dry with too many cigarettes the
night before, he forced himself out of bed and into a cold
bath. He had shaved, gargled with a sharp mouth-wash, and
now, in a battered black and white dogtooth suit, dark blue
Sea Island cotton shirt and black silk knitted tie, he was
walking softly, but not surreptitiously, along the corridor to
the head of the stairs, the square leather case in his left hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">He found the garage at the back of the house and the big
engine of the Bentley answered with the first pressure on the
starter. He motored slowly across the concrete apron beneath
the indifferent gaze of the curtained windows of the house
and pulled up, the engine idling in neutral, at the edge of
the trees. His eyes travelled back to the house and confirmed
his calculation that a man standing on its roof would be able
to see over the top of the blast-wall and get a view of the
edge of the cliff and of the sea beyond.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was no sign of life round the domed emplacement
of the Moonraker, and the concrete, already beginning to
shimmer in the early morning sun, stretched emptily away
towards Deal. It looked like a newly laid aerodrome or rather,
he thought, with its three disparate concrete ‘things’, the beehive
dome, the flat-iron blast-wall, and the distant cube of
the firing point, each casting black pools of shadow towards
him in the early sun, like a Dali desert landscape in which
three <span class="it">objets trouvés</span> reposed at carefully calculated random.</p>

<p class="pindent">Out at sea, in the early mist that promised a hot day, the
South Goodwin Lightship could just be seen, a dim red
barque married for ever to the same compass point and condemned,
like a property ship on the stage of Drury Lane, to
watch the diorama of the waves and clouds sail busily into
the wings while, without papers or passengers or cargo, it lay
anchored for ever to the departure point which was also its
destination.</p>

<p class="pindent">At thirty seconds’ interval it blared its sad complaint into
the mist, a long double trumpet note on a falling cadence. A
siren song, Bond reflected, to repel instead of to seduce. He
wondered how the seven men of its crew were now supporting
the noise as they munched their pork and beans. Did they
flinch as it punctuated the Housewife’s Choice coming at full
strength from the radio in the narrow mess? But a secure
life,<a id="r1_2"></a><a href="#f1_2" class="calibre5"><sup class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">[1]</span></sup></a> Bond decided, although anchored to the gates of a
graveyard.</p>

<p class="pindent">He made a mental note to find out if those seven men had
seen or heard the thing that Tallon had marked on the chart,
then he drove quickly on through the guard posts.</p>

<p class="pindent">In Dover, Bond pulled up at the Café Royal, a modest
little restaurant with a modest kitchen but capable, as he
knew of old, of turning out excellent fish and egg dishes.
The Italian-Swiss mother and son who ran it welcomed him
as an old friend and he asked for a plate of scrambled eggs
and bacon and plenty of coffee to be ready in half an hour.
Then he drove on to the police station and put a call in to
Vallance through the Scotland Yard switchboard. Vallance
was at home having breakfast. He listened without comment
to Bond’s guarded talk, but he expressed surprise that Bond
had not had an opportunity to have a talk with Gala Brand.
“She’s a bright girl, that,” he said. “If Mr K. is up to something
she’s sure to have an idea what it is. And if T. heard a
noise on Sunday night, she may have heard it too. Though
I’ll admit she’s said nothing about it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said nothing about the reception he had had from
Vallance’s agent. “Going to talk to her this morning,” he
said, “and I’ll send up the chart and the Leica film for you
to have a look at. I’ll give them to the Inspector. Perhaps
one of the road patrols could bring them up. By the way,
where did T. telephone from when he rang up his employer
on Monday?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’ll have the call traced and let you know,” said Vallance.
“And I’ll have Trinity House ask the South Goodwins and
the Coastguards if they can help. Anything else?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No,” said Bond. The line went through too many switchboards.
Perhaps if it had been M. he would have hinted
more. It seemed ridiculous to talk to Vallance about moustaches
and the creep of danger he had felt the night before
and which the daylight had dissipated. These policemen
wanted hard facts. They were better, he decided, at solving
crimes than at anticipating them. “No. That’s all.” He hung
up.</p>

<p class="pindent">He felt more cheerful after an excellent breakfast. He read
the <span class="it">Express</span> and <span class="it">The Times</span> and found a bare report of the
inquest on Tallon. The <span class="it">Express</span> had made a big play with the
girl’s photograph and he was amused to see what a neutral
likeness Vallance had managed to produce. He decided that
he must try and work with her. He would take her completely
into his confidence whether she was receptive or not. Perhaps
she also had her suspicions and intuitions which were
so vague that she was keeping them to herself.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond drove back fast to the house. It was just nine o’clock
and as he came through the trees on to the concrete there
was the wail of a siren and from the woods behind the house
a double file of twelve men appeared running, in purposeful
unison, towards the launching dome. They marked time
while one of their number rang the bell, then the door opened
and they filed through and out of sight.</p>

<p class="pindent">Scratch a German and you find precision, thought Bond.</p>
