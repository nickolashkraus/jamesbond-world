<p class="line8"><span class="sc">Bond dropped his</span> lighted cigarette and left it to smoulder
on the carpet. His whole body tensed. He said, “I suppose
you know you’re both mad as hatters.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“So was Frederick the Great, so was Nietzsche, so was
Van Gogh. We are in good, in illustrious company, Mister
Bond. On the other hand, what are you? You are a common
thug, a blunt instrument wielded by dolts in high
places. Having done what you are told to do, out of some
mistaken idea of duty or patriotism, you satisfy your
brutish instincts with alcohol, nicotine, and sex while waiting
to be dispatched on the next misbegotten foray. Twice
before, your chief has sent you to do battle with me, Mister
Bond, and by a combination of luck and brute force, you
were successful in destroying two projects of my genius.
You and your government would categorize these projects
as crimes against humanity, and various authorities still
seek to bring me to book for them. But try and summon
such wits as you possess, Mister Bond, and see them in a
realistic light and in the higher realm of my own thinking.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Blofeld was a big man, perhaps six foot three, and
powerfully built. He placed the tip of the <span class="it">samurai</span> sword,
which has almost the blade of the scimitar, between his
straddled feet and rested his sinewy hands on its boss.
Looking up at him from across the room, Bond had to
admit that there was something larger than life in the
looming imperious figure, in the hypnotically direct stare
of the eyes, in the tall white brow, in the cruel downward
twist of the thin lips. The square-cut, heavily draped
kimono, designed to give the illusion of bulk to a race
of smallish men, made something huge out of the towering
figure, and the golden dragon embroidery, so easily to be
derided as a childish fantasy, crawled menacingly across the
black silk and seemed to spit real fire from over the left
breast. Blofeld had paused in his harangue. Waiting for him
to continue, Bond took the measure of his enemy. He knew
what would be coming—justification. It was always so.
When they thought they had got you where they wanted
you, when they knew they were decisively on top, before
the knock-out, even to an audience on the threshold of
extinction, it was pleasant, reassuring to the executioner,
to deliver his apologia—purge the sin he was about to
commit. Blofeld, his hands relaxed on the boss of his
sword, continued. The tone of his voice was reasonable,
self-assured, quietly expository.</p>

<p class="pindent">He said, “Now, Mister Bond, take Operation Thunderball,
as your government dubbed it. This project involved
the holding to ransom of the Western World by the acquisition
by me of two atomic weapons. Where lies the
crime in this, except in the Erewhon of international politics?
Rich boys are playing with rich toys. A poor boy
comes along and takes them and offers them back for
money. If the poor boy had been successful, what a valuable
by-product might have resulted for the whole world!
These were dangerous toys which, in the poor boy’s hands,
or let us say, to discard the allegory, in the hands of a
Castro, could lead to the wanton extinction of mankind.
By my action, I gave a dramatic example for all to see.
If I had been successful and the money had been handed
over, might not the threat of a recurrence of my attempt
have led to serious disarmament talks, to an abandonment
of these dangerous toys that might so easily get into the
wrong hands? You follow my reasoning? Then this recent
matter of the bacteriological warfare attack on England.
My dear Mister Bond, England is a sick nation by any
standards. By hastening the sickness to the brink of death,
might not Britain have been forced out of her lethargy
into the kind of community effort we witnessed during the
war? Cruel to be kind, Mister Bond. Where lies the great
crime there? And now this matter of my so-called ‘Castle
of Death.’ ” Blofeld paused, and his eyes took on an
inward look. He said, “I will make a confession to you,
Mister Bond. I have come to suffer from a certain lassitude
of mind which I am determined to combat. This comes in
part from being a unique genius who is alone in the world,
without honour—worse, misunderstood. No doubt much
of the root cause of this accidie is physical—liver, kidneys,
heart, the usual weak points of the middle-aged. But there
has developed in me a certain mental lameness, a disinterest
in humanity and its future, an utter boredom with the
affairs of mankind. So, not unlike the gourmet, with his
jaded palate, I now seek only the highly spiced, the sharp
impact on the taste buds, mental as well as physical, the
tickle that is truly exquisite. And so, Mister Bond, I came
to devise this useful and essentially humane project—the
offer of free death to those who seek release from the burden
of being alive. By doing so, I have not only provided
the common man with a solution to the problem of whether
to be or not to be, I have also provided the Japanese government,
though for the present they appear to be blind to
my magnanimity, with a tidy, out-of-the-way charnel-house
which relieves them of a constant flow of messy
occurrences involving the trains, the trams, the volcanoes,
and other unattractively public means of killing yourself.
You must admit that, far from being a crime, this is a
public service unique in the history of the world.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I saw one man being disgustingly murdered yesterday.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Tidying up, Mister Bond. Tidying up. The man came
here wishing to die. What you saw done was only helping
a weak man to his seat on the boat across the Styx. But I can
see that we have no contact. I cannot reach what serves you
for a mind. For your part, you cannot see further than the
simple gratification of your last cigarette. So enough of this
idle chatter. You have already kept us from our beds far
too long. Do you want to be hacked about in a vulgar
brawl, or will you offer your neck in the honourable
fashion?” Blofeld took a step forward and raised his
mighty sword in both hands and held it above his head.
The light from the oil lamps shimmered on the blade and
showed up the golden filigree engraving.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond knew what to do. He had known as soon as he had
been led back into the room and had seen the wounded
guard’s stave still standing in the shadowed angle of the
wall. But there was a bell-push near the woman. She would
have to be dealt with first! Had he learned enough of the
thrusts and parries of <span class="it">bojutsu</span> from the demonstration at
the <span class="it">ninja</span> training camp? Bond hurled himself to the left,
seized the stave, and leaped at the woman, whose hand was
already reaching upwards.</p>

<p class="pindent">The stave thudded into the side of her head, and she
sprawled grotesquely forward off her chair and lay still.
Blofeld’s sword whistled down, inches from his shoulder.
Bond twisted and lunged to his full extent, thrusting his
stave forward in the groove of his left hand almost as if
it had been a billiard cue. The tip caught Blofeld hard on
the breastbone and flung him against the wall, but he
hurtled back and came inexorably forward, swishing his
sword like a scythe. Bond aimed at his right arm, missed,
and had to retreat. He was concentrating on keeping his
weapon as well as his body away from the whirling steel,
or his stave would be cut like a matchstick, and its extra
length was his only hope of victory. Blofeld suddenly
lunged, expertly, his right knee bent forward. Bond feinted
to the left, but he was inches too slow and the tip of the
sword flicked his left ribs, drawing blood. But before
Blofeld could withdraw, Bond had slashed two-handed,
sideways, at his legs. His stave met bone. Blofeld cursed
and made an ineffectual stab at Bond’s weapon. Then he
advanced again, and Bond could only dodge and feint in
the middle of the room and make quick short lunges to
keep the enemy at bay. But he was losing ground in front
of the whirling steel, and now Blofeld, scenting victory,
took lightning steps and thrust forward like a snake. Bond
leaped sideways, saw his chance, and gave a mighty sweep
of his stave. It caught Blofeld on his right shoulder and
drew a curse from him. His main sword arm! Bond pressed
forward, lancing again and again with his weapon and
scoring several hits to the body, but one of Blofeld’s
parries caught the stave and cut off that one vital foot
of extra length as if it had been a candle-end. Blofeld
saw his advantage and began attacking, making furious
forward jabs that Bond could only parry by hitting at the
flat of the sword to deflect it. But now the stave was
slippery in the sweat of his hands and for the first time he
felt the cold breath of defeat at his neck. Blofeld seemed to
smell it, for he suddenly executed one of his fast running
lunges to get under Bond’s guard. Bond guessed the distance
of the wall behind him and leaped backwards against
it. Even so, he felt the sword-point fan across his stomach.
But hurled back by his impact with the wall, he counter-lunged,
swept the sword aside with his stave, and, dropping
his weapon, made a dive for Blofeld’s neck and got both
hands to it. For a moment, the two sweating faces were
almost up against each other. The boss of Blofeld’s sword
battered into Bond’s side. Bond hardly felt the crashing
blows. He pressed with his thumbs, and pressed and pressed
and heard the sword clang to the floor and felt Blofeld’s
fingers and nails tearing at his face, trying to reach his
eyes. Bond whispered through his gritted teeth, “Die, Blofeld!
Die!” And suddenly the tongue was out and the eyes
rolled upwards and the body slipped down to the ground.
But Bond followed it and knelt, his hands cramped round
the powerful neck, seeing nothing, hearing nothing, in the
terrible grip of blood lust.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond slowly came to himself. The golden dragon’s head
on the black silk kimono spat flame at him. He unclasped
his aching hands from round the neck and, not looking
again at the purple face, got to his feet. He staggered. God,
how his head hurt! What remained to be done? He tried
to cast his mind back. He had had a clever idea. What was
it? Oh yes, of course! He picked up Blofeld’s sword and
sleep-walked down the stone passage to the torture room.
He glanced up at the clock. Five minutes to midnight.
And there was the wooden box, mud-spattered, down
beside the throne on which he had sat, days, years before.
He went to it and hacked it open with one stroke of the
sword. Yes, there was the big wheel he had expected! He
knelt down and twisted and twisted until it was finally
closed. What would happen now? The end of the world?
Bond ran back up the passage. Now he must get out, get
away from this place! But his line of retreat was closed by
the guards! He tore aside a curtain and smashed the window
open with his sword. Outside there was a balustraded terrace
that seemed to run round this storey of the castle.
Bond looked around for something to cover his nakedness.
There was only Blofeld’s sumptuous kimono. Coldly,
Bond tore it off the corpse, put it on, and tied the sash.
The interior of the kimono was cold, like a snake’s skin.
He looked down at Irma Bunt. She was breathing heavily
with a drunken snore. Bond went to the window and
climbed out, minding his bare feet among the glass splinters.</p>

<p class="pindent">But he had been wrong! The balustrade was a brief one,
closed at both ends. He stumbled from end to end of it,
but there was no exit. He looked over the side. A sheer
hundred-foot drop to the gravel. A soft fluted whistle
above him caught his ear. He looked up. Only a breath of
wind in the moorings of that bloody balloon! But then a
lunatic idea came to him, a flashback to one of the old
Douglas Fairbanks films when the hero had swung across
a wide hall by taking a flying leap at the chandelier. This
helium balloon was strong enough to hold taut fifty feet
of framed cotton strip bearing the warning sign! Why
shouldn’t it be powerful enough to bear the weight of a
man?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond ran to the corner of the balustrade to which the
mooring line was attached. He tested it. It was taut as a
wire! From somewhere behind him there came a great
clamour in the castle. Had the woman woken up? Holding
on to the straining rope, he climbed on to the railing,
cut a foothold for himself in the cotton banner, and,
grasping the mooring rope with his right hand, chopped
downwards below him with Blofeld’s sword and threw
himself into space.</p>

<p class="pindent">It worked! There was a light night breeze, and he felt
himself wafted gently away over the moonlit park, over
the glittering, steaming lake, towards the sea. But he was
rising, not falling! The helium sphere was not in the least
worried by his weight! Then blue-and-yellow fire fluttered
from the upper storey of the castle, and an occasional
angry wasp zipped past him. Bond’s hands and feet were
beginning to ache with the strain of holding on. Something
hit him on the side of the head, the same side that
was already sending out its throbbing message of pain.
And that finished him. He knew it had! For now the
whole black silhouette of the castle swayed in the moonlight
and seemed to jig upwards and sideways and then
slowly dissolve like an ice-cream cone in sunshine. The top
storey crumbled first, then the next, and the next, and
then, after a moment, a huge jet of orange fire shot up
from hell towards the moon. A buffet of hot wind, followed
by an echoing crack of thunder, hit Bond and made
his balloon sway violently.</p>

<p class="pindent">What was it all about? Bond didn’t know or care. The
pain in his head was his whole universe. Punctured by a
bullet, the balloon was fast losing height. Below, the softly
swelling sea offered a bed. Bond let go with hands and feet
and plummeted down towards peace, towards the rippling
feathers of some childhood dream of softness and escape
from pain.</p>
