<h2 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_29"><span class="calibre1">The Death Collector</span></h2>

<p class="line8"><span class="sc">James Bond smiled</span> at this dramatic utterance. “A collector
of death? You mean he kills people?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No, Bondo-san. It is not as simple as that. He persuades,
or rather entices people to kill themselves.” Tiger paused,
the wide expanse of his brow furrowed. “No, that also is
not being just. Let us just say that he provides an easy and
attractive opportunity—a resort—for people to do away
with themselves. His present tally, in just under six
months, is something over five hundred Japanese.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Why don’t you arrest him, hang him?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Bondo-san, it is not as easy as that. I had better begin
at the beginning. In January of this year, there entered
the country, quite legally, a gentleman by the name of
Doctor Guntram Shatterhand. He was accompanied by
Frau Emmy Shatterhand, born de Bedon. They had Swiss
passports, and the doctor described himself as a horticulturalist
and botanist specializing in subtropical species. He
carried high references from the Jardin des Plantes in
Paris, Kew Gardens, and other authorities, but these were
couched in rather nebulous terms. He quickly got in touch
with the equivalent authorities in Japan and with experts
in the Ministry of Agriculture, and these gentlemen were
astonished and delighted to learn that Doctor Shatterhand
was prepared to spend no less than one million pounds on
establishing an exotic garden or park in this country
which he would stock with a priceless collection of rare
plants and shrubs from all over the world. These he would
import at his own expense in a sufficient state of maturity
to allow his park to be planted with the minimum of
delay—an extremely expensive procedure, if you know
anything about horticulture.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I know nothing about it. Like the Texan millionaires
who import full-grown palms and tropical shrubs from
Florida?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Exactly. Well, the park was not to be open to the
public, but would be freely available for study and research
work by authorized Japanese experts. All right. A
wonderful offer that was enthusiastically accepted by the
government, who, in return, granted the good doctor a
ten-year residence permit—a very rare privilege. Meanwhile,
as a matter of routine, the immigration authorities
made inquiries about the doctor through my department.
Since I have no representative in Switzerland, I referred
the matter to our friends of the C.I.A., and in due course
he was given complete clearance. It appeared that he was
of Swedish origin and was not widely known in Switzerland,
where he only possessed the minimum requirement
for residential status in the shape of two rooms in an apartment
block in Lausanne. But his financial standing with
the Union de Banques Suisses was grade one, which I understand
requires you to be a millionaire many times over.
Since money is almost the unique status symbol in Switzerland,
his clearance by the Swiss was impeccable, though
no information could be obtained about his standing as a
botanist. Kew and the Jardin des Plantes, on inquiry, referred
to him as an enthusiastic amateur who had made
valuable contributions to these institutions in the form of
tropical and subtropical species collected for him by
expeditions which he had financed. So! An interesting and
financially sound citizen whose harmless pursuits would
be of some benefit to Japan. Yes?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sounds like it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“After travelling round the country in great style, the
doctor took a fancy to a semi-ruined castle in Kyushu,
our southern island. The castle was in an extremely remote
corner of the coast not far from Fukuoka, the principal
prefecture of the island, and in ancient times it had been
one of a line of castles facing the Tsushima Strait, the scene
of the famous defeat of the Russian navy. These castles
were originally designed to repel attacks from the Korean
mainland. Most of them had fallen into disrepair, but the
one chosen by the doctor was a giant edifice that had been
occupied until the last war by a rich and eccentric family
of textile millionaires, and its monumental surrounding
wall was just what the doctor required for the privacy of
his undertaking. An army of builders and decorators
moved in. Meanwhile, the plants ordered by the doctor
began arriving from all over the world, and with a blanket
customs clearance from the Ministry of Agriculture, they
were planted in appropriate soils and settings. Here I
should mention that an additional reason for the doctor’s
choice of site was that the property, which extends for
some five hundred acres, is highly volcanic and furnished
with many geysers and fumaroles, which are common in
Japan. These would provide, all the year round, the temperature
needed for the successful propagation of these
tropical shrubs, trees, and plants from the equatorial
zones. The doctor and his wife, who is by the way extremely
ugly, moved into the castle with all speed and set
about recruiting staff in the neighbourhood who would
look after the establishment and its grounds.” Here Tiger
assumed his sorrowful face. “And it was at this time that
I should not have dismissed as fanciful certain reports that
reached me from the chief of police at Fukuoka. These
were to the effect that the doctor was recruiting his staff
uniquely from former members of the Black Dragon Society.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“And what might that be?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Have been,” Tiger corrected him. “The society was
officially disbanded before the war. But in its heyday it was
the most feared and powerful secret society in Japan. It
consisted originally of the dregs of the <span class="it">soshi</span>—the unemployed
<span class="it">samurai</span> who were left high and dry after the Meiji
Restoration of about a hundred years ago—but it later
recruited terrorists, gangsters, Fascist politicians, cashiered
officers from the navy and army, secret agents, soldiers
of fortune and other riff-raff, but also big men in industry
and finance, and even the occasional cabinet minister who
found Black Dragon support of much practical value
when dirty work had to be done. And the odd thing is,
though it does not seem so odd to me today, that the
doctor should have chosen his site, leaving out its practical
amenities, in just that corner of Japan that used to be the
headquarters of the Black Dragons and has always been a
hotbed of extremists. Toyama Mitsuru, the former head
of the Black Dragons, came from Fukuoka; so did the
anarchist Hirota, and Nakano, leader of the former Tohokai,
or Fascist group, in the Diet. It has always been a
nest of scoundrels, this district, and it remains so today.
These extreme sects never die out completely, as you have
recently, my dear Bondo-san, found in the resurgence of
the Black Shirts in England, and this Doctor Shatterhand
found no difficulty in collecting some twenty extremely
tough and dangerous characters around him, all most correctly
clothed as servants and gardeners and, no doubt,
perfectly good at their ostensible jobs. On one occasion the
prefect of police thought it his duty to make a courtesy
call and give his distinguished inhabitant a word of caution.
But the doctor dismissed the matter on the grounds
that competent guards would be necessary to maintain his
privacy and keep trespassers away from his valuable collection
of plants. This seemed reasonable enough, and anyway
the doctor appeared to be under high patronage in Tokyo.
The prefect bowed himself out, much impressed with the
lavish display of wealth in the heart of his poor province.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger Tanaka paused and poured more <span class="it">saké</span> for Bond
and more Suntory for himself. Bond took the opportunity
to ask just how dangerous this Black Dragon Society had
really been. “Was it the equivalent of the Chinese tongs?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Much more powerful. You have heard of the Ching-Pang
and Hung-Pang tongs that were so much feared in
China in the days of the Kuomintang. No? Well, the Black
Dragons were a hundred times worse. To have them on
your heels was certain death. They were totally ruthless
and not out of any particular political conviction. They
operated strictly for cash.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, under this doctor from Switzerland, have they
done any harm yet?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh no. They are nothing more than he says—personal
staff, at the worst, if you like, a bodyguard. No. The
trouble is quite different, much more complex. You see,
this man Shatterhand has created what I can only describe
as a garden of death.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond raised his eyebrows. Really, for the head of a
national secret service, Tiger’s metaphors were almost
ridiculously dramatic.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger exploded his golden smile. “Bondo-san, I can see
from your face that you think I am either drunk or mad.
Now listen. This Doctor Shatterhand has filled this famous
park of his uniquely with poisonous vegetation, the lakes
and streams with poisonous fish, and he has infested the
place with snakes, scorpions, and poisonous spiders. He and
this hideous wife of his are not harmed by these things,
because whenever they leave the castle he wears full suits
of armour of the seventeenth century, and she wears some
other kind of protective clothing. His workers are not
harmed because they wear rubber boots up to the knee,
and <span class="it">maskos</span>, that is, antiseptic gauze masks such as many
people in Japan wear over the mouth and nose to avoid
infection or the spreading of infection.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What a daft set-up.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger reached into the folds of the <span class="it">yukata</span> he had
changed into when they entered the house. He brought
out several sheets of paper pinned together. He handed
them over to Bond and said, “Be patient. Do not judge
what you do not understand. I know nothing of these
poisonous plants. Nor, I expect, do you. Here is a translation
of a list of those that have so far been planted by this
doctor, together with comments by our Ministry of Agriculture.
Read it. Take your time. You will be interested
to learn what charming vegetation grows on the surface
of the globe.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took the papers. The first page was a general note
on vegetable poisons. There followed an annotated list.
The papers bore the seal of the Japanese Ministry of Agriculture.
This is what he read:</p>

<div class="blockquote-right95percent">

<p class="pindent">Bond finished his reading. He handed the papers back.
He said, “Doctor Shatterhand’s garden is indeed a lovesome
thing, God wot.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“And you have of course heard of the South American
piranha fish? They can strip a whole horse to the bones
in less than an hour. The scientific name is Serrasalmus.
The sub-species Nattereri is the most voracious. Our good
doctor has preferred these fish to our native goldfish for
his lakes. You see what I mean?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No,” said Bond, “frankly I don’t. What’s the object
of the good doctor’s exercise?”</p>
