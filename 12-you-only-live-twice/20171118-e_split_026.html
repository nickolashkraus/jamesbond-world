<p class="line8"><span class="sc">At six o’clock</span> in the evening, the deep bell tolled briefly
from the castle and dusk came like the slow drawing of
a violet blind over the day. Crickets began to zing in a
loud chorus, and geckos chuckled in the shrubbery. The
pink dragonflies disappeared and large horned toads appeared
in quantities from their mud holes on the edge of
the lake and, so far as Bond could see through his spy-hole,
seemed to be catching gnats attracted by the shining
pools of their eyes. Then the four guards reappeared,
and there came the fragrant smell of a bonfire they had
presumably lit to consume the refuse they had collected
during the day. They went to the edge of the lake and
raked in the tattered scraps of blue clothing and, amidst
delighted laughter, emptied long bones out of the fragments
into the water. One of them ran off with the rags,
presumably to add them to the bonfire, and Bond got under
cover as the others pushed their wheelbarrows up the
slope and stowed them away in the hut. They stood chattering
happily in the dusk until the fourth arrived, and
then, without noticing the slashed and disarrayed sacks in
the shadows, they filed off in the direction of the castle.</p>

<p class="pindent">After an interval, Bond got up and stretched and shook
the dust out of his hair and clothes. His back still ached,
but his overwhelming sensation was the desperate urge for
a cigarette. All right. It might be his last. He sat down
and drank a little water and munched a large wedge of
the highly flavoured pemmican, then took another swig at
the water-bottle. He took out his single packet of Shinsei
and lit up, holding the cigarette between cupped hands
and quickly blowing out the match. He dragged the smoke
deep down into his lungs. It was bliss! Another drag and
the prospect of the night seemed less daunting. It was
surely going to be all right! He thought briefly of Kissy,
who would now be eating her bean curd and fish and
preparing the night’s swim in her mind. A few hours more
and she would be near him. But what would have happened
in those few hours? Bond smoked the cigarette until
it burned his fingers, then crushed out the stub and
pushed the dead fragments down through a crack in the
floor. It was seven-thirty, and already some of the insect
noises of sundown had ceased. Bond went meticulously
about his preparations.</p>

<p class="pindent">At nine o’clock, he left the hide-out. Again the moon
blazed down, and there was total silence except for the
distant burping and bubbling of the fumaroles and the occasional
sinister chuckle of a gecko from the shrubbery.
He took the same route as the night before, came through
the same belt of trees, and stood looking up at the great
bat-winged donjon that towered up to the sky. He noticed
for the first time that the warning balloon with its advertisement
of danger was tethered to a pole on the corner of
the balustrade surrounding what appeared to be the main
floor—the third, or centre one of the five. Here, from several
windows, yellow light shone faintly, and Bond guessed
that this would be his target area. He let out a deep sigh
and strode quietly off across the gravel and came without
incident to the tiny entrance under the wooden bridge.</p>

<p class="pindent">The black <span class="it">ninja</span> suit was as full of concealed pockets as
a conjurer’s tail-coat. Bond took out a pencil flashlight and
a small steel file and set to work on a link of the chain.
Occasionally he paused to spit into the deepening groove
to lessen the rasp of metal on metal, but then there came
the final crack of parting steel, and using the file as a lever,
he bent the link open and quietly removed the padlock and
chain from its stanchions. He pressed lightly, and the door
gave inwards. He took out his torch and pushed farther,
probing the darkness ahead with his thin beam. It was as
well he did so. On the stone floor where his first step past
the open door would have taken him lay a yawning man-trap,
its rusty iron jaws, perhaps a yard across, waiting for
him to step on the thin covering of straw that partially
concealed it. Bond winced as, in his imagination, he heard
the iron clang as the saw-teeth bit into his leg below the
knee. There would be other such booby traps—he must
keep every sense on the alert!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond closed the door softly behind him, stepped round
the trap, and swept the beam of his torch ahead and
around him. Nothing but velvety blackness. He was in
some vast underground cellar where no doubt the food supplies
for a small army had once been stored. A shadow
swept across the thin beam of light, then another and
another, and there was a shrill squeaking from all around
him. Bond didn’t mind bats or believe the Victorian myth
that they got caught in your hair. Their radar was too
good. He crept slowly forward, watching only the rough
stone flags ahead of him. He passed one or two bulky
arched pillars, and now the great cellar seemed to narrow
because he could just see walls to right and left of him and
above him an arched cobwebby roof. Yes, here were the
stone steps leading upwards! He climbed them softly and
counted twenty of them before he came to the entrance,
a wide double door with no lock on his side. He pushed
gently and could feel and hear the resistance of a rickety-sounding
lock. He took out a heavy jemmy and probed.
Its sharp jaws notched round some sort of a cross-bolt, and
Bond levered hard sideways until there came the tearing
sound of old metal and the tinkle of nails or screws on
stone. He pushed softly on the crack, and with a hideously
loud report, the rest of the lock came away and half the
door swung open with a screech of old hinges. Beyond was
more darkness. Bond stepped through and listened, his
torch doused. But he was still deep in the bowels of the
castle, and there was no sound. He switched on again.
More stone stairs leading up to a modern door of polished
timber. He went up them and carefully turned the metal
door handle. No lock this time! He softly pushed the door
open and found himself in a long stone corridor that sloped
on upwards. At the end was yet another modern door, and
beneath it showed a thin strip of light!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked noiselessly up the incline and then held
his breath and put his ear to the keyhole. Dead silence. He
grasped the handle and inched the door open and then,
satisfied, went through and closed the door behind him,
leaving it on the latch. He was in the main hall of the
castle. The big entrance door was on his left, and a well-used
strip of red carpet stretched away from it and across
the fifty feet of hall into the shadows that were not reached
by the single large oil lamp over the entrance. The hall was
not embellished in any way, save for the strip of carpet,
and its roof was a maze of longitudinal and cross beams
interspersed with latticed bamboo over the same rough
plaster-work as covered the walls. There was still the same
castle-smell of cold stone.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond kept away from the carpet and hugged the shadows
of the walls. He guessed that he was now on the main floor
and that somewhere straight ahead was his quarry. He was
well inside the citadel. So far so good!</p>

<p class="pindent">The next door, obviously the entrance to one of the
public rooms, had a simple latch to it. Bond bent and put
his eye to the keyhole. Another dimly lit interior. No
sound. He eased up the latch, inched the door ajar, and
then open, and went through. It was a second vast chamber,
but this time one of baronial splendour—the main reception
room, Bond guessed, where Blofeld would receive
visitors. Between tall red curtains, edged with gold, fine
set-pieces of armour and weapons hung on the white plaster
walls, and there was much heavy antique furniture arranged
in conventional groupings on a vast central carpet
in royal blue. The rest of the floor was of highly polished
boards, which reflected back the lights from two great oil
lanterns that hung from the high timbered roof, similar to
that of the entrance hall, but here with the main beams
decorated in a zigzag motif of dark red. Bond, looking for
places of concealment, chose the widely spaced curtains
and, slipping softly from one refuge to the next, reached
the small door at the end of the chamber that would, he
guessed, lead to the private apartments.</p>

<p class="pindent">He bent down to listen, but immediately leaped for
cover behind the nearest curtains. Steps were approaching!
Bond undid the thin chain from around his waist, wrapped
it round his left fist, took the jemmy in his right hand,
and waited, his eyes glued to a chink in the dusty-smelling
material.</p>

<p class="pindent">The small door opened halfway to show the back of one
of the guards. He wore a black belt with a holster. Would
this be Kono, the man who translated for Blofeld? He had
probably had some job with the Germans during the war—in
the <span class="it">Kempeitai</span>, perhaps. What was he doing? He appeared
to be fiddling with some piece of apparatus behind
the door. A light switch? No, there was no electric light.
Apparently satisfied, the man backed out, bowed deeply to
the interior, and closed the door. He wore no <span class="it">masko</span>, and
Bond caught a brief glimpse of a surly slit-eyed brownish
face as he passed Bond’s place of concealment and walked
on across the reception chamber. Bond heard the click of
the far door, and then there was silence. He waited a good
five minutes before gently shifting the curtain so that he
could see down the room. He was alone.</p>

<p class="pindent">And now for the last lap!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond kept his weapons in his hands and crept back to
the door. This time no sound came from behind it. But
the guard had bowed. Oh well! Probably out of respect
for the aura of the Master. Bond quietly but firmly thrust
the door open and leaped through, ready for the attacking
sprint.</p>

<p class="pindent">A totally empty, totally featureless length of passageway
yawned at his dramatics. It stretched perhaps twenty
feet in front of him. It was dimly lit by a central oil lamp,
and its floor was of the usual highly polished boards. A
“nightingale floor”? No. The guard’s footsteps had uttered
no warning creaks. But from behind the facing door at the
end came the sound of music. It was Wagner, the “Ride
of the Valkyries,” being played at medium pitch. Thank
you, Blofeld! thought Bond. Most helpful cover. And he
crept softly forward down the centre of the passage.</p>

<p class="pindent">When it came, there was absolutely no warning. One
step across the exact halfway point of the flooring and, like
a seesaw, the whole twenty feet of boards swivelled noiselessly
on some central axis. Bond, arms and legs flailing
and hands scrabbling desperately for a grip, found himself
hurtling down into a black void. The guard! The fiddling
about behind the door! He had been adjusting the lever
that set the trap, the traditional oubliette of ancient castles.
And Bond had forgotten! As his body plunged off the end
of the inclined platform into space, an alarm bell, triggered
by the mechanism of the trap, brayed hysterically.
Bond had a fractional impression of the platform, relieved
of his weight, swinging back into position above him, then
he crashed shatteringly into unconsciousness.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond swam reluctantly up through the dark tunnel
towards the blinding pinpoint of light. Why wouldn’t
someone stop hitting him? What had he done to deserve it?
He had got two <span class="it">awabis</span>. He could feel them in his hands,
sharp-edged and rough. That was as much as Kissy could
expect of him. “Kissy,” he mumbled, “stop it! Stop it,
Kissy!”</p>

<p class="pindent">The pinpoint of light expanded, became an expanse of
straw-covered floor on which he was crouching while the
open hand crashed sideways into his face. Piff! Paff! With
each slap the splitting pain in his head exploded into a
thousand separate pain fragments. Bond saw the edge of
the boat above him and desperately raised himself to grasp
at it. He held up the <span class="it">awabis</span> to show that he had done his
duty. He opened his hands to drop them into the tub.
Consciousness flooded back, and he saw the two handfuls
of straw dribble to the ground. But the blows had stopped.
And now he could see, indistinctly, through a mist of pain.
That brown face. Those slit eyes. Kono, the guard. And
someone else was holding a torch for him. Then it all came
back. No <span class="it">awabis</span>! No Kissy! Something dreadful had happened!
Everything had gone wrong! <span class="it">Shimatta!</span> I have
made a mistake! Tiger! The clue clicked and total realization
swept through Bond’s mind. Careful, now. You’re
deaf and dumb. You’re a Japanese miner from Fukuoka.
Get the record straight. To hell with the pain in your
head. Nothing’s broken. Play it cool. Bond put his hands
down to his sides. He realized for the first time that he was
naked save for the brief vee of the black cotton <span class="it">ninja</span>
underpants. He bowed deeply and straightened himself.
Kono, his hand at his open holster, fired furious Japanese
at him. Bond licked at the blood that was trickling down
his face and looked blank, stupid. Kono took out his small
automatic, gestured. Bond bowed again, got to his feet,
and, with a brief glance round the straw-strewn oubliette
into which he had fallen, followed the unseen guard with
the torch out of the cell.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were stairs and a corridor and a door. Kono
stepped forward and knocked.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then Bond was standing in the middle of a small
pleasant library-type room and the second guard was laying
out on the floor Bond’s <span class="it">ninja</span> suit and the appallingly
incriminating contents of his pockets. Blofeld, dressed in a
magnificent black silk kimono across which a golden
dragon sprawled, stood leaning against the mantelpiece
beneath which a Japanese brazier smouldered. It was him
all right. The bland high forehead, the pursed purple wound
of a mouth, now shadowed by a heavy grey-black moustache
that drooped at the corners, on its way, perhaps, to
achieving mandarin proportions, the mane of white hair
he had grown for the part of Monsieur le Comte de Bleuville,
the black bullet-holes of the eyes. And beside him,
completing the picture of a homely couple at ease after
dinner, sat Irma Bunt, in the full regalia of a high-class
Japanese lady, the petit point of a single chrysanthemum
lying in her lap waiting for those pudgy hands to take it
up when the cause of this unseemly disturbance had been
ascertained. The puffy square face, the tight bun of mousy
hair, the thin wardress mouth, the light-brown, almost
yellow eyes. By God, thought Bond dully, here they are!
Within easy reach! They would both be dead by now but
for his single criminal error. Might there still be some way
of turning the tables? If only the pain in his head would
stop throbbing!</p>

<p class="pindent">Blofeld’s tall sword stood against the wall. He picked it
up and strode out into the room. He stood over the pile
of Bond’s possessions and picked them over with the tip
of the sword. He hooked up the black suit. He said in
German, “And what is this, Kono?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The head guard replied in the same language. His voice
was uneasy, and his eye-slits swivelled with a certain
respect towards Bond and away again. “It is a <span class="it">ninja</span> suit,
Herr Doktor. These are people who practise the secret arts
of <span class="it">ninjutsu</span>. Their secrets are very ancient, and I know
little of them. They are the art of moving by stealth, of
being invisible, of killing without weapons. These people
used to be much feared in Japan. I was not aware that they
still existed. This man has undoubtedly been sent to assassinate
you, my lord. But for the magic of the passage, he
might well have succeeded.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“And who is he?” Blofeld looked keenly at Bond. “He
is tall for a Japanese.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“The men from the mines are often tall men, my lord.
He carries a paper saying that he is deaf and dumb. And
other papers, which appear to be in order, stating that he
is a miner from Fukuoka. I do not believe this. His hands
have some broken nails, but they are not the hands of a
miner.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I do not believe it either. But we shall soon find out.”
Blofeld turned to the woman. “What do you think, my
dear? You have a good nose for such problems—the instincts
of a woman.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Irma Bunt rose and came and stood beside him. She
looked piercingly at Bond and then walked slowly round
him, keeping her distance. When she came to the left
profile, she said softly, with awe, “Du lieber Gott!” She
went back to Blofeld. She said in a hoarse whisper, still
staring, almost with horror, at Bond, “It cannot be! But
it is! The scar down the right cheek! The profile! And
the eyebrows have been shaved to give that upward tilt!”
She turned to Blofeld. She said decisively, “This is the
English agent. This is the man Bond, James Bond, the man
whose wife you killed. The man who went under the name
of Sir Hilary Bray.” She added fiercely, “I swear it! You
have got to believe me, lieber Ernst!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Blofeld’s eyes had narrowed. “I see a certain resemblance.
But how has he come here? How has he found me? Who
sent him?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“The Japanese Geheimdienst. They will certainly have
relations with the British Secret Service.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I cannot believe it! If that was so, they would have
come with warrants to arrest me. There are too many unknown
factors in this business. We must proceed with great
circumspection and extract the whole truth from this man.
We must at once find out if he is deaf and dumb. That is
the first step. The Question Room should settle that. But
first of all, he must be softened up.” He turned to Kono.
“Tell Kazama to get to work.”</p>
