<p class="line8"><span class="sc">M., his shoulders</span> hunched inside the square-cut blue suit,
was standing by the big window looking out across the
park. Without looking round he said, “Sit down.” No
name, no number!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took his usual place across the desk from M.’s tall-armed
chair. He noticed that there was no file on the
expanse of red leather in front of the chair. And the In
and Out baskets were both empty. Suddenly he felt really
bad about everything—about letting M. down, letting the
Service down, letting himself down. This empty desk, the
empty chair, were the final accusation. We have nothing
for you, they seemed to say. You’re no use to us any more.
Sorry. It’s been nice knowing you, but there it is.</p>

<p class="pindent">M. came over and sat heavily down in the chair and
looked across at Bond. There was nothing to read in the
lined sailor’s face. It was as impassive as the polished blue
leather of the empty chair-back had been.</p>

<p class="pindent">M. said, “You know why I’ve sent for you?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I can guess, sir. You can have my resignation.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M. said angrily, “What in hell are you talking about?
It’s not your fault that the Double-O Section’s been idle
for so long. It’s the way things go. You’ve had flat periods
before now—months with nothing in your line.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“But I made a mess of the last two jobs. And I know
my medical’s been pretty poor these last few months.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Nonsense. There’s nothing the matter with you.
You’ve been through a bad time. You’ve had good reason
to be a bit under the weather. As for the last two
assignments, anyone can make mistakes. But I can’t have
idle hands around the place, so I’m taking you out of the
Double-O Section.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s heart had temporarily risen. Now it plummeted
again. The old man was being kind, trying to let him
down lightly. He said, “Then, if it’s all the same to you,
sir, I’d still like to put in my resignation. I’ve held the
Double-O number for too long. I’m not interested in staff
work, I’m afraid, sir. And no good at it either.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M. did something Bond had never seen him do before.
He lifted his right fist and brought it crashing down on
the desk. “Who the devil do you think you’re talking to?
Who the devil d’you think’s running this show? God in
Heaven! I send for you to give you promotion and the
most important job of your career and you talk to me
about resignation! Pig-headed young fool!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was dumbfounded. A great surge of excitement
ran through him. What in hell was all this about? He
said, “I’m terribly sorry, sir. I thought I’d been letting
the side down lately.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’ll soon tell you when you’re letting the side down.”
M. thumped the desk for a second time, but less hard.
“Now listen to me, I’m giving you acting promotion to
the Diplomatic Section. Four-figure number and a thousand
a year extra pay. You won’t know much about the
section, but I can tell you there are only two other men
in it. You can keep your present office and your secretary,
if you like. In fact I would prefer it. I don’t want
your change of duty to get about. Understand?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“In any case, you’ll be leaving for Japan inside a week.
The Chief of Staff is handling the arrangements personally.
Not even my secretary knows about it. As you can
see,” M. waved his hand, “there’s not even a file on the
case. That’s how important it is.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“But why have you chosen me, sir?” Bond’s heart was
thumping. This was the most extraordinary change in his
fortunes that had ever come about! Ten minutes before
he had been on the rubbish heap, his career, his life in
ruins, and now here he was being set-up on a pinnacle!
What the hell was it all about?</p>

<p class="pindent">“For the simple reason that the job’s impossible. No, I
won’t go as far as that. Let’s say totally improbable of
success. You’ve shown in the past that you have an aptitude
for difficult assignments. The only difference here is
that there won’t be any strong-arm stuff.” M. gave a
frosty smile. “None of the gun-play you pride yourself on
so much. It’ll just be a question of your wits and nothing
else. But if you bring it off, which I very much doubt,
you will just about double our intelligence about the Soviet
Union.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Can you tell me some more about it, sir?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Have to, as there’s nothing written down. Lower-echelon
stuff, about the Japanese Secret Service and so forth,
you can get from Section J. The Chief of Staff will tell
Colonel Hamilton to answer your questions freely, though
you will tell him nothing about the purpose of your mission.
Understood?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well now. You know a bit about cryptography?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“The bare bones, sir. I’ve preferred to keep clear of the
subject. Better that way in case the Opposition ever got
hold of me.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Quite right. Well now, the Japanese are past masters
at it. They’ve got the right mentality for finicky problems
in letters and numbers. Since the war, under C.I.A.
guidance, they’ve built incredible cracking machines—far
ahead of I.B.M. and so forth. And for the last year they’ve
been reading the cream of the Soviet traffic from Vladivostok
and Oriental Russia—diplomatic, naval, air-force,
the lot.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s terrific, sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Terrific for the C.I.A.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Aren’t they passing it on to us, sir? I thought we were
hand in glove with C.I.A. all along the line.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Not in the Pacific. They regard that as their private
preserve. When Allen Dulles was in charge, we used at
least to get digests of any stuff that concerned us, but this
new man McCone has cracked down on all that. He’s a
good man, all right, and we get along well personally, but
he’s told me candidly that he’s acting under orders—National
Security Council. They’re worried about our security.
Can’t blame them. I’m equally worried about theirs.
Two of their top cryptographers defected a couple of years
ago—they must have blown a lot of the stuff we give the
Americans. Trouble with this so-called democracy of ours
is that the press get hold of these cases and write them
up too big. <span class="it">Pravda</span> doesn’t burst into tears when one of
their men come over to us. <span class="it">Izvestia</span> doesn’t ask for a public
enquiry. Somebody in K.G.B. gets hell, I suppose. But
at least they’re allowed to get on with their job instead
of having retired members of the Supreme Soviet pawing
through their files and telling them how to run a secret
service.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond knew that M. had tendered his resignation after
the Prenderghast case. This had involved a Head of Station
with homosexual tendencies who had recently, amidst
world-wide publicity, been given thirty years for treason.
Bond himself had had to give evidence in that particular
case, and he knew that the Questions in the House, the
case at the Old Bailey, and the hearings before the Farrer
Tribunal on the Intelligence Services that had followed
had held up all work at headquarters for at least a month
and brought about the suicide of a totally innocent Head
of Section who had taken the whole affair as a direct reflection
on his own probity. To get M. back on the track,
Bond said, “About this stuff the Japanese are getting.
Where do I come in, sir?”</p>

<p class="pindent">M. put both hands flat on the table. It was the old gesture
when he came to the sixty-four-dollar question, and
Bond’s heart lifted even further at the sight of it. “There’s
a man in Tokyo called Tiger Tanaka. Head of their secret
service. Can’t remember what they call it. Some unpronounceable
Japanese rubbish. He’s quite a man. First at
Oxford. Came back here and spied for them before the
war. Joined the <span class="it">Kempeitai</span>, their wartime Gestapo, trained
as a <span class="it">kami-kaze</span>, and would be dead by now but for the
surrender. Well, he’s the chap who has control of the stuff
we want, I want, the Chiefs of Staff want. You’re to go
out there and get it off him. How, I don’t know. That’s
up to you. But you can see why I say you’re unlikely to
succeed. He’s in fief”—Bond was amused by the old Scottish
expression—“to the C.I.A. He probably doesn’t think
much of us.” M.’s mouth bent down at the corners. “People
don’t these days. They may be right or wrong. I’m
not a politician. He doesn’t know much about the Service
except what he’s penetrated or heard from the C.I.A.
And that won’t be greatly to our advantage, I’d say. We
haven’t had a station in Japan since 1950. No traffic. It
all went to the Americans. You’ll be working under the
Australians. They tell me their man’s good. Section J says
so too. Anyway, that’s the way it is. If anyone can bring
it off, you can. Care to have a try, James?”</p>

<p class="pindent">M.’s face was suddenly friendly. It wasn’t friendly often.
James Bond felt a quick warmth of affection for this
man who had ordered his destiny for so long, but whom
he knew so little. His instinct told him that there were
things hidden behind this assignment, motives which he
didn’t understand. Was this a rescue job on him? Was M.
giving him his last chance? But it sounded solid enough.
The reasons for it stood up. Hopeless? Impossible? Perhaps.
Why hadn’t M. chosen a Jap speaker? Bond had
never been east of Hong Kong. But then Orientalists had
their own particular drawbacks—too much tied up with
tea ceremonies and flower arrangements and Zen and so
forth. No. It sounded a true bill. He said, “Yes, sir. I’d
like to have a try.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M. gave an abrupt nod. “Good.” He leant forward and
pressed a button on the intercom. “Chief of Staff? What
number have you allotted to 007? Right. He’s coming to
see you straightaway.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M. leant back. He gave one of his rare smiles. “You’re
stuck with your old digit. All right, four sevens. Go along
and get briefed.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “Right, sir. And, er, thank you.” He got up
and walked over to the door and let himself out. He
walked straight over to Miss Moneypenny and bent down
and kissed her on the cheek. She turned pink and put a
hand up to where he had kissed her. Bond said, “Be an
angel, Penny, and ring down to Mary and tell her she’s
got to get out of whatever she’s doing tonight. I’m taking
her out to dinner. Scotts. Tell her we’ll have our first
roast grouse of the year and pink champagne. Celebration.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What of?” Miss Moneypenny’s eyes were suddenly
wide and excited.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh I don’t know. The Queen’s birthday or something.
Right?” James Bond crossed the room and went into the
Chief of Staff’s office.</p>

<p class="pindent">Miss Moneypenny picked up the inter-office telephone
and passed on the message in a thrilled voice. She said, “I
do think he’s all right again, Mary. It’s all there again like
it used to be. Heaven knows what M.’s been saying to
him. He had lunch with Sir James Molony today. Don’t
tell James that. But it may have something to do with it.
He’s with the Chief of Staff now. And Bill said he wasn’t
to be disturbed. Sounds like some kind of a job. Bill was
very mysterious.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bill Tanner, late Colonel Tanner of the Sappers and
Bond’s best friend in the Service, looked up from his heavily
laden desk. He grinned with pleasure at what he saw.
He said, “Take a pew, James. So you’ve bought it?
Thought you might. But it’s a stinker all right. Think
you can bring it off?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Not an earthly, I’d guess,” said Bond cheerfully. “This
man Tanaka sounds a tough nut, and I’m no great hand
at diplomacy. But why did M. pick on me, Bill? I thought
I was in the dog-house because of messing up those last
two jobs. I was all set to go into chicken farming. Now,
be a good chap and tell me what’s the real score.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bill Tanner had been ready for that one. He said easily,
“Balls, James. You’ve been running through a bad patch.
We all hit ’em sometimes. M. just thought you’d be the
best man for the job. You know he’s got an entirely misplaced
opinion of your abilities. Anyway, it’ll be a change
from your usual rough-housing. Time you moved up out
of that damned Double-O Section of yours. Don’t you
ever think about promotion?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Absolutely not,” said Bond with fervour. “As soon as
I get back from this caper, I’ll ask for my old number
back again. But tell me, how am I supposed to set about
this business? What’s this Australian cover consist of?
Have I got anything to offer this wily Oriental in exchange
for his jewels? How’s the stuff to be transmitted
back here if I do get my hands on it? Must be the hell
of a lot of traffic.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“He can have the entire product of Station H. He can
send one of his own staffers down to Hong Kong to sit
in with us if he likes. He’ll probably be pretty well off
on China already, but he won’t have anything as high-grade
as our Macao link, the ‘Blue Route.’ Hamilton will
tell you all about that. In Tokyo, the man you’ll be working
with is an Aussie called Henderson—Richard Lovelace
Henderson. Fancy name, but Section J and all the old Jap
hands say he’s a good man. You’ll have an Australian passport,
and we’ll fix for you to go out as his number two.
That’ll give you diplomatic status and a certain amount
of face, which counts for damn near everything out there,
according to Hamilton. If you get the stuff, Henderson
will push it back to us through Melbourne. We’ll give him
a communications staff to handle it. Next question.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What are the C.I.A. going to say about all this? After
all, it’s bare-faced poaching.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“They don’t own Japan. Anyway, they’re not to know.
That’s up to this fellow Tanaka. He’ll have to fix the
machinery for getting it into the Australian embassy.
That’s his worry. But the whole thing’s on pretty thin
ice. The main problem is to make sure he doesn’t go
straight along to the C.I.A. and tell ’em of your approach.
If you get blown, we’ll just have to get the Australians
to hold the baby. They’ve done it before when we’ve been
bowled out edging our way into the Pacific. We’re good
friends with their service. First-rate bunch of chaps. And,
anyway, the C.I.A.’s hands aren’t as clean as all that.
We’ve got a whole file of cases where they’ve crossed wires
with us round the world. Often dangerously. We can
throw that book at McCone if this business blows up in
our faces. But part of your job is to see that it doesn’t.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Seems to me I’m getting all balled up in high politics.
Not my line of country at all. But is this stuff really as
vital as M. says?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Absolutely. If you get hold of it, your grateful country
will probably buy you that chicken farm you’re always
talking about.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“So be it. Now, if you’ll give Hamilton a buzz, I’ll go
and start learning all about the mysterious East.”</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">“<span class="it">Kangei!</span> Welcome aboard,” said the pretty kimono-ed
and obi-ed stewardess of Japan Air Lines as, a week later,
James Bond settled into the comfortable window seat of
the four-jet, turbofan Douglas DC-8 at London Airport
and listened to the torrent of soft Japanese coming from
the tannoy that would be saying all those things about
life-jackets and the flying time to Orly. The sick-bags “in
case of motion disturbance” were embellished with pretty
bamboo emblems and according to the exquisitely bound
travel folder, the random scribbles on the luggage rack
above his head were “the traditional and auspicious tortoiseshell
motif.” The stewardess bowed and handed him
a dainty fan, a small hot towel in a wicker basket, and
a sumptuous menu that included a note to the effect that
an assortment of cigarettes, perfumes, and pearls were
available for sale. Then they were off with 50,000 pounds
of thrust on the first leg of the four that would take the
good aircraft Yoshino over the North Pole to Tokyo.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gazed at the picture of three oranges (no! after
an hour he decided they were persimmons) in a blue bowl
that faced him and, when the aircraft flattened out at
30,000 feet, ordered the first of the chain of brandies and
ginger ales that was to sustain him over the Channel, a
leg of the North Sea, the Kattegat, the Arctic Ocean, the
Beaufort Sea, the Bering Sea, and the North Pacific Ocean,
and decided that, whatever happened on this impossible
assignment, he would put up no resistance to his old skin
being sloughed off him on the other side of the world.
By the time he was admiring the huge stuffed polar bear
at Anchorage, Alaska, the embrace of J.A.L.’s soft wings
had persuaded him that he didn’t even mind if the colour
of the new skin was to be yellow.</p>
