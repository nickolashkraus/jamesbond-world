<p class="line8"><span class="sc">James Bond</span> went through the rest of the morning like
an automaton. While he tried on his <span class="it">ninja</span> equipment and
watched each item being carefully packed into a floatable
plastic container, his mind was totally occupied with the
image of his enemy—this man Blofeld, the great gangster
who had founded SPECTRE, the Special Executive for
Counter-intelligence, Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion,
the man who was wanted by the police of all the NATO
countries, the man who had murdered Tracy, Bond’s wife
for less than a day, a bare nine months ago. And in those
nine months, this evil genius had invented a new method
of collecting death, as Tiger had put it. This cover as the
Swiss Doctor Shatterhand, as a rich botanist, must have
been one of the many he had wisely built up over the
years. It would have been easy. A few gifts of rare plants
to famous botanical gardens, the financing of a handful
of expeditions, and all the while in the back of his mind
the plan one day to retire and “cultiver son jardin.” And
what a garden! A garden that would be like a deadly fly-trap
for human beings, a killing bottle for those who
wanted to die. And of course Japan, with the highest suicide
statistics in the world, a country with an unquenchable
thirst for the bizarre, the cruel, and the terrible,
would provide the perfect last refuge for him. Blofeld
must have gone off his head, but with a monstrous, calculating
madness—the madness of the genius he undoubtedly
was. And the whole demoniac concept was on Blofeld’s
usual grand scale—the scale of a Caligula, of a Nero,
of a Hitler, of any other great enemy of mankind. The
speed of execution was breathtaking, the expenditure fabulous,
the planning, down to the use of the Black Dragon
Society, meticulous, and the cover as impeccable as the Piz
Gloria Clinic, which, less than a year before, Bond had
helped to destroy utterly. And now the two enemies were
lined up again, but this time David was spurred on to kill
his Goliath not by duty but by blood feud! And with
what weapons? Nothing but his bare hands, a two-inch
pocket knife and a thin chain of steel. Well, similar weapons
had served him before. Surprise would be the determining
factor. Bond added a pair of black flippers to his
equipment, a small supply of pemmican-like meat, benzedrine
tablets, a plastic flask of water. Then he was ready.</p>

<p class="pindent">They motored down the main street to where the police
launch was waiting at the jetty and set off at a good
twenty knots across the beautiful bay and round the headland
into the Sea of Genkai. Tiger produced sandwiches
and a flask of <span class="it">saké</span> for each of them, and they ate their
luncheon as the jagged green coast with its sandy beaches
passed slowly by to port. Tiger pointed out a distant dot
on the horizon. “Kuro Island,” he said. “Cheer up, Bondo-san!
You seem preoccupied. Think of all those beautiful
naked women you will soon be swimming with! And this
Japanese Greta Garbo with whom you will be passing the
nights!”</p>

<p class="pindent">“And the sharks who will already be gathering at the
news of my swim to the castle!”</p>

<p class="pindent">“If they do not eat the Ama, why should they eat a bit
of tough Englishman? Look at the two fish eagles circling!
That is an excellent augury. One alone would have been
less propitious. Four would have been disastrous, for with
us four is the same as your thirteen—the worst number
of all. But, Bondo-san, does it not amuse you to think of
that foolish dragon dozing all unsuspecting in his castle
while St. George comes silently riding towards his lair
across the waves? It would make the subject for a most
entertaining Japanese print.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You’ve got a funny sense of humour, Tiger.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It is merely different from yours. Most of our funny
stories involve death or disaster. I am not a ‘picture-daddy’—a
professional story-teller—but I will tell you my favourite.
It concerns the young girl who comes to the toll
bridge. She tosses one sen, a very small piece of money,
to the watchman and walks on. The watchman calls after
her, ‘Hey! You know that the toll for crossing the bridge
is two sen.’ The girl answers, ‘But I do not intend to cross
the bridge. I intend only to go halfway and then throw
myself into the river.’ ” Tiger laughed uproariously.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled politely. “I must save that one up for London.
They’ll split their sides over it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The small speck on the horizon grew larger and soon
revealed itself as a horned island about five miles in circumference
with steep cliffs and a small harbour facing
north. On the mainland, Doctor Shatterhand’s small peninsula
reached out into the sea, and the fortress-like black
wall soared up out of the breaking waves. Above it were
the tops of trees, and behind them, in the distance, the
winged roof of the topmost storey of the castle broke the
sky-line. The formidable silhouette reminded Bond vaguely
of photographs of Alcatraz taken from sea-level. He shivered
slightly at the thought of the night’s swim across the
half-mile channel and of the black spider that would then
scale those soaring fortifications. Ah well! He turned his
attention back to Kuro Island.</p>

<p class="pindent">It appeared to be made of black volcanic rock, but there
was much green vegetation right up to the summit of a
small peak on which there was some kind of a stone beacon.
When they rounded the headland that formed one arm
of the bay, a crowded little village and a jetty appeared.
Out to sea, thirty or more rowing boats were scattered,
and there was the occasional glint of pink flesh in the sunlight.
Naked children were playing among the big smooth
black boulders that tumbled like bathing hippos along the
shore-line, and there were green nets hung up to dry. It
was a pretty scene, with the delicate remoteness, the fairyland
quality, of small fishing communities all the world
over. Bond took an immediate liking to the place, as if he
was arriving at a destination that had been waiting for him
and that would be friendly and welcoming.</p>

<p class="pindent">A group of village elders, grave, gnarled old men with
the serious expressions of simple people on important occasions,
led by the Shinto priest, was on the jetty to welcome
them. The priest was in ceremonial robes, a dark red three-quarter-length
kimono with vast hanging sleeves, a turquoise
skirt in broad pleats and the traditional shining
black hat in the shape of a blunt cone. He was a man of
simple dignity and considerable presence, middle-aged,
with a round face and round spectacles and a pursed,
judging mouth. His shrewd eyes took them in one by one
as they came ashore, but they rested longest on Bond.
Superintendent Ando was greeted with friendship as well
as respect. This was part of his parish, and he was the
ultimate source of all fishing permits, reflected Bond ungraciously,
but he had to admit that the deference of the
bows was not exaggerated and that he was lucky in his
ambassador. They proceeded up the cobbled path of the
main street to the priest’s house, a modest weather-beaten
affair of stone and carpentered drift-wood. They entered
and sat on the spotless polished wood floor in an arc in
front of the priest, and the superintendent made a long
speech punctuated by serious <span class="it">Hai’s</span> and <span class="it">Ah, so desu ka’s</span>
from the priest, who occasionally let his wise eyes rest
thoughtfully on Bond. He made a short speech in return,
to which the superintendent and Tiger listened with
deference. Tiger replied, and the business of the meeting
was over save for the inevitable tea.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond asked Tiger how his presence and mission had been
explained. Tiger said that it would have been of no use
lying to the priest, who was a shrewd man, so he had been
told most of the truth. The priest had expressed regret
that such extreme measures were contemplated, but he
agreed that the castle across the sea was a most evil place
and its owner a man in league with the devil. In the circumstances,
he would give the project his blessing, and
James Bond would be allowed to stay on the island for the
minimum time necessary to accomplish his mission.</p>

<p class="pindent">The priest would invite the Suzuki family to accord him
an honourable welcome. Bond would be explained away to
the elders as a famous <span class="it">gaijin</span> anthropologist who had come
to study the Ama way of life. Bond should therefore study
it, but the priest requested that Bond should behave in a
sincere manner. “Which means,” explained Tiger with a
malicious grin, “that you are not to go to bed with the
girls.”</p>

<p class="pindent">In the evening, they walked back to the jetty. The sea
was a dark slate colour and mirror-calm. The little boats,
bedecked with coloured flags which meant that it had
been an exceptional day’s fishing, were winging their way
back. The entire population of Kuro, perhaps two hundred
souls, was lined up along the shore to greet the heroines
of the day, the older people holding carefully folded
shawls and blankets to warm up the girls on their way to
their homes where, according to Tiger, they would be
given hot basin-baths to get back their circulation and
remove all traces of salt. It was now five o’clock. They
would be asleep by eight, said Tiger, and out again with
the dawn. Tiger was sympathetic. “You will have to adjust
your hours, Bondo-san. And your way of life. The Ama
live very frugally, very cheaply, for their earnings are
small—no more than the price of sparrows’ tears, as we
say. And for heaven’s sake be very polite to the parents,
particularly the father. As for Kissy . . .” He left the
sentence hanging in the air.</p>

<p class="pindent">Eager hands reached for each boat and, with happy
shouts, pulled it up on the black pebbles. Big wooden tubs
were lifted out and rushed up the beach to a kind of
rickety market where, according to Tiger, the <span class="it">awabi</span> were
graded and priced. Meanwhile, the chattering, smiling girls
waded in through the shallows and cast modestly appraising
glances at the three mainland strangers on the jetty.</p>

<p class="pindent">To Bond, they all seemed beautiful and gay in the soft
evening light—the proud, rather coarse-nippled breasts,
the gleaming muscled buttocks, cleft by the black cord
that held in place the frontal triangle of black cotton, the
powerful thong round the waist with its string of oval
lead weights, through which was stuck an angular steel
pick, the white rag round the tumbled hair, and, below,
the laughing dark eyes and lips that were happy with the
luck of the day. At that moment, it all seemed to Bond
as the world, as life, should be, and he felt ashamed of his
city-slicker appearance, let alone the black designs it concealed.</p>

<p class="pindent">One girl, rather taller than the rest, seemed to pay no
attention to the men on the jetty or to the police launch
riding beside it. She was the centre of a crowd of laughing
girls as she waded with a rather long, perhaps studied,
stride over the shiny black pebbles and up the beach. She
flung back a remark at her companions, and they giggled,
putting their hands up to their mouths. Then a wizened
old woman held out a coarse brown blanket to her and she
wrapped it round herself and the group dispersed.</p>

<p class="pindent">The couple, the old woman and the young one, walked
up the beach to the market. The young one talked excitedly.
The old one paid attention and nodded. The priest
was waiting for them. They bowed very low. He talked to
them, and they listened with humility, casting occasional
glances towards the group on the jetty. The tall girl drew
her blanket more closely round her. James Bond had
guessed it already. Now he knew. This was Kissy Suzuki.</p>

<p class="pindent">The three people, the splendidly attired priest, the
walnut-faced old fisherwoman, and the tall naked girl
wrapped in her drab blanket came along the jetty, the
girl hanging back. In a curious way they were a homogeneous
trio, and the priest might have been the father. The
women stopped, and the priest came forward. He bowed
to Bond and addressed him. Tiger translated: “He says
that the father and mother of Kissy Suzuki would be honoured
to receive you in their humble abode for whose
poverty they apologize. They regret that they are not
accustomed to Western ways, but their daughter is proficient
in English as a result of her work in America and
will endeavour to convey your wishes to them. The priest
asks if you can row a boat. The father, who previously
rowed for his daughter, is stricken with rheumatism. It
would be of great assistance to the family if you would
deign to take his place.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond bowed. He said, “Please convey to his reverence
that I am most grateful for his intercession on my behalf.
I would be most honoured to have a place to lay my head
in the home of Suzuki-san. My needs are very modest and
I greatly enjoy the Japanese way of life. I would be most
pleased to row the family boat or help the household in
any other way.” He added, sotto voce, “Tiger, I may need
these people’s help when the time comes. Particularly the
girl’s. How much can I tell her?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger said softly, “Use your discretion. The priest knows,
therefore the girl can know. She will not spread it abroad.
And now come forward and let the priest introduce you.
Don’t forget that your name here is Taro, which means
‘first son,’ Todoroki, which means ‘thunder.’ The priest
is not interested in your real name. I have said that this is
an approximation of your English name. It doesn’t matter.
Nobody will care. But you must try to assume some semblance
of a Japanese personality for when you get to the
other side. This name is on your identity card and on your
miner’s union card from the coal-mines of Fukuoka. You
need not bother with these things here, for you are among
friends. On the other side, if you are caught, you will show
the card that says you are deaf and dumb. All right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger talked to the priest, and Bond was led forward to
the two women. He bowed low to the mother, but he
remembered not to bow too low as she was only a woman,
and then he turned to the girl.</p>

<p class="pindent">She laughed gaily. She didn’t titter or giggle, she actually
laughed. She said, “You don’t have to bow to me, and I
shall never bow to you.” She held out her hand. “How do
you do. My name is Kissy Suzuki.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The hand was ice-cold. Bond said, “My name is Taro
Todoroki, and I am sorry to have kept you here so long.
You are cold and you ought to go and have your hot bath.
It is very kind of your family to accept me as your guest,
but I do not want to be an imposition. Are you sure it’s
all right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Whatever the <span class="it">kannushi-san</span>, the priest, says is all right.
And I have been cold before. When you have finished with
your distinguished friends, my mother and I will be happy
to lead you to our house. I hope you are good at peeling
potatoes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was delighted. Thank God for a straightforward
girl at last! No more bowing and hissing! He said, “I took
a degree in it. And I am strong and willing and I don’t
snore. What time do we take out the boat?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“About five-thirty. When the sun comes up. Perhaps
you will bring me good luck. The <span class="it">awabi</span> shells are not easy
to find. We had a lucky day today, and I earned about
thirty dollars, but it is not always so.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I don’t reckon in dollars. Let’s say ten pounds.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Aren’t Englishmen the same as Americans? Isn’t the
money the same?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Very alike, but totally different.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Is that so?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You mean ‘<span class="it">Ah, so desu ka?</span>’ ”</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl laughed. “You have been well trained by the
important man from Tokyo. Perhaps you will now say
good-bye to him and we can go home. It is at the other
end of the village.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The priest, the superintendent, and Tiger had been talking
together, ostensibly paying no attention to Bond and
the girl. The mother had been standing humbly, but with
shrewd eyes, watching every expression on the two faces.
Bond now bowed again to her and went back to the group
of men.</p>

<p class="pindent">Farewells were brief. Dusk was creeping up over the sea,
and the orange ball of the sun had already lost its brilliance
in the evening haze. The engine of the police boat had been
started up, and its exhaust bubbled softly. Bond thanked
the superintendent and was wished good fortune in his
honourable endeavours. Tiger looked serious. He took
Bond’s hand in both of his, an unusual gesture for a
Japanese. He said, “Bondo-san, I am certain you will succeed,
so I will not wish you luck. Nor will I say ‘<span class="it">sayōnara</span>,’
farewell. I will simply say a quiet ‘<span class="it">banzai!</span>’ to you and give
you this little <span class="it">presento</span> in case the gods frown upon your
venture and, through no fault of yours, things go wrong,
very wrong.” He took out a little box and gave it to Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">The box rattled. Bond opened it. Inside was one long
brownish pill. Bond laughed. He gave it back to Tiger and
said, “No thanks, Tiger. As Basshō said, or almost said,
‘You only live twice.’ If my second life comes up, I would
rather look it in the face and not turn my back on it. But
thanks, and thanks for everything. Those live lobsters were
really delicious. I shall now look forward to eating plenty
of seaweed while I’m here. So long! See you in about a
week.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger got down into the boat, and the engine revved up.
As the boat took the swell at the entrance to the harbour,
Tiger raised a hand and brought it swiftly down with a
chopping motion, and then the boat was round the sea-wall
and out of sight.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned away. The priest had gone. Kissy Suzuki
said impatiently, “Come along, Todoroki-san. The <span class="it">kannushi-san</span>
says I am to treat you as a comrade, as an equal.
But give me one of those two little bags to carry. For the
sake of the villagers who will be watching inquisitively,
we will wear the Oriental face in public.”</p>

<p class="pindent">And the tall man with the dark face, cropped hair, and
slanting eyebrows, the tall girl, and the old woman walked
off along the shore with their angular Japanese shadows
preceding them across the smooth black boulders.</p>
