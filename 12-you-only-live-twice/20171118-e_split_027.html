<h2 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_41"><span class="calibre1">The Question Room</span></h2>

<p class="line8"><span class="sc">There were now</span> ten guards in the room. They stood
lined up against the wall behind Kono. They were all armed
with their long staves. Kono fired an order at one of them.
The man left his stave in an angle of the wall and came
forward. He was a great box-like man with a totally bald,
shining head like a ripe fruit and hands like hams. He took
up his position in front of Bond, his legs straddled for balance
and his lips drawn back in a snarling smile of broken
black teeth. Then he swung his right hand sideways at
Bond’s head and slapped him with tremendous force exactly
on the bruise of Bond’s fall. Bond’s head exploded
with fire. Then the left hand came at him, and Bond rocked
sideways. Through a mist of blood he could see Blofeld and
his woman. Blofeld was merely interested, as a scientist, but
the woman’s lips were parted and wet.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took ten blows and knew that he must act while
he still had the purpose and the strength. The straddled
legs offered the perfect target. So long as the man had not
practised the <span class="it">sumo</span> trick! Through a haze, Bond took aim
and, as another giant blow was on its way, kicked upwards
with every ounce of force left to him. His foot slammed
home. The man gave an animal scream and crashed to the
ground, clasping himself and rolling from side to side in
agony. The guards made a concerted rush forward, their
staves lifted, and Kono had his gun out. Bond leaped for
the protection of a tall chair, picked it up, and hurled it at
the snarling pack of guards. One of the legs caught a man
in the teeth, and there was the sound of splintering bone.
The man went down clutching his face.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Halt!” It was the Hitlerian scream Bond had heard
before. The men stood stock still and lowered their staves.
“Kono. Remove those men.” Blofeld pointed down at the
two casualties. “And punish Kazama for his incompetence.
Get new teeth for the other one. And enough of this. The
man will not speak with ordinary methods. If he can hear,
he will not withstand the pressure of the Question Room.
Take him there. The rest of the guards can wait in the
audience chamber. Also! Marsch!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Kono fired off orders to which the guards reacted at the
double. Then Kono gestured to Bond with his gun, opened
a small doorway beside the bookcase, and pointed down a
narrow stone passage. Now what? Bond licked the blood
from the corners of his mouth. He was near the end of his
tether. Pressure? He couldn’t stand much more of it. And
what was this Question Room? He mentally shrugged.
There might still be a chance to get at Blofeld’s throat.
If only he could take that one with him! He went ahead
down the passage, was deaf to the order from Kono to open
the rough door at the end, had it opened for him by the
guard while the pistol pressed into his spine, and walked
forward into a bizarre room of roughly hewn stone that
was very hot and stank disgustingly of sulphur.</p>

<p class="pindent">Blofeld and the woman entered, the door was closed,
and they took their places in two wooden arm-chairs
beneath an oil lamp and a large kitchen clock whose only
unusual feature was that, at each quarter, the figures were
underlined in red. The hands stood at just after eleven,
and now, with a loud iron tick, the minute hand dropped
one span. Kono gestured for Bond to advance the twelve
paces to the far end of the room, where there was a raised
stone pedestal-seat with arms. It dripped with drying grey
mud; there was the same volcanic filth on the floor all
round it. Above the stone seat, in the ceiling, there was a
wide circular opening through which Bond could see a
patch of dark sky and stars. Kono’s rubber boots squelched
after him, and Bond was gestured to sit down on the
stone throne. In the centre of the seat, there was a large
round hole. Bond did as he was told, his skin flinching at
the hot sticky surface of the mud. He rested his forearms
wearily on the stone arms of the throne and waited, his
belly crawling with the knowledge of what this was all
about.</p>

<p class="pindent">Blofeld spoke from the other end of the room. He spoke
in English. He said, in a loud voice that boomed round the
naked walls, “Commander Bond, or number 007 in the
British Secret Service if you prefer it, this is the Question
Room, a device of my invention that has the almost inevitable
effect of making silent people talk. As you know, this
property is highly volcanic. You are now sitting directly
above a geyser that throws mud, at a heat of around one
thousand degrees Centigrade, a distance of approximately
one hundred feet into the air. Your body is now at an
elevation of approximately fifty feet directly above its
source. I had the whimsical notion to canalize this geyser
up a stone funnel above which you now sit. This is what is
known as a periodic geyser. This particular example is regulated
to erupt volcanically at exactly the fifteenth minute
in every hour.” Blofeld looked behind him and turned
back. “You will therefore observe that you have exactly
eleven minutes before the next eruption. If you cannot
hear me, or the translation that will follow, if you are a
deaf-and-dumb Japanese as you maintain, you will not
move from that chair and, at the fifteenth minute past
eleven, you will suffer a most dreadful death by the incineration
of your lower body. If, on the other hand, you
leave the seat before the death moment, you will have
demonstrated that you can hear and understand and you
will then be put to further tortures which will inevitably
make you answer my questions. These questions will seek
to confirm your identity, how you come to be here, who
sent you and with what purpose, and how many people
are involved in the conspiracy. You understand? You
would not prefer to give up this play-acting? Very well.
On the off-chance that your papers are perhaps partially
correct, my chief guard will now briefly explain the purpose
of this room in the Japanese language.” He turned to
the guard. “Kono, sag’ ihm auf japanisch den Zweck dieses
Zimmers.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Kono had taken up his position by the door. He now
harangued Bond in sharp Japanese sentences. Bond paid no
attention. He concentrated on regaining his strength. He
sat relaxed and gazed nonchalantly round the room. He
had remembered the final “hell” at Beppu, and he was
looking for something. Ah yes! There it was! A small
wooden box in the corner to the right of his throne. There
was no keyhole to it. Inside that box would undoubtedly
be the regulating valve for the geyser. Could that bit of
knowledge be put to some use? Bond tucked it away and
racked his tired brain for some kind of a plan. If only the
agonizing pulse in his head would stop. He rested his elbows
on his knees and gently lowered his bruised face into his
hands. At least that guard would now be in even worse
agony than he!</p>

<p class="pindent">Kono stopped talking. The clock uttered a deep iron
tick.</p>

<p class="pindent">It ticked nine times more. Bond looked up at the black-and-white
clockwork face. It said 11.14. A deep angry
grumble sounded from down beneath him. It was followed
by a hard buffet of very hot breath. Bond got to his feet
and walked slowly away from the stinking stone vent until
he reached the area of the floor that was not wet with mud.
Then he turned and watched. The grumble had become a
far-away roar. The roar became a deep howl that swelled
up into the room like an express train coming out of a
tunnel. Then there was a mighty explosion, and a solid
jet of grey mud shot like a gleaming grey piston out of the
hole Bond had just left and exactly penetrated the wide
aperture in the ceiling. The jet continued, absolutely solid,
for perhaps half a second, and searing heat filled the room
so that Bond had to wipe the sweat from his forehead. Then
the grey pillar collapsed back into the hole, and mud pattered
on to the roof of the place and splashed down into the
room in great steaming gobbets. A deep bubbling and
burping came up the pipe, and the room steamed. The
stench of sulphur was sickening. In the total silence that
followed, the tick of the clock to 11.16 was as loud as a
gong-stroke.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned and faced the couple under the clock. He
said cheerfully, “Well, Blofeld, you mad bastard. I’ll admit
that your effects man down below knows his stuff. Now
bring on the twelve she-devils, and if they’re all as beautiful
as Fräulein Bunt, we’ll get Noël Coward to put it to
music and have it on Broadway by Christmas. How about
it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Blofeld turned to Irma Bunt. “My dear girl, you were
right! It is indeed the same Britisher. Remind me to buy
you another string of the excellent Mr. Mikimoto’s grey
pearls. And now let us be finished with this man once and
for all. It is beyond our bedtime.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes indeed, lieber Ernst. But first he must speak.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course, Irmchen. But that can be quickly done. We
have already broken his first reserves. The second line of
defence will be routine. Come!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Back up the stone passage! Back into the library! Irma
Bunt back to her petit point, Blofeld back to his stance by
the mantelpiece, his hand resting lightly on the boss of his
great sword. It was just as if they had returned after taking
part in some gracious after-dinner entertainment: a game
of billiards, a look at the stamp albums, a dull quarter of
an hour with the home movies. Bond decided: to hell with
the Fukuoka miner! There was a writing-desk next to the
bookshelves. He pulled out its chair and sat down. There
were cigarettes and matches. He lit up and sat back, inhaling
luxuriously. Might as well make oneself comfortable
before one went for the Big Sleep! He tapped his ash
on to the carpet and crossed one knee over the other.</p>

<p class="pindent">Blofeld pointed to the pile of Bond’s possessions on the
floor. “Kono, take those away. I will examine them later.
And you can wait with the guards in the outer hall. Prepare
the blowlamp and the electrical machine for further
examination in case it should be necessary.” He turned to
Bond. “And now—talk and you will receive an honourable
and quick death by the sword. Have no misgivings. I am
expert with it and it is razor-sharp. If you do not talk, you
will die slowly and horribly and you will talk just the same.
You know from your profession that this is so. There is a
degree of prolonged suffering that no human can withstand.
Well?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said easily, “Blofeld, you were never stupid. Many
people in London and Tokyo know of my presence here
tonight. At this moment, you might argue your way out
of a capital charge. You have a lot of money and you could
engage the best lawyers. But if you kill me, you will certainly
die.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Mister Bond, you are not telling the truth. I know the
ways of officialdom as well as you do. Therefore I dismiss
your story in its entirety and without hesitation. If my
presence here was officially known, a small army of policemen
would have been sent to arrest me. And they would
have been accompanied by a senior member of the C.I.A.
on whose <span class="sc">wanted</span> list I certainly feature. This is an American
sphere of influence. You might have been allowed to
interview me subsequent to my arrest, but an Englishman
would not have featured in the initial police action.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Who said this was police action? When, in England, I
heard rumours about this place, I thought the whole
project smelled of you. I obtained permission to come and
have a look. But my whereabouts is known, and retribution
will result if I do not return.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That does not follow, Mister Bond. There will be no
trace of your ever having seen me, no trace of your entry
into the property. I happen to have certain information
that fits in with your presence here. One of my agents
recently reported that the head of the Japanese Secret
Service, a certain Tanaka, came down in this direction
accompanied by a foreigner dressed as a Japanese. I now
see that your appearance tallies with my agent’s description.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Where is this man? I would like to question him.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“He is not available.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Very convenient.”</p>

<p class="pindent">A red fire began to burn deep in the black pools of Blofeld’s
eyes. “You forget that it is not I who am being interrogated,
Mister Bond. It is you. Now, I happen to know
all about this Tanaka. He is a totally ruthless man, and I
will hazard a guess that fits the facts and that is made almost
into a certitude by your crude evasions. This man
Tanaka has already lost one senior agent whom he sent
down here to investigate me. You were available, on some
business concerned with your profession, perhaps, and,
for a consideration, or in exchange for a favour, you
agreed to come here and kill me, thus tidying up a situation
which is causing some embarrassment to the Japanese
government. I do not know or care when you learned that
Doctor Guntram Shatterhand was in fact Ernst Stavro
Blofeld. You have your private reasons for wanting to kill
me, and I have absolutely no doubt that you kept your
knowledge to yourself and passed it on to no one for fear
that the official action I have described would take the
place of your private plans for revenge.” Blofeld paused.
He said softly, “I have one of the greatest brains in the
world, Mister Bond. Have you anything to say in reply?
As the Americans say, ‘It had better be good.’ ”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took another cigarette and lit it. He said composedly,
“I stick to the truth, Blofeld. If anything happens
to me, you, and probably the woman as an accessory,
will be dead by Christmas.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“All right, Mister Bond. But I am so sure of my facts
that I am now going to kill you with my own hands and
dispose of your body without more ado. On reflection, I
would rather do it myself than have it done slowly by the
guards. You have been a thorn in my flesh for too long.
The account I have to settle with you is a personal one.
Have you ever heard the Japanese expression <span class="it">kirisute
gomen</span>?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond groaned. “Spare me the Lafcadio Hearn, Blofeld!”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It dates from the time of the <span class="it">samurai</span>. It means literally
‘killing and going away.’ If a low person hindered the
<span class="it">samurai’s</span> passage along the road or failed to show him
proper respect, the <span class="it">samurai</span> was within his rights to lop off
the man’s head. I regard myself as a latter-day <span class="it">samurai</span>.
My fine sword has not yet been blooded. Yours will be an
admirable head to cut its teeth on.” He turned to Irma
Bunt. “You agree, mein Liebchen?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The square wardress face looked up from its petit point.
“But of course, lieber Ernst. What you decide is always
correct. But be careful. This animal is dangerous.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You forget, mein Liebchen. Since last January he has
ceased to be an animal. By a simple stroke of surgery on the
woman he loved, I reduced him to human dimensions.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The dominant horrific figure stood away from the
mantelpiece and took up his sword.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Let me show you.”</p>
