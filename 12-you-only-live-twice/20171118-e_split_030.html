<p class="line8"><span class="sc">When Kissy saw</span> the figure, black-winged in its kimono,
crash down into the sea, she sensed that it was her man,
and she covered the two hundred yards from the base of
the wall as fast as she had ever swum in her life. The tremendous
impact with the water had at first knocked all
the wind out of Bond, but the will to live, so nearly extinguished
by the searing pain in his head, was revived by
the new but recognizable enemy of the sea, and when
Kissy got to him, he was struggling to free himself from
the kimono.</p>

<p class="pindent">At first, he thought she was Blofeld and tried to strike
out at her.</p>

<p class="pindent">“It’s Kissy,” she said urgently, “Kissy Suzuki! Don’t you
remember?”</p>

<p class="pindent">He didn’t. He had no recollection of anything in the
world but the face of his enemy and of the desperate urge
to smash it. But his strength was going, and finally, cursing
feebly, he allowed her to man-handle him out of the
kimono and paid heed to the voice that pleaded with him.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Now follow me, Taro-san. When you get tired, I will
pull you with me. We are all trained in such rescue work.”</p>

<p class="pindent">But, when she started off, Bond didn’t follow her. Instead,
he swam feebly round and round like a wounded
animal, in ever-increasing circles. She almost wept. What
had happened to him? What had they done to him at the
Castle of Death? Finally she stopped him and talked softly
to him, and he docilely allowed her to put her arms under
his armpits; then, with his head cradled between her
breasts, she set off with the traditional backward leg-stroke.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was an amazing swim for a girl—half a mile with
currents to contend with and only the moon and an occasional
glance over her shoulder to give her a bearing,
but she achieved it and finally hauled Bond out of the
water in her little cove and collapsed on the flat stones
beside him.</p>

<p class="pindent">She was awoken by a groan from Bond. He had been
quietly sick and now sat with his head in his hands, looking
blankly out to sea with the glazed eyes of a sleep-walker.
When Kissy put an arm round his shoulders, he
turned vaguely towards her. “Who are you? How did I
get here? What is this place?” He examined her more carefully.
“You’re very pretty.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Kissy looked at him keenly. She said, and a sudden plan
of great glory blazed across her mind, “You cannot remember
anything? You do not remember who you are
and where you came from?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond passed a hand across his forehead, squeezed his
eyes. “Nothing,” he said wearily. “Nothing except a man’s
face. I think he was dead. I think he was a bad man. What
is your name? You must tell me everything.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“My name is Kissy Suzuki and you are my lover. Your
name is Taro Todoroki. We live on this island and go fishing
together. It is a very good life. But can you walk a
little? I must take you to where you live and get you some
food and a doctor to see you. You have a terrible wound
on the side of your head, and there is a cut on your ribs.
You must have fallen while you were climbing the cliffs
after seagulls’ eggs.” She stood up and held out her hands.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took them and staggered to his feet. She held him
by the hand and gently guided him along the path towards
the Suzuki house. But she passed it and went on
and up to the grove of dwarf maples and camellia bushes.
She led him behind the Shinto shrine and into the cave.
It was large, and the earth floor was dry. She said, “This
is where you live. I live here with you. I had put away
our bed things. I will go and fetch them and some food.
Now lie down, my beloved, and rest, and I will look after
you. You are ill, but the doctor will make you well again.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond did as he was told and was instantly asleep, the
pain-free side of his head cradled on his arm.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kissy ran off down the mountain, her heart singing.
There was much to be done, much to be arranged, but now
she had got her man back she was desperately determined
to keep him.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was almost dawn, and her parents were awake. She
whispered to them excitedly as she went about warming
some milk and putting together a bundle of <span class="it">futon</span>, her
father’s best kimono, and a selection of Bond’s washing
things—nothing to remind him of his past. Her parents
were used to her whims and her independence. Her father
merely commented mildly that it would be all right if the
<span class="it">kannushi-san</span> gave his blessing. Then, having washed the
salt off herself and dressed in her own simple brown kimono,
she scampered off up the hill to the cave.</p>

<p class="pindent">Later, the Shinto priest received her gravely. He almost
seemed to be expecting her. He held up his hand and spoke
to the kneeling figure. “Kissy-chan, I know what I know.
The spawn of the devil is dead. So is his wife. The Castle
of Death has been totally destroyed. These things were
brought about as the Six Guardians foretold, by the man
from across the sea. Where is he now?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“In the cave behind the shrine, <span class="it">kannushi-san</span>. He is
gravely wounded. I love him. I wish to keep him and care
for him. He remembers nothing of the past. I wish it to
remain so, so that we may marry and he may become a
son of Kuro for all time.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That will not be possible, my daughter. In due course
he will recover and go off across the world to where he
came from. And there will be official inquiries for him,
from Fukuoka, perhaps even from Tokyo, for he is surely
a man of renown in his own country.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“But <span class="it">kannushi-san</span>, if you so instruct the elders of Kuro,
they will show these people <span class="it">shiran-kao</span>, they will say they
know nothing, that this man Todoroki left, swimming for
the mainland, and has not been heard of since. Then the
people will go away. All I want to do is to care for him
and keep him for myself as long as I can. If the day comes
when he wishes to leave, I will not hinder him. I will help
him. He was happy here fishing with me and my David-bird.
He told me so. When he recovers, I will see that he
continues to be happy. Should not Kuro cherish and honour
this hero who was brought to us by the gods? Would
not the Six Guardians wish to keep him for a while? And
have I not earned some small token for my humble efforts
to help Todoroki-san and save his life?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The priest sat silent for a while with his eyes closed.
Then he looked down at the pleading face at his feet. He
smiled. “I will do what is possible, Kissy-chan. And now
bring the doctor to me and then take him up to the cave
so that he can tend this man’s wounds. Then I will speak
to the elders. But for many weeks you must be very discreet,
and the <span class="it">gaijin</span> must not show himself. When all is
quiet again, he may move back into the house of your
parents and allow himself to be seen.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor knelt beside Bond in the cave and spread
out on the ground a large map of the human head with
the sections marked with figures and ideograms. His gentle
fingers probed Bond’s wound for signs of fracture, while
Kissy knelt beside him and held one of Bond’s sweating
hands in both of hers. The doctor bent forward and, lifting
the eyelids one by one, gazed deeply into the glazed
eyes through a large reading-glass. On his instructions,
Kissy ran for boiling water, and the doctor proceeded to
clean the cut made by the bullet across the terrible swelling
of the first wound caused by Bond’s crash into the
oubliette. Then he tapped sulpha dust into the wound and
bound up the head neatly and expertly, put surgical plaster
over the cut across the ribs, and stood up and took
Kissy outside the cave. “He will live,” he said, “but it may
be months, even years before he regains his memory. It is
particularly the temporal lobe of his brain, where the memory
is stored, that has been damaged. For this, much education
will be necessary. You will endeavour all the time
to remind him about past things and places. Then isolated
facts that he will recognize will turn into chains of association.
He should undoubtedly be taken to Fukuoka for
an X-ray, but I think there is no fracture and in any case
the <span class="it">kannushi-san</span> has ordained that he is to remain under
your care and his presence on the island to be kept secret.
I shall of course observe the instructions of the honourable
<span class="it">kannushi-san</span> and only visit him by different routes
and at night. But there is much you will have to attend
to, for he must not be moved in any way for at least a
week. Now listen carefully,” said the doctor, and he gave
her minute instructions which covered every aspect of feeding
and nursing and left her to carry them out.</p>

<p class="pindent">And so the days ran into weeks and the police came
again and again from Fukuoka, and the official called Tanaka
came from Tokyo, and later a huge man who said
he was from Australia arrived, and he was the most difficult
of all for Kissy to shake off. But the face of <span class="it">shiran-kao</span>
remained of stone, and the island of Kuro kept its
secret. James Bond’s body gradually mended, and Kissy
took him out for walks at night. They also went for an
occasional swim in the cove, where they played with David,
and she told him all the history of the Ama and of
Kuro and expertly parried all his questions about the world
outside the island.</p>

<p class="pindent">Winter came, and the Ama had to stay ashore and turn
their hands to mending nets and boats and working on
the small-holdings on the mountain side. Bond came back
into the house and made himself useful with carpentry
and odd jobs and with learning Japanese from Kissy. The
glazed look went from his eyes, but they remained remote
and far-away, and every night he was puzzled by dreams
of a quite different world of white people and big cities
and half-remembered faces. But Kissy assured him that
these were just nightmares such as she had and that they
had no meaning, and gradually Bond came to accept the
little stone-and-wood house and the endless horizon of sea
as his finite world. Kissy was careful to keep him away
from the south coast of the island, dreading the day when
fishing would begin again at the end of May and he would
see the great black wall across the straits and memory
might come flooding back.</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor was surprised by Bond’s lack of progress and
resigned himself to the conclusion that Bond’s amnesia was
total, but soon there was no cause for further visits because
Bond’s physical health and his apparently complete
satisfaction with his lot showed that in every other respect
he was totally recovered.</p>

<p class="pindent">But there was one thing that greatly distressed Kissy.
From the first night in the cave she had shared Bond’s
<span class="it">futon</span>, and when he was well and back in the house, she
waited every night for him to make love to her. But while
he kissed her occasionally and often held her hand, his
body seemed totally unaware of her, however much she
pressed herself against him and even caressed him with her
hands. Had the wound made him impotent? She consulted
the doctor, but he said there could be no connection, although
it was just possible that he had forgotten how to
perform the act of love.</p>

<p class="pindent">So one day Kissy Suzuki announced that she was going
to take the weekly mail-boat to Fukuoka to do some shopping,
and in the big city, she found her way to the local
sex-shop, called The Happy Shop, that is a feature of all
self-respecting Japanese towns, and told her problem to the
wicked-looking old greybeard behind the innocent counter
containing nothing more viciously alluring than tonics and
contraceptives. He asked her if she possessed five thousand
yen, which is a lot of money, and when she said she did,
he locked the street door and invited her to the back of
the shop.</p>

<p class="pindent">The sex merchant bent down and pulled out from beneath
a bench what looked like a small wired rabbit-hutch.
As he put this on the bench, Kissy saw that it contained
four large toads on a bed of moss. Next he produced a
metal contraption that had the appearance of a hot-plate
with a small wire cage in the middle. He carefully lifted
out one of the toads and placed it inside the cage so that
it squatted on the metal surface. Then he hauled a large
car battery on to the bench, put it alongside the “hot-plate,”
and attached wires from one to the other. Then he
spoke some encouraging endearments to the toad and stood
back.</p>

<p class="pindent">The toad began to shiver slightly, and the crosses in its
dark red eyes blazed angrily at Kissy as if it knew it was
all her fault. The sex merchant, his head bent over the
little cage, watched anxiously and then rubbed his hands
with satisfaction as heavy beads of sweat broke out all
over the toad’s warty skin. He reached for an iron teaspoon
and a small phial, gently raised the wire cage, and
very carefully scraped the sweat-beads off the toad’s body
and dripped the result into the phial. When he had finished,
the phial contained about half a teaspoon of clear
liquid. He corked it up and handed it to Kissy, who held
it with reverence and great care as if it had been a fabulous
jewel. Then the sex merchant disconnected the wires
and put the toad, which seemed none the worse for its experience,
back in its hutch and closed the top.</p>

<p class="pindent">He turned to Kissy and bowed. “When this valuable
product is desired by a sincere customer, I always ask them
to witness the process of distillation. Otherwise they might
harbour the unworthy thought that the phial contained
only water from the tap. But you have now seen that this
preparation is the authentic sweat of a toad. It is produced
by giving the toad a mild electric shock. The toad suffered
only temporary discomfort, and it will be rewarded this
evening with an extra portion of flies or crickets. And
now,” he went to a cupboard and took out a small pillbox,
“here is powder of dried lizard. A combination of
the two, inserted in your lover’s food at the evening meal,
should prove infallible. However, to excite his mind as well
as his senses, for an extra thousand yen I can provide you
with a most excellent pillow-book.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What is a pillow-book?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The sex merchant went back to his cupboard and produced
a cheaply bound and printed paper book with a
plain cover. Kissy opened it. Her hand went to her mouth,
and she blushed furiously. But then, being a careful girl
who didn’t want to be cheated, she turned some more of
the pages. They all contained outrageously pornographic
close-up pictures, most faithfully engraved, of the love-act
portrayed from every possible aspect. “Very well,” she
whispered. She handed back the book. “Please wrap up
everything carefully.” She took out her purse and began
counting out the notes.</p>

<p class="pindent">Out in the shop, the wicked-faced old man handed her
the parcel and, bowing deeply, unlocked the door. Kissy
gave a perfunctory bob in return and darted out of the
shop and down the street as if she had just made a pact
with the devil. But by the time she went to catch the mail-boat
back to Kuro, she was hugging herself with excitement
and pleasure and making up a story to explain away
her acquisition of the book.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was waiting for her on the jetty. It was the first
day she had been away from him and he had missed her
painfully. They talked happily as they walked hand-in-hand
along the foreshore among the nets and boats, and
the people smiled to see them, but looked through them
instead of greeting them, for had not the priest decreed
that their <span class="it">gaijin</span> hero did not officially exist? And the
priest’s edict was final.</p>

<p class="pindent">Back at the house, Kissy went happily about preparing
a highly spiced dish of <span class="it">sukiyaki</span>, the national dish of beef
stew. This was not only a great treat, for they seldom ate
meat, but Kissy didn’t know if her love-potions had any
taste and it would be wise not to take any chances. When
it was ready, with a trembling hand, she poured the brown
powder and the liquid into Bond’s portion and stirred it
well. Then she brought the dishes in to where the family
awaited, squatting on the <span class="it">tatami</span> before the low table.</p>

<p class="pindent">She watched surreptitiously as Bond devoured every
scrap of his portion and wiped his plate clean with a pinch
of rice and then, after warm compliments on her cooking,
drank his tea and retired to their room. In the evenings,
he usually sat mending nets or fishing-lines before going
to bed. As she helped her mother wash up, she wondered
if he were doing so now!</p>

<p class="pindent">Kissy spent a long time doing her hair and making herself
pretty before, her heart beating like a captured bird,
she joined him.</p>

<p class="pindent">He looked up from the pillow-book and laughed. “Kissy,
where in God’s name did you get this?”</p>

<p class="pindent">She giggled. “Oh that! I forgot to tell you. Some dreadful
man tried to make up to me in one of the shops. He
pressed that into my hand and made an assignation for
this evening. I agreed just to get rid of him. It is what
we call a pillow-book. Lovers use them. Aren’t the pictures
exciting?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond threw off his kimono. He pointed to the soft <span class="it">futon</span>
on the floor. He said fiercely, “Kissy, take off your clothes
and lie down there. We’ll start at page one.”</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">Winter slid into spring, and fishing began again, but
now Kissy dived naked like the other girls and Bond and
the bird dived with her and there were good days and
bad days. But the sun shone steadily and the sea was blue
and wild irises covered the mountain side and everyone
made a great fuss as the sprinkling of cherry trees burst
into bloom. Kissy wondered what moment to choose to
tell Bond that she was going to have a baby and whether
he would then propose marriage to her.</p>

<p class="pindent">But one day, on the way down to the cove, Bond looked
preoccupied, and when he asked her to wait before they
put the boat out as he had something serious to talk to
her about, her heart leaped and she sat down beside him
on a flat rock and put her arms round him and waited.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took a crumpled piece of paper out of his pocket
and held it out to her; she shivered with fear and knew
what was coming. She took her arms from round him and
looked at the paper. It was one of the rough squares of
newspaper from the spike in the little lavatory. She always
tore these squares herself and discarded any that contained
words in English—just in case.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond pointed. “Kissy, what is this word ‘Vladivostok’?
What does it mean? It has some kind of a message for me.
I connect it with a very big country. I believe the country
is called Russia. Am I right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Kissy remembered her promise to the priest. She put her
face in her hands. “Yes, Taro-san. That is so.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond pressed his fists to his eyes and squeezed. “I have
a feeling that I have had much to do with this Russia, that
a lot of my past life was concerned with it. Could that
be possible? I long so terribly to know where I came from
before I came to Kuro. Will you help me, Kissy?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Kissy took her hands from her face and looked at him.
She said quietly, “Yes, I will help you, my beloved.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Then I must go to this place Vladivostok, and perhaps
it will awaken more memories and I can work my way
back from there.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“If you say so, my love. The mail-boat goes to Fukuoka
tomorrow. I will put you on a train there and give you
money and full directions. It is advertised that one can
go from the northern island, Hokkaido, to Sakhalin, which
is a part of Russia. Then you can no doubt make your
way to Vladivostok. It is a great port to the south of
Sakhalin. But you must take care, for the Russians are not
friendly people.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Surely they would do no harm to a fisherman from
Kuro?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Kissy’s heart choked her. She got up and walked slowly
down to the boat. She pushed the boat down the pebbles
into the water and waited, at her usual place in the stern,
for him to get in and for his knees to clasp hers as they
always did.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond took his place and unshipped the oars, and
the cormorant scrambled on board and perched imperiously
in the bows. Bond measured where the rest of the
fleet lay on the horizon and began to row.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kissy smiled into his eyes, and the sun shone on his
back; so far as James Bond was concerned, it was a beautiful
day just as all the other days had been—without a
cloud in the sky.</p>

<p class="pindent">But then, of course, he didn’t know that his name was
James Bond. And, compared with the blazing significance
to him of that single Russian word on the scrap of paper,
his life on Kuro, his love for Kissy Suzuki, were, in Tiger’s
phrase, of as little account as sparrows’ tears.</p>
