<p class="line8"><span class="sc">Tiger and Bond</span> stood in the shade of the avenue of giant
cryptomerias and observed the pilgrims, slung with cameras,
who were visiting the famous Outer Shrine of Ise, the
greatest temple to the creed of Shintoism. Tiger said, “All
right. You have observed these people and their actions.
They have been saying prayers to the sun goddess. Go and
say a prayer without drawing attention to yourself.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked over the raked path and through the great
wooden archway and joined the throng in front of the
shrine. Two priests, bizarre in their red kimonos and black
helmets, were watching. Bond bowed towards the shrine,
tossed a coin on to the wire netting designed to catch the
offerings, clapped his hands loudly, bent his head in an
attitude of prayer, clapped his hands again, bowed, and
walked out.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You did well,” said Tiger. “One of the priests barely
glanced at you. The public paid no attention. You should
perhaps have clapped your hands more loudly. It is to draw
the attention of the goddess and your ancestors to your
presence at the shrine. Then they will pay more attention
to your prayer. What prayer did you in fact make?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m afraid I didn’t make any, Tiger. I was concentrating
on remembering the right sequence of motions.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“The goddess will have noted that, Bondo-san. She will
help you to concentrate still more in the future. Now we
will go back to the car and proceed to witness another
interesting ceremony in which you will take part.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond groaned. In the parking place beyond the vast
<span class="it">torii</span> that guarded the entrance, char-à-bancs were disgorging
hordes of students while the conductresses shouted,
“<span class="it">Awri</span>, <span class="it">awri</span>, <span class="it">awri</span>” and blew whistles to help the drivers
of other char-à-bancs to back in. The giggling girls were
severely dressed in dark blue with black cotton stockings.
The youths wore the handsome, high-collared black uniform
of Japanese students. Tiger led the way through the
middle of the crowd. When they emerged Tiger looked
pleased. “Did you notice anything, Bondo-san?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Only a lot of pretty girls. Rather too young for me.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Wrong. Yesterday many of them would have stared and
giggled behind their hands and said ‘<span class="it">Gaijin!</span>’ Today you
were not recognized as a foreigner. Your appearance is one
thing, but your comportment has also improved. You
exude more self-confidence. You are more at home.” Tiger
gave his golden sunburst of a smile. “The Tanaka system.
It is not so foolish as you think.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Wadakin, on the road across the mountains to the
ancient capital of Kyoto, was a little upland hamlet without
distinction. Tiger gave decisive orders to the driver of
the hired car, and they arrived at a tall barn-like building
in a back street. There was a strong smell of cattle and
manure. The chief herdsman, as he turned out to be,
greeted them. He had the apple cheeks and wise kindly
eyes of his counterparts in Scotland and the Tyrol. Tiger
had a long conversation with him. The man looked at
Bond, and his eyes twinkled. He bowed perfunctorily and
led the way inside. It was cool out of the sun. There were
rows of stalls in which vastly fat brown cows lay chewing
the cud. A gay small dog was licking the muzzle of one
of them and being occasionally given a lick in return. The
herdsman lifted a barrier and said something to one of the
cows, which got unsteadily up on to legs that had become
spindly through lack of exercise. It ambled unsteadily out
into the sunshine and looked warily at Tiger and Bond.
The herdsman hauled out a crate of beer bottles. He
opened one and handed it to Bond. Tiger said peremptorily,
“Give it to the cow to drink.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took the bottle and walked boldly up to the cow,
who raised her head and opened her slavering jaws. Bond
thrust the bottle between them and poured. The cow
almost ate the bottle in its delight and ran its harsh tongue
gratefully over Bond’s hand. Bond stood his ground. He
was getting used to Tiger’s ploys by now, and he was determined
to show at any rate an approximation of the
<span class="it">kami-kaze</span> spirit whatever test Tiger put him to.</p>

<p class="pindent">The herdsman now handed Bond a bottle of what appeared
to be water. Tiger said, “This is <span class="it">shochu</span>. It is a very
raw gin. Fill your mouth with it and spray it over the
back of the cow and then massage it into the cow’s flesh.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond guessed that Tiger hoped he would swallow some
of the gin and choke. He closed his throat but lustily filled
his mouth with the stuff, compressed his lips, and blew
hard so that the vapour from the stuff would not go up
his nostrils. He wiped his hands across his lips that were
already stinging with the harsh spirit and scrubbed energetically
at the rough pelt. The cow bent her head in
ecstasy. . . . Bond stood back. “Now what?” he said
belligerently. “What’s the cow going to do for me?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger laughed and translated for the herdsman, who also
laughed and looked at Bond with some respect. Money
changed hands, and with much happy talk between Tiger
and the herdsman and final bows they got back into the
car and drove into the village, where they were welcomed
into a shuttered and discreet restaurant, polished, spotless,
and blessedly deserted. Tiger ordered, and they sat in
wonderful Western chairs at a real table while the usual
dimpling waitresses brought <span class="it">saké</span>. Bond swallowed down
his first flask at one long gulp to wash away the rasp of the
gin. He said to Tiger, “And now, what was that all about?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger looked pleased with himself. “You are about to
eat what it was all about—the finest, most succulent beef
in the world. Kobe beef, but of a grade you wouldn’t find
in the most expensive restaurant in Tokyo. This herd is
owned by a friend of mine. The herdsman was a good man,
was he not? He feeds each of his cows four pints of beer
a day and massages them with <span class="it">shochu</span> as you did. They
also receive a rich meal of oaten porridge. You like beef?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No,” said Bond stolidly. “As a matter of fact, I don’t.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That is unfortunate,” said Tiger, not looking as if it
were. “For what you are about to eat is the finest steak
that will be eaten today anywhere outside the Argentine.
And you have earned it. The herdsman was greatly impressed
by your sincere performance with his cow.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“And what does that prove?” said Bond sourly. “And
what honourable experience is awaiting me this afternoon?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The steak came. It was accompanied by various succulent
side-dishes, including a saucer of blood, which Bond
refused. But the meat could be cut with a fork and was
indeed without equal in Bond’s experience. Tiger, munching
with gusto, answered Bond’s question. “I am taking
you to one of the secret training establishments of my
service,” he said. “It is not far from here, in the mountains,
in an old fortified castle. It goes under the name of the
‘Central Mountaineering School.’ It arouses no comment
in the neighbourhood, which is just as well, since it is here
that my agents are trained in one of the arts most dreaded
in Japan—<span class="it">ninjutsu</span>, which is, literally, the art of stealth
or invisibility. All the men you will see have already
graduated in at least ten of the eighteen martial arts of
<span class="it">bushido</span>, or ‘ways of the warrior,’ and they are now learning
to be <span class="it">ninja</span>, or ‘stealers-in,’ which has for centuries
been part of the basic training of spies and assassins and
saboteurs. You will see men walk across the surface of
water, walk up walls and across ceilings, and you will be
shown equipment which makes it possible for them to
remain submerged under water for a full day. And many
other tricks besides. For, of course, apart from physical
dexterity, the <span class="it">ninja</span> were never the superhumans they were
built up to be in the popular imagination. But, nevertheless,
the secrets of <span class="it">ninjutsu</span> are still closely guarded today
and are the property of two main schools, the Iga and the
Togakure, from which my instructors are drawn. I think
you will be interested and perhaps learn something yourself
at this place. I have never approved of agents carrying
guns and other obvious weapons. In China, Korea, and
Oriental Russia, which are, so to speak, my main beats,
the possession of any offensive weapon on arrest would be
an obvious confession of guilt. My men are expected to
be able to kill without weapons. All they may carry is a
staff and a length of thin chain, which can be easily explained
away. You understand?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, that makes sense. We have a similar commando
training school for unarmed combat attached to headquarters.
But, of course, your judo and karate are special
skills requiring years of practice. How high did you get in
judo, Tiger?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger picked his teeth reminiscently. “No higher than a
Black Belt of the Seventh Dan. I never graduated to a Red
Belt, which is from the Eighth to the Eleventh Dan. To do
so would have meant abandoning all other forms of activity.
And with what object? To be promoted to the Twelfth
and final Dan on my death? In exchange for spending the
whole of my life tumbling about in the Kodokan Academy
in Tokyo? No thank you. That is the ambition of a
lunatic.” He smiled. “No <span class="it">saké</span>! No beautiful girls! Worse
still, probably no opportunity in a whole lifetime to exercise
my art in anger, to tackle a robber or murderer with
a gun and get the better of him. In the higher realms of
judo, you are nothing but a mixture between a monk and
a ballet dancer. Not for me!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Back on the open dusty road, some instinct made Bond
glance through the rear window between the dainty lace
blinds that are both the hall-mark of a truly sincere hired
car and a dangerous impediment to the driver’s vision. Far
behind, there was a solitary motor-cyclist. Later, when
they turned up a minor road into the mountains, he was
still there. Bond mentioned the fact. Tiger shrugged. “He
is perhaps a speed cop. If he is anyone else, he has chosen
a bad time and place.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The castle was the usual horned roof affair of Japanese
prints. It stood in a cleft between the mountains that must
have once been an important pass, for ancient cannon
pointed out from the summit of giant, slightly sloping
walls of black granite blocks. They were stopped at the
gate to a wooden causeway across a brimming moat and
again at the castle entrance. Tiger showed his pass, and
there was much hissing and deep bowing from the plainclothes
guards and a bell clanged in the topmost tier of
the soaring edifice, which, as Bond could see from the
inner courtyard, was badly in need of a coat of paint. As
the car came to a stop, young men in shorts and gym
shoes came running from various doors in the castle and
formed up behind three older men. They bowed almost
to the ground as Tiger descended regally from the car.
Tiger and Bond also bowed. Brief greetings were exchanged
with the older men, and Tiger then proceeded to fire off a
torrent of staccato Japanese which was punctuated by respectful
“<span class="it">Hai’s</span>” from the middle-aged man who was
obviously the commandant of the team. With a final “<span class="it">Hai</span>,
Tanaka-san,” this official turned to the twenty-odd students
whose ages seemed to be somewhere between twenty-five
and thirty-five. He called numbers, and six men fell
out of the ranks. They were given orders and ran off into
the castle. Tiger commented to Bond. “They will put on
camouflage clothes and go off into the mountains through
which we have come. If anyone is lurking about, they will
bring him to us. And now we will see a little demonstration
of an attack on the castle.” Tiger fired off some more
orders, the men dispersed at the double, and Bond followed
Tiger out on to the causeway accompanied by the chief
instructor, with whom Tiger had a long and animated discussion.
Perhaps a quarter of an hour later, there came a
whistle from above them on the ramparts and at once ten
men broke cover from the forest to their left. They were
dressed from head to foot in some black material, and only
their eyes showed through slits in the black hoods. They
ran down to the edge of the moat, donned oval battens of
what must have been some light wood such as balsa, and
skimmed across the water with a kind of skiing motion
until they reached the bottom of the giant black wall.
There they discarded their battens, took lengths of rope
and a handful of small iron pitons out of pockets in their
black robes, and proceeded to almost run up the walls
like fast black spiders.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger turned to Bond. “You understand that it is night-time.
In a few days, you will have to be doing something
similar. Note that the lengths of rope terminate in an iron
hook which they throw up and catch in crevices between
the stone blocks.” The instructor said something to Tiger
and pointed. Tiger nodded. He said to Bond, “The man at
the end is the weakest of the team. The instructor thinks
he will soon fall.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The line of climbing men was now almost at the summit
of the two-hundred-foot wall, and sure enough, with only
yards to go, the end man lost his foothold and, with arms
and legs flailing and with a scream of terror, fell back
down the sheer black face. His body hit once and then
crashed into the calm waters of the moat. The instructor
muttered something, stripped off his shirt, clambered on
to the rail of the causeway, and dived the hundred feet
down into the water. It was a perfect dive, and he swam
in a swift crawl towards the body that lay ominously face
downwards in the moat. Tiger turned to Bond. “It is of
no account. He was going to fail the man anyway. And
now come into the courtyard. The invaders have scaled
the wall and they will now use <span class="it">bojutsu</span> on the defenders—that
is fighting with the stave.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took a last glance at the instructor, who was now
towing the corpse, which it certainly was, to the shore by
its black hood. Bond wondered if any of the students was
going to fail his test at <span class="it">bojutsu</span>. Failure was certainly total
in Tiger’s training camp!</p>

<p class="pindent">Back in the courtyard, individual couples, dancing and
dodging, were fighting furious single combats with thick
staves about two yards long. They swung and parried with
two hands on the stave, lunged at the belly, using the stave
as a lance, or did complicated in-fighting with face almost
pressed against face. Bond was astonished to see tremendous
thrusts and whacks into the groin leaving the victim unmoved
when he, Bond, would have been writhing in agony.
He asked Tiger about this. Tiger, his eyes bright with the
lust of battle, answered briefly that he would explain this
later. Meanwhile, the invaders were slowly being overcome
by the defence. Black figures toppled unconscious or lay
groaning with hands clutched to head or stomach or shin.
Then there came a shrill blast on the whistle from one of
the instructors and it was all over. The defenders had won.
A doctor appeared and attended the fallen, and those who
were on their feet bowed deeply to one another and then
in the direction of Tiger. Tiger made a brief and fierce
speech which he later told Bond was of congratulation on
the sincerity of the display, and Bond was then led into
the castle to drink tea and view the museum of <span class="it">ninja</span>
armament. This included spiked steel wheels, the size of a
silver dollar, which could be whirled on the finger and
thrown, chains with spiked weights at each end, used like
the South American bolas for catching cattle, sharp nails
twisted into knots for defeating barefoot pursuers (Bond
remembered similar devices spread on the roads by the
Resistance to puncture the tyres of German staff cars),
hollowed bamboo for breathing under water (Bond had
used the same device during an adventure on a Caribbean
island), varieties of brass knuckles, gloves whose palms
were studded with very sharp, slightly hooked nails for
“walking” up walls and across ceilings, and a host of similar
rather primitive gadgets of offence and defence. Bond
made appropriate noises of approval and amazement and
reflected on the comparable Russian invention used with
much success in West Germany, a cyanide gas pistol that
left no trace and a sure diagnosis of heart failure. Tiger’s
much vaunted <span class="it">ninjutsu</span> just wasn’t in the same league!</p>

<p class="pindent">Out in the courtyard again, the leader of the camouflaged
troop reported the discovery of motor-cycle tyre
tracks that stopped and turned back a mile from the castle.
That had been the only trace of a tail. Then came, to
Bond, the blessed bows and farewells and they were on
their way again, bound for Kyoto.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, Bondo-san. What did you think of my training
school?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I thought it was very sincere. I can imagine that the
skills that are learned would be most valuable, but I would
have thought that the black dress for night work and the
various gadgets would have been as incriminating, if you
were caught, as a pistol. But they certainly went up that
wall damned quick, and that <span class="it">bojutsu</span> business would be
very effective against the usual night-prowler with a
bicycle chain or a flick-knife. I must get Swaine and
Adeney to make me a two-yard-long walking-stick.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger sucked his teeth impatiently. “You speak like a
man who only knows of the sort of fighting that goes on
in a cheap Western. You would not get very far with your
methods if you were trying to penetrate North Korea
dressed as a simple peasant with his staff.”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond was rather exhausted by the day. He was
also sorry for the student who had died showing off for
his and Tiger’s delectation. He said shortly, “None of your
<span class="it">ninja</span> would last very long in East Berlin,” and relapsed
into a surly silence.</p>
