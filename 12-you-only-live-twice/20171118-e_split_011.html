<p class="line8"><span class="sc">The huge right</span> fist crashed into the left palm with the
noise of a forty-five pistol shot. The great square face of
the Australian turned almost purple, and the veins stood
out on the grizzled temples. With controlled violence, but
almost under his breath, he intoned savagely:</p>


          <div class="poetry-container">
          <div class="lgp"> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class="lgl">
<p class="line7">“I bludge,</p>
<p class="line7">Thou bludgest,</p>
<p class="line7">He bludges,</p>
<p class="line7">We bludge,</p>
<p class="line7">You bludge,</p>
<p class="line7">They all bludge.”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class="line8">He reached under the low table, then seemed to think
better of it and moved his hand to the glass of <span class="it">saké</span>,
picked it up, and poured it down his throat without a
swallow.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said mildly, “Take it easy, Dikko. What’s bitten
you? And what does this vulgar-sounding colonial expression
mean?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Richard Lovelace Henderson, of Her Majesty’s Australian
Diplomatic Corps, looked belligerently round the small
crowded bar in a by-street off the Ginza and said out of
the corner of his large and usually cheerful mouth that
was now turned down in bitterness and anger, “You stupid
pommy bastard, we’ve been miked! That bludger Tanaka’s
miked us! Here, under the table! See the little wire
down the leg? And see that wingy over at the bar? Chap
with one arm looking bloody respectable in his blue suit
and black tie? That’s one of Tiger’s men. I can smell ’em
by now. They’ve been tailing me off and on for ten years.
Tiger dresses ’em all like little C.I.A. gentlemen. You
watch out for any Jap who’s drinking Western and wearing
that rig. All Tiger’s men.” He grumbled, “Damn good
mind to go over and call the bastard.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “Well, if we’re being miked, all this’ll make
sweet reading for Mr. Tanaka tomorrow morning.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What the hell,” said Dikko Henderson resignedly.
“The old bastard knows what I think of him. Now he’ll
just have it in writing. Teach him to stop leaning on me.
And my friends,” he added, with a blistering glance at
Bond. “It’s really you he wants to size up. And I don’t
mind if he hears me saying so. Bludger? Well, hear me
now, Tiger! This is the great Australian insult. You can
use it anyway.” He raised his voice. “But in general it
means a worthless pervert, ponce, scoundrel, liar, traitor,
and rogue—with no redeeming feature. And I hope your
stewed seaweed sticks in your gullet at breakfast tomorrow,
when you know what I think of you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. The torrent of powerful swear-words
had started its ceaseless flow the day before at the airport—Haneda,
“the field of wings.” It had taken Bond nearly
an hour to extract his single suit-case from the customs
area, and he had emerged fuming into the central hall only
to be jostled and pushed aside by an excited crowd of
young Japanese bearing paper banners that said “International
Laundry Convention.” Bond was exhausted from
his flight. He let out one single four-letter expletive.</p>

<p class="pindent">Behind him a big voice repeated the same word and
added some more. “That’s my boy! That’s the right way
to greet the East! You’ll be needing all those words and
more before you’re through with the area.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had turned. The huge man in the rumpled grey
suit thrust out a hand as big as a small ham. “Glad to
meet you. I’m Henderson. As you were the only pommy
on the plane, I guess you’re Bond. Here. Give me that
bag. Got a car outside, and the sooner we get away from
this blankety-blank madhouse, the better.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Henderson looked like a middle-aged prize-fighter who
has retired and taken to the bottle. His thin suit bulged
with muscle round the arms and shoulders and with fat
round the waist. He had a craggy, sympathetic face, rather
stony blue eyes, and a badly broken nose. He was sweating
freely (Bond was to find that he was always sweating),
and as he barged his way through the crowd, using
Bond’s suit-case as a battering ram, he extracted a rumpled
square of terry-cloth from his trouser-pocket and
wiped it round his neck and face. The crowd parted unresentfully
to let the giant through, and Bond followed
in his wake to a smart Toyopet saloon waiting in a no-parking
area. The chauffeur got out and bowed. Henderson
fired a torrent of instructions at him in fluent Japanese
and followed Bond into the back seat, settling himself
with a grunt. “Taking you to your hotel first—the
Okura, latest of the Western ones. American tourist got
murdered at the Royal Oriental the other day, and we
don’t want to lose you all that soon. Then we’ll do a bit
of serious drinking. Had some dinner?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“About six of them, as far as I can remember. J.A.L.
certainly takes good care of your stomach.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Why did you choose the willow-pattern route? How
was the old ruptured duck?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“They told me the bird was a crane. Very dainty. But
efficient. Thought I might as well practise being inscrutable
before plunging into all this.” Bond waved at the cluttered
shambles of the Tokyo suburbs through which they
were tearing at what seemed to Bond a suicidal speed.
“Doesn’t look the most attractive city in the world. And
why are we driving on the right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“God knows,” said Henderson moodily. “The bloody
Japs do everything the wrong way round. Read the old
instruction books wrong, I daresay. Light switches go up
instead of down. Taps turn to the left. Door handles likewise.
Why, they even race their horses clockwise instead
of anti-clockwise like civilized people. As for Tokyo, it’s
bloody awful. It’s either too hot or too cold or pouring
with rain. And there’s an earthquake about every day.
But don’t worry about them. They just make you feel
slightly drunk. The typhoons are worse. If one starts to
blow, go into the stoutest bar you can see and get drunk.
But the first ten years are the worst. It’s got its points
when you know your way around. Bloody expensive if
you live Western, but I stick to the back alleys and do
all right. Really quite exhilarating. Got to know the lingo,
though, and when to bow and take off your shoes and so
on. You’ll have to get the basic routines straight pretty
quickly if you’re going to make any headway with the
people you’ve come to see. Underneath the stiff collars and
striped pants in the government departments, there’s still
plenty of the old <span class="it">samurai</span> tucked away. I laugh at them
for it, and they laugh back because they’ve got to know
my line of patter. But that doesn’t mean I don’t bow from
the waist when I know it’s expected of me and when I
want something. You’ll get the hang of it all right.” Henderson
fired some Japanese at the driver, who had been
glancing frequently in his driving mirror. The driver
laughed and replied cheerfully. “Thought so,” said Henderson.
“We’ve got ourselves a tail. Typical of old Tiger.
I told him you were staying at the Okura, but he wants
to make sure for himself. Don’t worry. It’s just part of
his crafty ways. If you find one of his men breathing down
your neck in bed tonight, or a girl, if you’re lucky, just
talk to them politely and they’ll bow and hiss themselves
out.”</p>

<p class="pindent">But a solitary sleep had followed the serious drinking in
the Bamboo Bar of the Okura, and the next day had been
spent doing the sights and getting some cards printed that
described Bond as second secretary in the cultural department
of the Australian embassy. “They know that’s our
intelligence side,” said Henderson, “and they know I’m
the head of it and you’re my temporary assistant, so why
not spell it out for them?” And that evening they had
gone for more serious drinking to Henderson’s favourite
bar, Melody’s, off the Ginza, where everybody called Henderson
“Dikko” or “Dikko-san,” and where they were
ushered respectfully to the quiet corner table that appeared
to be his <span class="it">stammtisch</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">And now Henderson reached under the table and, with
a powerful wrench, pulled out the wires and left them
hanging. “I’ll give that black bastard Melody hell for this
when I get around to it,” he said belligerently. “And to
think of all I’ve done for the dingo bastard! Used to be
a favourite pub of the English colony and the press-club
layabouts. Had a good restaurant attached to it. That’s
gone now. The Eyteye cook trod on the cat and spilled
the soup, and he picked up the cat and threw it into the
cooking stove. Of course that got around pretty quick,
and all the animal-lovers and sanctimonious bastards got
together and tried to have Melody’s licence taken away. I
managed to put in squeeze in the right quarter and saved
him, but everyone quit his restaurant and he had to close
it. I’m the only regular who’s stuck to him. And now he
goes and does this to me! Oh well, he’ll have had the
squeeze put on <span class="it">him</span>, I suppose. Anyway, that’s the end
of the tape so far as T.T.’s concerned. I’ll give him hell,
too. He ought to have learned by now that me and my
friends don’t want to assassinate the Emperor or blow up
the Diet or something.” Dikko glared around him as if
he proposed to do both those things. “Now then, James,
to business. I’ve fixed up for you to meet Tiger tomorrow
morning at eleven. I’ll pick you up and take you there.
‘The Bureau of All-Asian Folkways.’ I won’t describe it
to you. It’d spoil it. Now, I don’t really know what you’re
here for. Spate of top-secret cables from Melbourne. To
be deciphered by yours truly in person. Thanks very much!
And my ambassador, Jim Saunderson, good bloke, says he
doesn’t want to know anything about it. Thinks it’d be
even better if he didn’t meet you at all. Okay with you?
No offence, but he’s a wise guy and likes to keep his hands
clean. And I don’t want to know anything about your
job either. That way, you’re the only one who gets the
powdered bamboo in his coffee. But I gather you want
to get some high-powered gen out of Tiger without the
C.I.A. knowing anything about it. Right? Well that’s going
to be a dicey business. Tiger’s a career man with a
career mind. Although, on the surface, he’s a hundred per
cent <span class="it">demokorasu</span>, he’s a deep one—very deep indeed. The
American occupation and the American influence here
look like a very solid basis for a total American-Japanese
alliance. But once a Jap, always a Jap. It’s the same with
all the other great nations—Chinese, Russian, German,
English. It’s their bones that matter, not their lying faces.
And all those races have got tremendous bones. Compared
with the bones, the smiles or scowls don’t mean a thing.
And time means nothing for them either. Ten years is the
blink of a star for the big ones. Get me? So Tiger, and
his superiors, who, I suppose, are the Diet and, in the end,
the Emperor, will look at your proposition principally
from two angles. Is it immediately desirable, today? Or
is it a long-term investment? Something that may pay off
for the country in ten, twenty years. And if I were you,
I’d stick to that spiel—the long-term talk. These people,
people like Tiger, who’s an absolutely top man in Japan,
don’t think in terms of days or months or years. They
think in terms of centuries. Quite right, when you come
to think of it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Dikko Henderson made a wide gesture with his left
hand. Bond decided that Dikko was getting cheerfully
tight. He had found a Palomar pony to run with. They
must be rare enough in Tokyo. They were both past the
eighth flask of <span class="it">saké</span>, but Dikko had also laid a foundation
of Suntory whisky in the Okura while he’d been waiting
for Bond to write out an innocuous cable to Melbourne
with the prefix “Informationwise,” which meant that it
was for Mary Goodnight, to announce his arrival and give
his current address. But it was all right with Bond that
Dikko should be getting plastered. He would talk better
and looser and, in the end, wiser that way. And Bond
wanted to pick his brains.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “But what sort of a chap is this Tanaka? Is
he your enemy or your friend?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Both. More of a friend probably. At least I’d guess so.
I amuse him. His C.I.A. pals don’t. He loosens up with
me. We’ve got things in common. We share a pleasure in
the delights of <span class="it">samsara</span>—wine and women. He’s a great
cocksman. I also have ambitions in that direction. I’ve
managed to keep him out of two marriages. Trouble with
Tiger is he always wants to marry ’em. He’s paying
cock-tax—that’s alimony, in the Australian vernacular—to
three already. So he’s acquired an ON with regard to
me. That’s an obligation—almost as important in the Japanese
way of life as ‘face.’ When you have an ON, you’re
not very happy until you’ve discharged it <span class="it">hon</span>ourably, if
you’ll pardon the bad pun. And if a man makes you a
present of a salmon, you mustn’t repay him with a shrimp.
It’s got to be with an equally large salmon—larger, if possible—so
that then you’ve jumped the man, and now he
has an ON with regard to you, and you’re quids in morally,
socially, and spiritually—and the last one’s the most
important. Well now. Tiger’s ON towards me is a very
powerful one, very difficult to discharge. He’s paid little
slices of it off with various intelligence dope. He’s paid
off another big slice by accepting your presence here and
giving you an interview so soon after your arrival. If
you’d been an ordinary supplicant, it might have taken
you weeks. He’d have given you a fat dose of <span class="it">shikirinaoshi</span>—that’s
making you wait, giving you the great
stone face. The <span class="it">sumo</span> wrestlers use it in the ring to make
an opponent look and feel small in front of the audience.
Got it? So you start with that in your favour. He would
be predisposed to do what you want because that would
remove all his ON towards me and, by his accounting,
stick a whole packet of ON on my back towards him.
But it’s not so simple as that. All Japanese have permanent
ON towards their superiors, the Emperor, their ancestors,
and the Japanese gods. This they can only discharge by
doing ‘the right thing.’ Not easy, you’ll say. Because how
can you know what the higher echelon thinks is the right
thing? Well, you get out of that by doing what the bottom
of the ladder thinks right—i.e., your immediate superiors.
That passes the buck, psychologically, on to the Emperor,
and he’s got to make his peace with ancestors and
gods. But that’s all right with him, because he embodies
all the echelons above him, so he can get on with dissecting
fish, which is his hobby, with a clear conscience. Got
it? It’s not really as mysterious as it sounds. Much the
same routine as operates in big corporations, like I.C.I. or
Shell, or in the services, except with them the ladder stops
at the board of directors or the chiefs of staff. It’s easier
that way. You don’t have to involve the Almighty and
your great-grandfather in a decision to cut the price of
aspirin by a penny a bottle.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It doesn’t sound very <span class="it">demokorasu</span> to me.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course it isn’t, you dumb bastard. For God’s sake,
get it into your head that the Japanese are a separate human
species. They’ve only been operating as a civilized
people, in the debased sense we talk about it in the West,
for fifty, at the most a hundred years. Scratch a Russian
and you’ll find a Tartar. Scratch a Japanese and you’ll find
a <span class="it">samurai</span>—or what he thinks is a <span class="it">samurai</span>. Most of this
<span class="it">samurai</span> stuff is a myth, like the Wild West bunk the
Americans are brought up on, or your knights in shining
armour at King Arthur’s court. Just because people play
baseball and wear bowler hats doesn’t mean they’re quote
civilized unquote. Just to show you I’m getting rather
tight—not drunk, mark you—I’d add that the U.N. are
going to reap the father and mother of a whirlwind by
quote liberating unquote the colonial peoples. Give ’em a
thousand years, yes. But give ’em ten, no. You’re only
taking away their blow-pipes and giving them machine-guns.
Just you wait for the first one to start crying to
high heaven for nuclear fission. Because they must have
quote parity unquote with the lousy colonial powers. I’ll
give you ten years for that to happen, my friend. And
when it does, I’ll dig myself a deep hole in the ground
and sit in it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. “That also doesn’t sound very <span class="it">demokorasu</span>.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“ ‘I fornicate upon thy <span class="it">demokorasu</span>’ as brother Hemingway
would have said. I stand for government by an
elite.” Dikko Henderson downed his ninth pint of <span class="it">saké</span>.
“And voting graded by each individual’s rating in that
elite. And one tenth of a vote for my government if you
don’t agree with me!”</p>

<p class="pindent">“For God’s sake, Dikko! How in hell did we get on to
politics? Let’s go and get some food. I’ll agree there’s a
certain aboriginal common sense in what you say . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’t talk to me about the aborigines! What in hell
do you think you know about the aborigines? Do you
know that in my country there’s a move afoot, not afoot,
at full gallop, to give the aborigines the vote? You pommy
poofter. You give me any more of that liberal crap and
I’ll have your balls for a bow tie.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said mildly, “What’s a poofter?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What you’d call a pansy. No,” Dikko Henderson got
to his feet and fired a string of what sounded like lucid
Japanese at the man behind the bar, “before I condemn
you utterly, we’ll go and eat eels—place where you can
get a serious bottle of plonk to match. Then we’ll go to
‘The House of Total Delight.’ After that, I will give you
my honest verdict, honestly come by.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “You’re a no-good kangaroo bum, Dikko.
But I like eels. As long as they’re not jellied. I’ll pay for
them and for the later relaxation. You pay for the rice
wine and the plonk, whatever that is. Take it easy. The
wingy at the bar has an appraising look.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I come to appraise Mr. Richard Lovelace Henderson,
not to bury him.” Dikko Henderson produced a wad of
thousand-yen notes and began counting them out for the
waiter. “Not yet, that is.” He walked, with careful majesty,
up to the bar and addressed himself to the large
Negro in a plum-coloured coat behind it. “Melody, be
ashamed of yourself!” Then he led the way, with massive
dignity, out of the bar.</p>
