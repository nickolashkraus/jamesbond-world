<h2 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_36"><span class="calibre1">One Golden Day</span></h2>

<p class="line8"><span class="sc">Dawn was a</span> beautiful haze of gold and blue. Bond went
outside and ate his bean curd and rice and drank his tea
sitting on the spotless doorstep of the little cut-stone and
timbered house, while indoors the family chattered like
happy sparrows as the women went about their housework.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had been allotted the room of honour, the small
sitting-room with its <span class="it">tatami</span> mats, scraps of furniture,
house shrine, and a cricket in a small cage “to keep you
company,” as Kissy had explained. Here his <span class="it">futon</span> had
been spread on the ground and he had for the first time
and with fair success tried sleeping with his head on the
traditional wooden pillow. The evening before, the father,
an emaciated greybeard with knotted joints and bright
squirrel eyes, had laughed with and at him as Kissy translated
Bond’s account of some of his adventures with Tiger,
and there was from the first a complete absence of tension
or self-consciousness. The priest had said that Bond should
be treated as a member of the family, and although his
appearance and some of his manners were strange, Kissy
had apparently announced her qualified approval of him,
and the parents followed her lead. At nine o’clock, under
the three-quarter moon, the father had beckoned to Bond
and had hobbled out with him to the back of the house.
He showed him the little shack with the hole in the ground
and the neatly quartered pages of the <span class="it">Asahi Shimbun</span> on a
nail, and the last of Bond’s private fears about life on the
island was removed. His flickering candle showed the place
to be as spotless as the house, and at least adequately salubrious.
After the soft movements in the other two rooms
had ceased, Bond had slept happily and like the dead.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kissy came out of the house. She was wearing a kind of
white cotton night-dress and a white cotton kerchief bound
up the thick black waves of her hair. She wore her equipment,
the weights and the heavy flat angular pick, over the
white dress; only her arms and feet were bare. Bond may
have shown his disappointment. She laughed, teasing him.
“This is ceremonial dress for diving in the presence of important
strangers. The <span class="it">kannushi-san</span> instructed me to wear
it in your company. As a mark of respect, of course.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Kissy, I believe that is a fib. The truth of the matter
is that you consider that your nakedness might arouse
dishonourable thoughts in my impious Western mind. That
is a most unworthy suspicion. However, I accept the
delicacy of your respect for my susceptibilities. And now,
let’s cut the cackle and get going. We’ll beat the <span class="it">awabi</span>
record today. What should we aim at?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Fifty would be good. A hundred would be wonderful.
But above all, you must row well and not let me drown.
And you must be kind to David.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Who’s David?” asked Bond, suddenly jealous at the
thought that he would not be having this girl to himself.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Wait and see.” She went back indoors and brought out
the balsa-wood tub and a great coil of fine quarter-inch
rope. She handed the rope to Bond and hoisted the tub on
her hip, leading the way along a small path away from the
village. The path descended slowly to a small cove in
which one rowing-boat, covered with dried reeds to protect
it from the sun, was drawn high up on the flat black
pebbles. Bond stripped off the reeds and laid them aside
and hauled the simple locally made craft down to the sea.
It was constructed of some heavy wood and lay low but
stable in the deeply shelving, totally transparent water.
He loaded in the rope and the wooden tub. Kissy had gone
to the other side of the little bay and had undone a string
from one of the rocks. She began winding it in slowly and
at the same time uttering a low cooing whistle. To Bond’s
astonishment, there was a flurry in the water of the bay
and a big black cormorant shot like a bullet through the
shallows and waddled up the beach to Kissy’s feet, craning
its neck up and down and hissing, apparently in anger.
But Kissy bent down and stroked the creature on its
plumed head and down the outstretched neck, at the same
time talking to it gaily. She came towards the boat, winding
up the long line, and the cormorant followed clumsily.
It paid no attention to Bond but jumped untidily over the
side of the boat and scrambled on to the small thwart in
the bows, where it squatted majestically and proceeded to
preen itself, running its long bill down and through its
breast feathers and occasionally opening its wings to the
full extent of their five-foot span and flapping them with
gentle grace. Then, with a final shimmy through all its
length, it settled down and gazed out to sea with its neck
coiled backwards as if to strike and its turquoise eyes questing
the horizon imperiously.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kissy climbed into the boat and settled herself with her
knees hunched decorously between Bond’s outstretched
legs, and Bond slid the heavy narrow-bladed oars into
their wooden rowlocks and began rowing at a powerful,
even pace, more or less, under Kissy’s direction, due north.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had noticed that Kissy’s line to the cormorant ended
with a thin brass ring, perhaps two inches in diameter,
round the base of the bird’s neck. This would be one of
the famous fishing cormorants of Japan. Bond asked her
about it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kissy said, “I found him as a baby three years ago. He
had oil on his wings, and I cleaned him and cared for him
and had him ringed. The ring has had to be made larger
as he grew up. Now, you see, he can swallow small fish,
but the big ones he brings to the surface in his beak. He
hands them over quite willingly and occasionally he gets
a piece of a big one as a reward. He swims a lot by my side
and keeps me company. It can be very lonely down there,
particularly when the sea is dark. You will have to hold
the end of the line and look after him when he comes to
the surface. Today he will be hungry. He has not been out
for three days because my father could not row the boat.
I have been going out with friends. So it is lucky for him
that you came to the island.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“So this is David?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes. I named him after the only man I liked in Hollywood—an
Englishman, as it happens. He was called David
Niven. He is a famous actor and producer. You have
heard of him?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course. I shall enjoy tossing him a scrap or two of
fish in exchange for the pleasure he has given me in his
other incarnation.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The sweat began to pour down Bond’s face and chest
into his bathing pants. Kissy undid the kerchief round her
hair and leant forward and mopped at him gently. Bond
smiled into her almond eyes and had his first close-up of
her snub nose and petalled mouth. She wore no make-up
and did not need to, for she had that rosy-tinted skin on
a golden background—the colours of a golden peach—that
is quite common in Japan. Her hair, released from the
kerchief, was black with dark-brown high-lights. It was
heavily waved, but with a soft fringe that ended an inch
or so above the straight fine eyebrows that showed no
signs of having been plucked. Her teeth were even and
showed no more prominently between the lips than with a
European girl, so that she avoided the toothiness that is
a weak point in the Japanese face. Her arms and legs were
longer and less masculine than is usual with Japanese girls,
and the day before, Bond had seen that her breasts and
buttocks were firm and proud and that her stomach was
almost flat—a beautiful figure, equal to that of any of
the star chorus girls he had seen in the cabarets of Tokyo.
But her hands and feet were rough and scarred with work,
and her finger-nails and toe-nails, although they were cut
very short, were broken. Bond found this rather endearing.
Ama means “sea-girl” or “sea-man,” and Kissy wore
the marks of competing with the creatures of the ocean
with obvious indifference, and her skin, which might have
suffered from constant contact with salt water, in fact
glowed with a golden sheen of health and vitality. But it
was the charm and directness of her eyes and smile as well
as her complete naturalness—for instance, when she
mopped at Bond’s face and chest—that endeared her so
utterly to Bond. At that moment, he thought there would
be nothing more wonderful than to spend the rest of his
life rowing her out towards the horizon during the day
and coming back with her to the small clean house in the
dusk.</p>

<p class="pindent">He shrugged the whimsy aside. Only another two days
to the full moon and he would have to get back to reality,
to the dark dirty life he had chosen for himself. He put
the prospect out of his mind. Today and the next day
would be stolen days, days with only Kissy and the boat
and the bird and the sea. He must just see to it that they
were happy days and lucky ones for her and her harvest
of sea-shells.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kissy said, “Not much longer. And you have rowed
well.” She gestured to the right, to where the rest of the
Ama fleet was spread out over the ocean. “With us, it is
first come first served with the sites we choose. Today we
can get out as far as a shoal most of us know of, and we
shall have it to ourselves. There the seaweed is thick on the
rocks, and that is what the <span class="it">awabi</span> feed on. It is deep, about
forty feet, but I can stay down for almost a minute, long
enough to pick up two, three <span class="it">awabi</span> if I can find them.
That is just a matter of luck in feeling about with the
hands among the seaweed, for you rarely see the shells.
You only feel them and dislodge them with this,” she
tapped her angular pick. “After a while I shall have to
rest. Then perhaps you would like to go down. Yes? They
tell me you are a good swimmer, and I have brought a
pair of my father’s goggles. These bulbs at the sides,” she
showed him, “have to be squeezed to equalize the pressure
between the glasses and the eyes. You will perhaps not be
able to stay down long to begin with. But you will learn
quickly. How long will you be staying on Kuro?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Only two or three days, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, but that is sad. What will David and I do for a
boatman then?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Perhaps your father will get better.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That is so. I must take him to a cure place at one of the
volcanoes on the mainland. Otherwise it will mean marrying
one of the men on Kuro. That is not easy. The choice
is not wide, and because I have a little money from my
film work—and a little is a lot, on Kuro—the man might
want to marry me for the wrong reasons. That would be
sad, and how is one to know?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Perhaps you will go back into films?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Her expression became fierce. “Never. I hated it. They
were all disgusting to me in Hollywood. They thought
that because I am a Japanese I am some sort of an animal
and that my body is for everyone. Nobody treated me
honourably except this Niven.” She shook her head to get
rid of the memories. “No. I will stay on Kuro for ever.
The gods will solve my problems,” she smiled, “as they
have today.” She scanned the sea ahead. “Another hundred
yards.” She got up and, balancing perfectly despite the
swell, tied the end of the long rope round her waist and
adjusted the goggles above her forehead. “Now remember,
keep the rope taut, and when you feel one tug, pull me
up quickly. It will be hard work for you, but I will
massage your back when we get home this evening. I am
very good at it. I have had enough practice with my father.
Now!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shipped the oars gratefully. Behind him, David
began shifting on his feet, craning his long neck and hissing
impatiently. Kissy tied a short line to the wooden tub and
put it over the side. She followed, slipping decorously into
the water and clasping her white dress between her knees
so that it did not flower out around her. At once, David
dived and disappeared without a ripple. The line, tied to
Bond’s thwart, began paying out fast. He picked up the
coil of Kissy’s rope and stood up, his joints cracking. Kissy
pulled down her goggles and put her head underwater. In
a moment, she came up. She smiled. “Yes, it looks fine
down there.” She rested in the water and began making a
soft cooing whistle through pursed lips—to fill her lungs
to the uttermost, Bond assumed. Then, with a brief wave
of the hand, she put down her head and arched her hips
so that Bond had a brief sight of the black string cleaving
her behind under the thin material. Suddenly, like a fleeting
white wraith, she was gone, straight down, her feet
twinkling behind her in a fast crawl to help the pull of the
weights.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond paid out fast, keeping an anxious eye on his watch.
David appeared below him, bearing a half-pound silvery
fish crosswise in his beak. Damn the bird! This was no time
to get mixed up with retrieving fish from the extremely
sharp-looking beak. But with a contemptuous glance, the
cormorant tossed the fish into the floating tub and disappeared
like a black bullet.</p>

<p class="pindent">Fifty seconds! Bond started nervously when the tug
came. He pulled in fast. The white wraith appeared far
below in the crystal water, and as she came up, Bond saw
that her hands were tight against her sides to streamline
her body. She broke surface beside the boat and held out
two fat <span class="it">awabi</span> to show him and then dropped them into
the tub. She held on to the side of the boat to regain her
breath, and Bond gazed down at the wonderful breasts, taut
beneath their thin covering. She smiled briefly up at him,
began her cooing whistle, and then came the exciting arch
of the back, and she was gone again.</p>

<p class="pindent">An hour went by. Bond got used to the routine and had
time to watch the nearest of the fleet of other boats. They
covered perhaps a mile of sea, and from across the silent
water, there came the recurrent eerie whistle—a soft, sea-bird
sound—of the diving girls. The nearest boat rocked
in the slow swell perhaps a hundred yards away, and
Bond watched the young man at the rope and caught an
occasional glimpse of a beautiful golden body, shiny as a
seal, and heard the excited chattering of their voices. He
hoped he would not disgrace himself when it came to his
turn to dive. <span class="it">Saké</span> and cigarettes! Not a good mixture to
train on!</p>

<p class="pindent">The pile of <span class="it">awabi</span> was slowly growing in the tub and,
amongst them, perhaps a dozen leaping fish. Occasionally,
Bond bent down and retrieved one from David. Once he
dropped a slippery fish, and the bird had to dive for it
again. This time he received an even haughtier look of scorn
from the turquoise eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then Kissy came up, her stint done, and climbed, not
so decorously this time, into the boat, and tore off her
kerchief and goggles and sat panting quietly in the stern.
Finally she looked up and laughed happily. “That is
twenty-one. Very good. Now take my weights and pick
and see for yourself what it is like down there. But I will
pull you up anyway in thirty seconds. Give me your watch.
And please do not lose my <span class="it">tegane</span>, my pick, or our day’s
fishing will be over.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s first dive was a clumsy affair. He went down too
slowly and barely had time to survey the grassy plain,
scattered with black rocks and clumps of <span class="it">Posidonia</span>, the
common seaweed of all the oceans, when he felt himself
being hauled up. He had to admit to himself that his lungs
were in terrible shape, but he had spied one promising
rock thick with weed, and on his next dive he got straight
to it and clung, searching among the roots with his right
hand. He felt the smooth oval of a shell, but before he
could get the pick to it, he was being pulled up again. But
he got the shell on this third try, and Kissy laughed with
pleasure as he dropped it into the tub. He managed to keep
the diving up for about half an hour, but then his lungs
began to ache and his body to feel the cold of the October
sea and he came up for the last time simultaneously with
David, who shot past him like a beautiful gleaming black
fish with green high-lights and, as a mark of approval,
pecked gently at his hair as Bond deposited his fifth shell
in the tub.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kissy was pleased with him. She had a rough brown
kimono in the boat and she rubbed him down with it as
he sat with bowed head and heaving chest. Then, while he
rested, she hauled the wooden tub inboard and emptied its
contents into the bottom of the boat. She produced a knife
and cut one of the fish down the middle and fed the two
halves to David, who was riding expectantly beside the
boat. He swallowed the pieces in two great gulps and set
to preening his feathers contentedly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Later they stopped for a lunch of rice with a few small
bits of fish in it and dried seaweed which tasted of salty
spinach. And then, after a short rest in the bottom of the
boat, the work went on until four o’clock, when a small
chill breeze came from nowhere and got between them and
the warmth of the sun and it was time to make the long
row home. Kissy climbed for the last time into the boat
and gave several soft tugs at David’s line. He surfaced
some distance from the boat, and as if this was a well-worn
routine, rose into the air and circled round them again and
again before making a low dive and skiing in to the side
of the boat on his webbed feet. He flapped his way over the
side and went to his perch, where he stood with wings
magnificently outstretched to dry and waited in this lordly
stance for his boatman to take him back home to his cove.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kissy changed with extreme propriety into her brown
kimono and dried herself inside it. She announced that
their haul was sixty-five <span class="it">awabi</span>, which was quite wonderful.
Of these Bond was responsible for ten, which was a
very honourable first catch. Ridiculously pleased with himself,
Bond took a vague bearing on the island which, because
of the drifting of the boat, was now only a speck
on the horizon, and gradually worked himself into the slow
unlaboured sweep of a Scottish gillie.</p>

<p class="pindent">His hands were sore, his back ached as if he had been
thrashed with a wooden truncheon, and his shoulders were
beginning to sting with sunburn, but he comforted himself
with the reflection that he was only doing what he
would have had to do anyway—get into training for the
swim and the climb and what would come afterwards, and
he rewarded himself from time to time with a smile into
Kissy’s eyes. They never left him, and the low sun shone
into them and turned the soft brown to gold. And the
speck became a lump, and the lump an island, and at last
they were home.</p>
