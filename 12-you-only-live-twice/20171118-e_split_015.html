<h2 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_30"><span class="calibre1">Slay It with Flowers</span></h2>

<p class="line8"><span class="sc">It was three o’clock</span>, in the morning. The noise of the
traffic to Yokohama had died. James Bond didn’t feel tired.
He was now totally absorbed in this extraordinary story
of the Swiss doctor, who, as Tiger had originally said, “collected
death.” Tiger wasn’t telling him this bizarre case
history for his entertainment. There was going to come a
moment of climax. What would that climax be?</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger wiped his hand over his face. He said, “Did you
read a story in the <span class="it">Japan Times</span> today? It concerned a suicide.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“This was a young student aged eighteen who had failed
his examination for the university for the second time. He
lived in the suburbs of Tokyo. There was construction
work on a new <span class="it">departmento</span>, a department store, going on
near where he lived. He went out of his room on to the
site. A pile-driver was at work, sinking the foundations.
Suddenly this youth broke through the surrounding workmen
and, as the pile came crashing down, laid his head
on the block beneath it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What a ghastly business! Why?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“He had brought dishonour on his parents, his ancestors.
This was his way of expiation. Suicide is a most unfortunate
aspect of the Japanese way of life.” Tiger paused. “Or
perhaps a most noble one. It depends how you look at it.
That boy, and his family, will have gained great face in
his neighbourhood.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You can’t gain face from strawberry jam.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Think again, Bondo-san. Your posthumous V.C.s, for
instance?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“They’re not awarded for committing suicide after failing
in an examination.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“We are not so <span class="it">demokorasu</span> as you are.” There was irony
in Tiger’s voice. “Dishonour must be expunged—according
to those of us who remain what you would describe
as old-fashioned. There is no apology more sincere than
the offering up of your own life. It is literally all you have
to give.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“But even if this boy failed for the university, he could
have gone for a lower standard of examination, for a lower
grade of college. As you know, we say ‘Blast!’ or perhaps
a stronger word if we fail an examination in Britain. But
we readjust our sights, or our parents do it for us, and
have another bash. We don’t kill ourselves. It wouldn’t
occur to us. It would be dishonourable rather than honourable.
It would be cowardly—a refusal to stand up to
reverses, to life. And it would give great pain to our parents,
and certainly no satisfaction to our ancestors.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“With us it is different. And despite <span class="it">demokorasu</span>, the
parents of this youth will be rejoicing this evening and
their neighbours will be rejoicing with them. Honour is
more important to us than life—more proud, more beautiful.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shrugged. “Well, I just think that if the boy had
the guts to do this thing, it was the waste of a perfectly
good Japanese life. In fact, of course, this suicide business
in Japan is nothing more than a form of hysteria—an expression
of the streak of violence that seems to run all
through the history of Japan. If you hold your own life
so cheaply, it follows that you will hold others’ lives even
more cheaply. The other day, I saw a traffic accident at
one of the main crossings. I don’t know the name of it.
It was a multiple affair, and there were bodies all over the
place. The police came, but instead of concentrating on
getting the wounded to hospital, insisted that they should
lie where they were so that they could draw chalk lines
round them and photograph them—presumably for use
when the case came to court.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That is common practice,” said Tiger indifferently.
“We are much overpopulated. Abortion is legal. It is helping
to solve one of our problems if a few extra people die
in an automobile accident. But there is something in what
you said earlier. Our word for suicide is <span class="it">jisatsu</span>, literally
‘self-murder,’ and although it is a violent solution to a personal
problem, it carries no stigma as it would in your
country. In fact, one of our most famous folk-tales,
known to all children, is of the forty-seven <span class="it">ronin</span>, or bodyguards.
Through their negligence, their lord, Asano, was
assassinated. They swore to avenge him, and they did so.
But then they came together at a place called Ako and
all committed <span class="it">seppuku</span> to expiate their negligence. This is
what you know as <span class="it">hara-kiri</span>, which is a vulgar term meaning
‘belly-cutting.’ Today, at the time of the festival at
the Ako shrine, special trains have to be laid on to accommodate
the respectful pilgrims.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, if you bring your children up on that sort of
stuff, you can’t expect them not to venerate the act of
suicide.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Just so,” said Tiger proudly. “Twenty-five thousand
Japanese commit suicide every year. Only the bureaucrats
regard that as a shameful statistic. And the more spectacular
the suicide, the more warmly it is approved. Not
long ago, a young student achieved great renown by trying
to saw his own head off. Lovers link hands and throw
themselves over the very high Kegon Falls at Nikko. The
Mihara volcano on the island of Oshima is another favourite
locale. People run down the roasting slope of the
crater and hurl themselves, their shoes on fire, into the
bubbling cauldron in its centre. To combat this popular
pastime, the interfering authorities have now opened, at
great expense, a ‘Suicide Prevention Office’ on the peak.
But always the wheels of the good old-fashioned railway
train provide the most convenient guillotine. They have
the merit of being self-operating. All you need to do is
make a four-foot jump.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You’re a bloodthirsty old bastard, Tiger. But what’s
all this lecture about anyway? What’s it got to do with
friend Shatterhand and his pretty garden?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Everything, Bondo-san. Everything. You see, much
against the good doctor’s wishes, of course, his poison garden
has become the most desirable site for suicides in the
whole of Japan. It has everything—a ride on our famous
‘Romance’ express to Kyoto; a boat trip across our beautiful
Inland Sea that is so full of Japanese history; a local
train from the terminal harbour at Beppu to Fukuoka, and
a walk or taxi drive along a beautiful coast to the awe-inspiring
ramparts of this mysterious Castle of Death.
Climb these, or smuggle yourself in on a provision cart,
and then a last delicious ruminative walk, perhaps hand-in-hand
with your lover, through the beautiful groves.
And finally the great gamble, the game of <span class="it">pachinko</span> the
Japanese love so much. Which ball will have your number
on it? Will your death be easy or painful? Will a
Russell’s Viper strike at your legs as you walk the silent
well-raked paths? Will some kindly, deadly dew fall upon
you during the night as you rest under this or that gorgeous
tree? Or will hunger or curiosity lead you to munch
a handful of those red berries or pick one of those orange
fruits? Of course, if you want to make it quick, there is
always a bubbling, sulphurous fumarole at hand. In any
one of those, the thousand degrees Centigrade will allow
you just enough time for one scream. The place is nothing
more than a <span class="it">departmento</span> of death, its shelves laden
with delicious packages of self-destruction, all given away
for nothing. Can you not imagine that old and young
flock there as if to a shrine? The police have erected a
barricade across the road. Genuine visitors, botanists and
so on, have to show a pass. But the suicides fight their way
to the shrine across the fields and marshes, scrabble at the
great walls, break their nails to gain entrance. The good
doctor is, of course, much dismayed. He has erected stern
notices of warning, with skulls and crossbones upon them.
They act only as advertisements! He has even gone to the
expense of flying one of those high helium balloons from
the roof of his castle. The hanging streamers threaten trespassers
with prosecution. But, alas for the doctor’s precautions,
the high balloon serves only to beckon. ‘Here is
death!’ it proclaims. ‘Come and get it!’ ”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You’re daft, Tiger. Why don’t you arrest him? Burn
the place down?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Arrest him for what? For presenting Japan with this
unique collection of rare plants? Burn down a million-pound
establishment belonging to a respected <span class="it">gaijin</span> resident?
The man has done nothing wrong. If anyone is to
blame, it is the Japanese people. It is true that he could
exercise more careful surveillance, have his grounds more
regularly patrolled. And it is certainly odd that when he
has the ambulance called, the victims are always totally
dead and are usually in the form of a bag of calcined bones
fished out of one of the fumaroles. From the list I have
shown you, one would have expected some to be only
crippled, or blinded. The Herr Doktor expresses himself
as much puzzled. He suggests that, in the cases of blindness
or amnesia, the victims presumably fall into one of
the fumaroles by mistake. Maybe. But as I have said, his
tally so far is over five hundred, and with the stream of
publicity, more and more people will be attracted to the
Castle of Death. We have got to put a stop to it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What steps have been taken so far?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Commissions of investigation have visited the doctor.
They have been most courteously treated. The doctor has
begged that something shall be done to protect him from
these trespassers. He complains that they interfere with
his work, break off precious boughs, and pick valuable
plants. He shows himself as entirely co-operative with any
measures that can be suggested short of abandoning this
project, which is so dear to his heart and so much appreciated
by the Japanese specialists in botany and so forth.
He has made a further most generous offer. He is constructing
a research department—to be manned by workers
of his own choice, mark you—to extract the poisons
from his shrubs and plants and give the essences free to
an appropriate medical research centre. You will have
noted that many of these poisons are valuable medicines
in a diluted form.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“But how has all this come on your plate?” Bond was
now getting drowsy. It was four o’clock, and the horizon
of jagged grey porcelain-shingled roof-tops was lightening.
He poured down the last of the <span class="it">saké</span>. It had the flat
taste of too much. It was time he was in bed. But Tiger
was obviously obsessed with this lunatic business, and subtle
authentic glimpses of Japan were coming through the
ridiculous nightmare story with its undertones of Poe, Le
Fanu, Bram Stoker, Ambrose Bierce.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger seemed unaffected by the lateness of the hour. The
<span class="it">samurai</span> face was perhaps etched in more sinister, more
brutal lines. The hint of Tartar, tamed and civilized,
lurked with less concealment, like a caged animal, in the
dark pools of his eyes. But the occasional rocking motion
on the buttocks and sides of the feet was the only sign
that he was interested, even excited. He said, “One month
ago, Bondo-san, I sent one of my best men into this place
to try and discover what it was all about. I was so instructed
by my Minister, the Minister of the Interior. He
in turn was under orders from the Prime Minister. The
matter was becoming one of public debate. I chose a good
man. He was instructed to get into the place, observe, and
report. One week later, Bondo-san, he was recovered from
the sea on a beach near this Castle of Death. He was
blinded and in delirium. The lower half of his body was
terribly burned. He could only babble a <span class="it">haiku</span> about dragonflies.
I later discovered that, as a youth, he had indulged
in the pastime of our youngsters. He had tied a female
dragonfly on a thread and let it go. This acts as a lure for
the male dragonfly, and you can quickly catch many males
in this way. They attach themselves to the female and will
not let go. The <span class="it">haiku</span>—that is a verse of seventeen syllables—he
kept on reciting until his death, which came
soon, was ‘Desolation! Pink dragonflies flitting above the
perfumed graves.’ ”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond felt he was living inside a dream: the little
room, partitioned in imitation rice-paper and cedar plywood,
the open vista of a small inscrutable garden in which
water tinkled, the distant redness of an imminent dawn,
the long background of <span class="it">saké</span> and cigarettes, the quiet voice
of the story-teller telling a fairy-tale, as it might be told
in a tent under the stars. And yet this was something that
had happened the other day, close by—was happening
now, something that Tiger had brought him here to tell.
Why? Because he was lonely? Because there was no one
else he could trust? Bond pulled himself out of his somnolent
slouch. He said, “I’m sorry, Tiger. What did you
do next?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger Tanaka seemed to sit slightly more upright on his
black-edged rectangle of golden <span class="it">tatami</span>. He looked very
directly at James Bond and said, “What was there to do?
I did nothing except apologize to my superiors. I waited
for an honourable solution to present itself. I waited for
you to come.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Me!”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You were sent. It might have been another.”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond yawned. He couldn’t help it. He could see
no end to the evening. Tiger had got some Japanese bee
in his Japanese bonnet. How in hell could Bond stop it
buzzing? He said, “Tiger. It’s time for bed. Let’s talk
about the rest of this tomorrow. Of course I’ll give you
any advice I can. I can see it’s a difficult problem. But
those are just the ones to sleep on.” He made to rise from
his chair.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger said, and it was an order, “Sit down, Bondo-san.
If you have any regard for your country, you leave tomorrow.”
He consulted his watch. “By the twelve-twenty
from Tokyo main station. Your ultimate destination is
Fukuoka on the southern island of Kyushu. You will not
be going back to your hotel. You will not be seeing Dikko.
From now on you are under my personal orders.” The
voice went very quiet and velvety. “Is that understood?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat up as if he had been stung. “What in God’s
name are you talking about, Tiger?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger Tanaka said, “In my office the other day you
made a significant statement. You said words to the effect
that in exchange for <span class="sc">magic</span> 44 you were empowered
to carry out any personal services that I might require of
you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I didn’t say that I was empowered. I meant that I
would do anything for you on my personal responsibility.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That is quite good enough. I took you at your word
and I requested an audience of the Prime Minister. He instructed
me to proceed, but to regard the matter as a state
secret known only to him and to me—and of course to
you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Come on, Tiger,” said Bond impatiently. “Cut the
cackle. What is it you want me to do?”</p>

<p class="pindent">But Tiger was not to be hurried. He said, “Bondo-san,
I will now be blunt with you, and you will not be offended,
because we are friends. Yes? Now it is a sad fact
that I, and many of us in positions of authority in Japan,
have formed an unsatisfactory opinion about the British
people since the war. You have not only lost a great empire,
you have seemed almost anxious to throw it away
with both hands. All right,” he held up a hand, “we will
not go deeply into the reasons for this policy, but when
you apparently sought to arrest this slide into impotence
at Suez, you succeeded only in stage-managing one of the
most pitiful bungles in the history of the world, if not
the worst. Further, your governments have shown themselves
successively incapable of ruling and have handed
over effective control of the country to the trades-unions,
which appear to be dedicated to the principle of doing less
and less work for more money. This feather-bedding, this
shirking of an honest day’s work, is sapping at ever-increasing
speed the moral fibre of the British, a quality the
world once so much admired. In its place we now see a
vacuous aimless horde of seekers-after-pleasure—gambling
at the pools and bingo, whining at the weather and the
declining fortunes of the country, and wallowing nostalgically
in gossip about the doings of the Royal Family and
of your so-called aristocracy in the pages of the most debased
newspapers in the world.”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond roared with laughter. “You’ve got a bloody
cheek, Tiger! You ought to write that out, sign it ‘Octogenarian,’
and send it in to <span class="it">The Times</span>. You just come
over and take a look at the place. It’s not doing all that
badly.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Bondo-san, you have pleaded guilty out of your own
mouth. ‘Not doing too badly,’ indeed! That is the crybaby
excuse of a boy who gets a thoroughly bad end-of-term
report. In fact, you are doing very badly indeed in
the opinion of your few remaining friends. And now you
come to me and ask for some very important intelligence
material to bolster up the pitiful ruins of a once great
power. Why should we give it to you? What good will it
do us? What good will it do you, Bondo-san? It is like
giving smelling salts to a punch-drunk heavy-weight just
before the inevitable knock-out.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said angrily, “Balls to you, Tiger! And balls again!
Just because you’re a pack of militant potential murderers
here, longing to get rid of your American masters and
play at being <span class="it">samurai</span> again, snarling behind your subservient
smiles, you only judge people by your own jungle
standards. Let me tell you this, my fine friend. England
may have been bled pretty thin by a couple of world wars,
our welfare-state politics may have made us expect too
much for free, and the liberation of our colonies may have
gone too fast, but we still climb Everest and beat plenty
of the world at plenty of sports and win Nobel Prizes.
Our politicians may be a feather-pated bunch, but I expect
yours are, too. All politicians are. But there’s nothing
wrong with the British people—although there are
only fifty million of them.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger Tanaka smiled happily. “Well spoken, Bondo-san.
I thought your famous English stoicism might break down
if I hit hard enough. I just wanted to see. And, for your
information, those are very similar to the words I addressed
to my Prime Minister. And do you know what
he said? He said, all right, Mr. Tanaka. Put this Commander
Bond to the test. If he succeeds, I will agree that
there is still an elite in Britain and that this valuable material
would be safe in their hands. If he fails, you will
politely turn down the request.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shrugged impatiently. He was still smarting under
Tiger’s onslaught, and the half-truths which he knew
lay behind his words. “All right, Tiger. What is this ridiculous
test? Some typical bit of <span class="it">samurai</span> nonsense, I suppose.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“More or less,” agreed Tiger Tanaka, with equanimity.
“You are to enter this Castle of Death and slay the dragon
within.”</p>
