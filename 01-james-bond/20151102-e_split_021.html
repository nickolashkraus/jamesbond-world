<p class="pindent">You are about to awake when you dream that you are
dreaming.</p>

<p class="pindent">During the next two days James Bond was permanently
in this state without regaining consciousness. He watched
the procession of his dreams go by without any effort to disturb
their sequence, although many of them were terrifying
and all were painful. He knew that he was in a bed and that
he was lying on his back and could not move and in one of
his twilight moments he thought there were people round
him, but he made no effort to open his eyes and re-enter
the world.</p>

<p class="pindent">He felt safer in the darkness and he hugged it to him.</p>

<p class="pindent">On the morning of the third day a bloody nightmare
shook him awake, trembling and sweating. There was a
hand on his forehead which he associated with his dream.
He tried to lift an arm and smash it sideways into the owner
of the hand, but his arms were immovable, secured to the
sides of his bed. His whole body was strapped down and
something like a large white coffin covered him from chest
to feet and obscured his view of the end of the bed. He
shouted a string of obscenities, but the effort took all his
strength and the words tailed off into a sob. Tears of forlornness
and self-pity welled out of his eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">A woman’s voice was speaking and the words gradually
penetrated to him. It seemed to be a kind voice and it
slowly came to him that he was being comforted and that
this was a friend and not an enemy. He could hardly believe
it. He had been so certain that he was still a captive and
that the torture was about to begin again. He felt his face
being softly wiped with a cool cloth which smelt of lavender
and then he sank back into his dreams.</p>

<p class="pindent">When he awoke again some hours later all his terrors had
gone and he felt warm and languorous. Sun was streaming
into the bright room and garden sounds came through the
window. In the background there was the noise of small
waves on a beach. As he moved his head he heard a rustle,
and a nurse who had been sitting beside his pillow rose and
came into his line of vision. She was pretty and she smiled
as she put her hand on his pulse.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, I’m certainly glad you’ve woken up at last. I’ve
never heard such dreadful language in my life.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled back at her.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Where am I?’ he asked and was surprised that his voice
sounded firm and clear.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’re in a nursing home at Royale and I’ve been sent
over from England to look after you. There are two of us
and I’m Nurse Gibson. Now just lie quiet and I’ll go and
tell the doctor you’re awake. You’ve been unconscious
since they brought you in and we’ve been quite worried.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond closed his eyes and mentally explored his body.
The worst pain was in his wrists and ankles and in his right
hand where the Russian had cut him. In the centre of the
body there was no feeling. He assumed that he had been
given a local anaesthetic. The rest of his body ached dully
as if he had been beaten all over. He could feel the pressure
of bandages everywhere and his unshaven neck and chin
prickled against the sheets. From the feel of the bristles
he knew that he must have been at least three days without
shaving. That meant two days since the morning of the
torture.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was preparing a short list of questions in his mind
when the door opened and the doctor came in followed by
the nurse and in the background the dear figure of Mathis,
a Mathis looking anxious behind his broad smile, who put
a finger to his lips and walked on tiptoe to the window and
sat down.</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor, a Frenchman with a young and intelligent
face, had been detached from his duties with the Deuxième
Bureau to look after Bond’s case. He came and stood beside
Bond and put his hand on Bond’s forehead while he looked
at the temperature chart behind the bed.</p>

<p class="pindent">When he spoke he was forthright.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You have a lot of questions to ask, my dear Mr Bond,’
he said in excellent English, ‘and I can tell you most of the
answers. I do not want you to waste your strength, so I
will give you the salient facts and then you may have a few
minutes with Monsieur Mathis who wishes to obtain one or
two details from you. It is really too early for this talk,
but I wish to set your mind at rest so that we can proceed
with the task of repairing your body without bothering too
much about your mind.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Nurse Gibson pulled up a chair for the doctor and left
the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You have been here about two days,’ continued the
doctor. ‘Your car was found by a farmer on the way to
market in Royale and he informed the police. After some
delay Monsieur Mathis heard that it was your car and he
immediately went to Les Noctambules with his men. You
and Le Chiffre were found and also your friend, Miss Lynd,
who was unharmed and according to her account suffered
no molestation. She was prostrated with shock, but is now
fully recovered and is at her hotel. She has been instructed
by her superiors in London to stay at Royale under your
orders until you are sufficiently recovered to go back to
England.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Le Chiffre’s two gunmen are dead, each killed by a
single ·35 bullet in the back of the skull. From the lack of
expression on their faces, they evidently never saw or heard
their assailant. They were found in the same room as Miss
Lynd. Le Chiffre is dead, shot with a similar weapon between
the eyes. Did you witness his death?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Your own injuries are serious, but your life is not in
danger though you have lost a lot of blood. If all goes well,
you will recover completely and none of the functions of
your body will be impaired.’ The doctor smiled grimly.
‘But I fear that you will continue to be in pain for several
days and it will be my endeavour to give you as much
comfort as possible. Now that you have regained consciousness
your arms will be freed, but you must not move
your body and when you sleep the nurse has orders to
secure your arms again. Above all, it is important that you
rest and regain your strength. At the moment you are suffering
from a grave condition of mental and physical
shock.’ The doctor paused. ‘For how long were you maltreated?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘About an hour,’ said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Then it is remarkable that you are alive and I congratulate
you. Few men could have supported what you have
been through. Perhaps that is some consolation. As Monsieur
Mathis can tell you, I have had in my time to treat
a number of patients who have suffered similar handling
and not one has come through it as you have done.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor looked at Bond for a moment and then
turned brusquely to Mathis.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You may have ten minutes and then you will be forcibly
ejected. If you put the patient’s temperature up, you will
answer for it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He gave them both a broad smile and left the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis came over and took the doctor’s chair.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s a good man,’ said Bond. ‘I like him.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He’s attached to the Bureau,’ said Mathis. ‘He is a
very good man and I will tell you about him one of these
days. He thinks you are a prodigy—and so do I.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘However, that can wait. As you can imagine, there
is much to clear up and I am being pestered by Paris and,
of course, London, and even by Washington via our good
friend Leiter. Incidentally,’ he broke off, ‘I have a personal
message from M. He spoke to me himself on the telephone.
He simply said to tell you that he is much impressed. I
asked if that was all and he said: “Well, tell him that the
Treasury is greatly relieved.” Then he rang off.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond grinned with pleasure. What most warmed him
was that M himself should have rung up Mathis. This was
quite unheard of. The very existence of M, let alone his
identity, was never admitted. He could imagine the flutter
this must have caused in the ultra-security-minded organization
in London.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A tall thin man with one arm came over from London
the same day we found you,’ continued Mathis, knowing
from his own experience that these shop details would
interest Bond more than anything else and give him most
pleasure, ‘and he fixed up the nurses and looked after
everything. Even your car’s being repaired for you. He
seemed to be Vesper’s boss. He spent a lot of time with her
and gave her strict instructions to look after you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Head of S, thought Bond. They’re certainly giving me
the red carpet treatment.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now,’ said Mathis, ‘to business. Who killed Le Chiffre?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="sc">Smersh</span>,’ said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis gave a low whistle.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My God,’ he said respectfully. ‘So they <span class="it">were</span> on to
him. What did he look like?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond explained briefly what had happened up to the
moment of Le Chiffre’s death, omitting all but the most
essential details. It cost him an effort and he was glad when
it was done. Casting his mind back to the scene awoke the
whole nightmare and the sweat began to pour off his forehead
and a deep throb of pain started up in his body.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis realized that he was going too far. Bond’s voice
was getting feebler and his eyes were clouding. Mathis
snapped shut his shorthand book and laid a hand on Bond’s
shoulder.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Forgive me, my friend,’ he said. ‘It is all over now and
you are in safe hands. All is well and the whole plan has
gone splendidly. We have announced that Le Chiffre
shot his two accomplices and then committed suicide
because he could not face an inquiry into the union funds.
Strasbourg and the north are in an uproar. He was considered
a great hero there and a pillar of the Communist
Party in France. This story of brothels and casinos has
absolutely knocked the bottom out of his organization and
they’re all running around like scalded cats. At the moment
the Communist Party is giving out that he was off
his head. But that hasn’t helped much after Thorez’s
breakdown not long ago. They’re just making it look as
if all their big shots were gaga. God knows how they’re
going to unscramble the whole business.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis saw that his enthusiasm had had the desired effect.
Bond’s eyes were brighter.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘One last mystery,’ Mathis said, ‘and then I promise I
will go.’ He looked at his watch. ‘The doctor will be
after my skin in a moment. Now, what about the money?
Where is it? Where did you hide it? We too have been
over your room with a toothcomb. It isn’t there.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond grinned.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It is,’ he said, ‘more or less. On the door of each room
there is a small square of black plastic with the number of
the room on it. On the corridor side, of course. When
Leiter left me that night, I simply opened the door and unscrewed
my number plate and put the folded cheque underneath
it and screwed the plate back. It’ll still be there.’
He smiled. ‘I’m glad there’s something the stupid English
can teach the clever French.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis laughed delightedly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I suppose you think that’s paid me back for knowing
what the Muntzes were up to. Well, I’ll call it quits. Incidentally,
we’ve got them in the bag. They were just some
minor fry hired for the occasion. We’ll see they get a few
years.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He rose hastily as the doctor stormed into the room and
took one look at Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Out,’ he said to Mathis. ‘Out and don’t come back.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis just had time to wave cheerfully to Bond and call
some hasty words of farewell before he was hustled through
the door. Bond heard a torrent of heated French diminishing
down the corridor. He lay back exhausted, but
heartened by all he had heard. He found himself
thinking of Vesper as he quickly drifted off into a
troubled sleep.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were still questions to be answered, but they could
wait.</p>
