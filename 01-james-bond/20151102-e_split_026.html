<p class="pindent">When he got back to his room he was touched to find
all his belongings put away and in the bathroom his
toothbrush and shaving things neatly arranged at one end
of the glass shelf over the wash-basin. At the other end was
Vesper’s toothbrush and one or two small bottles and a jar
of face-cream.</p>

<p class="pindent">He glanced at the bottles and was surprised to see that
one contained nembutal sleeping-pills. Perhaps her nerves
had been more shaken by the events at the villa than he
had imagined.</p>

<p class="pindent">The bath had been filled for him and there was a new
flask of some expensive pine bath-essence on a chair beside
it with his towel.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Vesper,’ he called.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You really are the limit. You make me feel like an
expensive gigolo.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I was told to look after you. I’m only doing what I was
told.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Darling, the bath’s absolutely right. Will you marry
me?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She snorted. ‘You need a slave, not a wife.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I want you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, I want my lobster and champagne, so hurry up.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right, all right,’ said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">He dried himself and dressed in a white shirt and dark
blue slacks. He hoped that she would be dressed as simply
and he was pleased when, without knocking, she appeared
in the doorway wearing a blue linen shirt which had faded
to the colour of her eyes and a dark red skirt in pleated
cotton.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I couldn’t wait. I was famished. My room’s over the
kitchen and I’ve been tortured by the wonderful smells.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He came over and put his arm round her.</p>

<p class="pindent">She took his hand and together they went downstairs
out on to the terrace where their table had been laid in the
light cast by the empty dining-room.</p>

<p class="pindent">The champagne which Bond had ordered on their arrival
stood on a plated wine-cooler beside their table and Bond
poured out two full glasses. Vesper busied herself with a
delicious home-made liver <span class="it">paté</span> and helped them both to the
crisp French bread and the thick square of deep yellow
butter set in chips of ice.</p>

<p class="pindent">They looked at each other and drank deeply and Bond
filled their glasses again to the rim.</p>

<p class="pindent">While they ate Bond told her of his bathe and they talked
of what they would do in the morning. All through the
meal they left unspoken their feelings for each other, but in
Vesper’s eyes as much as in Bond’s there was excited anticipation
of the night. They let their hands and their feet
touch from time to time as if to ease the tension in their
bodies.</p>

<p class="pindent">When the lobster had come and gone and the second
bottle of champagne was half-empty and they had just
ladled thick cream over their <span class="it">fraises des bois</span>, Vesper gave a
deep sigh of contentment.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m behaving like a pig,’ she said happily. ‘You always
give me all the things I like best. I’ve never been so
spoiled before.’ She gazed across the terrace at the moonlit
bay. ‘I wish I deserved it.’ Her voice had a wry undertone.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What do you mean?’ asked Bond surprised.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, I don’t know. I suppose people get what they
deserve, so perhaps I do deserve it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked at him and smiled. Her eyes narrowed quizzically.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You really don’t know much about me,’ she said
suddenly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was surprised by the undertone of seriousness in
her voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Quite enough,’ he said laughing. ‘All I need until
tomorrow and the next day and the next. You don’t know
much about me for the matter of that.’ He poured out
more champagne.</p>

<p class="pindent">Vesper looked at him thoughtfully.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘People are islands,’ she said. ‘They don’t really touch.
However close they are, they’re really quite separate. Even
if they’ve been married for fifty years.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond thought with dismay that she must be going into a
<span class="it">vin triste</span>. Too much champagne had made her melancholy.
But suddenly she gave a happy laugh. ‘Don’t look so
worried.’ She leaned forward and put her hand over his.
‘I was only being sentimental. Anyway, my island feels
very close to your island tonight.’ She took a sip of champagne.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed, relieved. ‘Let’s join up and make a peninsula,’
he said. ‘Now, directly we’ve finished the strawberries.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No,’ she said, flirting. ‘I must have coffee.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And brandy,’ countered Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">The small shadow had passed. The second small shadow.
This too left a tiny question-mark hanging in the air. It
quickly dissolved as warmth and intimacy enclosed them
again.</p>

<p class="pindent">When they had had their coffee and Bond was sipping
his brandy, Vesper picked up her bag and came and stood
behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m tired,’ she said, resting a hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p class="pindent">He reached up and held it there and they stayed motionless
for a moment. She bent down and lightly brushed his
hair with her lips. Then she was gone and a few seconds
later the light came on in her room.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smoked and waited until it had gone out. Then
he followed her, pausing only to say good night to the
proprietor and his wife and thank them for the dinner. They
exchanged compliments and he went upstairs.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was only half past nine when he stepped into her room
from the bathroom and closed the door behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">The moonlight shone through the half-closed shutters
and lapped at the secret shadows in the snow of her body
on the broad bed.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">Bond awoke in his own room at dawn and for a time he
lay and stroked his memories.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he got quietly out of bed and in his pyjama-coat he
crept past Vesper’s door and out of the house to the beach.</p>

<p class="pindent">The sea was smooth and quiet in the sunrise. The small
pink waves idly licked the sand. It was cold, but he took
off his jacket and wandered naked along the edge of the sea
to the point where he had bathed the evening before, then
he walked slowly and deliberately into the water until it
was just below his chin. He took his feet off the bottom and
sank, holding his nose with one hand and shutting his eyes,
feeling the cold water comb his body and his hair.</p>

<p class="pindent">The mirror of the bay was unbroken except where it
seemed a fish had jumped. Under the water he imagined
the tranquil scene and wished that Vesper could just then
come through the pines and be astonished to see him suddenly
erupt from the empty seascape.</p>

<p class="pindent">When after a full minute he came to the surface in a froth
of spray, he was disappointed. There was no one in sight.
For a time he swam and drifted and then when the sun
seemed hot enough, he came in to the beach and lay on his
back and revelled in the body which the night had given
back to him.</p>

<p class="pindent">As on the evening before, he stared up into the empty
sky and saw the same answer there.</p>

<p class="pindent">After a while he rose and walked back slowly along the
beach to his pyjama-coat.</p>

<p class="pindent">That day he would ask Vesper to marry him. He was
quite certain. It was only a question of choosing the right
moment.</p>
