<p class="pindent">There are moments of great luxury in the life of a
secret agent. There are assignments on which he is
required to act the part of a very rich man; occasions
when he takes refuge in good living to efface the
memory of danger and the shadow of death; and times
when, as was now the case, he is a guest in the territory
of an allied Secret Service.</p>

<p class="pindent">From the moment the BOAC Stratocruiser taxied
up to the International Air Terminal at Idlewild, James
Bond was treated like royalty.</p>

<p class="pindent">When he left the aircraft with the other passengers
he had resigned himself to the notorious purgatory of
the US Health, Immigration and Customs machinery.
At least an hour, he thought, of overheated, drab-green
rooms smelling of last year’s air and stale sweat and
guilt and the fear that hangs round all frontiers, fear of
those closed doors marked <span class="calibre4">PRIVATE</span> that hide the careful
men, the files, the teleprinters chattering urgently to
Washington, to the Bureau of Narcotics, Counter
Espionage, the Treasury, the FBI.</p>

<p class="pindent">As he walked across the tarmac in the bitter January
wind he saw his own name going over the network:
<span class="calibre4">BOND, JAMES. BRITISH DIPLOMATIC PASSPORT 0094567</span>,
the short wait and the replies coming back on the
different machines: <span class="calibre4">NEGATIVE</span>, <span class="calibre4">NEGATIVE</span>, <span class="calibre4">NEGATIVE</span>.
And then, from the FBI: <span class="calibre4">POSITIVE AWAIT CHECK</span>.
There would be some hasty traffic on the FBI circuit
with the Central Intelligence Agency and then: <span class="calibre4">FBI TO
IDLEWILD: BOND OKAY OKAY</span>, and the bland official
out front would hand him back his passport with a
‘Hope you enjoy your stay, Mr Bond.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shrugged his shoulders and followed the other
passengers through the wire fence towards the door
marked <span class="calibre4">US HEALTH SERVICE</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">In his case it was only a boring routine, of course,
but he disliked the idea of his dossier being in the
possession of any foreign power. Anonymity was the
chief tool of his trade. Every thread of his real identity
that went on record in any file diminished his value and,
ultimately, was a threat to his life. Here in America,
where they knew all about him, he felt like a negro whose
shadow has been stolen by the witch-doctor. A vital part
of himself was in pawn, in the hands of others. Friends,
of course, in this instance, but still . . .</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mr Bond?’</p>

<p class="pindent">A pleasant-looking nondescript man in plain clothes
had stepped forward from the shadow of the Health
Service building.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My name’s Halloran. Pleased to meet you!’</p>

<p class="pindent">They shook hands.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hope you had a pleasant trip. Would you follow me,
please?’</p>

<p class="pindent">He turned to the officer of the Airport police on
guard at the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Okay, Sergeant.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Okay, Mr Halloran. Be seeing you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The other passengers had passed inside. Halloran
turned to the left, away from the building. Another
policeman held open a small gate in the high boundary
fence.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘ ’Bye, Mr Halloran.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘ ’Bye, Officer. Thanks.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Directly outside a black Buick waited, its engine
sighing quietly. They climbed in. Bond’s two light suitcases
were in front next to the driver. Bond couldn’t
imagine how they had been extracted so quickly from
the mound of passengers’ luggage he had seen only
minutes before being trolleyed over to Customs.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Okay, Grady. Let’s go.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sank back luxuriously as the big limousine
surged forward, slipping quickly into top through the
Dynaflow gears.</p>

<p class="pindent">He turned to Halloran.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, that’s certainly one of the reddest carpets I’ve
ever seen. I expected to be at least an hour getting through
Immigration. Who laid it on? I’m not used to VIP treatment.
Anyway, thanks very much for your part in it all.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’re very welcome, Mr Bond.’ Halloran smiled and
offered him a cigarette from a fresh pack of Luckies.
‘We want to make your stay comfortable. Anything you
want, just say so and it’s yours. You’ve got some good
friends in Washington. I don’t myself know why you’re
here but it seems the authorities are keen that you should
be a privileged guest of the Government. It’s my job
to see you get to your hotel as quickly and as comfortably
as possible and then I’ll hand over and be on my
way. May I have your passport a moment, please?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gave it to him. Halloran opened a brief-case
on the seat beside him and took out a heavy metal
stamp. He turned the pages of Bond’s passport until
he came to the US Visa, stamped it, scribbled his signature
over the dark blue circle of the Department of
Justice cypher and gave it back to him. Then he took
out his pocket-book and extracted a thick white envelope
which he gave to Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There’s a thousand dollars in there, Mr Bond.’ He
held up his hand as Bond started to speak. ‘And it’s
Communist money we took in the Schmidt-Kinaski
haul. We’re using it back at them and you are asked to
co-operate and spend this in any way you like on your
present assignment. I am advised that it will be considered
a very unfriendly act if you refuse. Let’s please say
no more about it and,’ he added, as Bond continued to
hold the envelope dubiously in his hand, ‘I am also to
say that the disposal of this money through your hands
has the knowledge and approval of your own Chief.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond eyed him narrowly and then grinned. He put
the envelope away in his notecase.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right,’ he said. ‘And thanks. I’ll try and spend it
where it does most harm. I’m glad to have some working
capital. It’s certainly good to know it’s been provided
by the opposition.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Fine,’ said Halloran; ‘and now, if you’ll forgive me,
I’ll just write up my notes for the report I’ll have to put
in. Have to remember to get a letter of thanks sent to
Immigration and Customs and so forth for their co-operation.
Routine.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Go ahead,’ said Bond. He was glad to keep silent
and gaze out at his first sight of America since the war.
It was no waste of time to start picking up the American
idiom again: the advertisements, the new car models
and the prices of second-hand ones in the used-car lots;
the exotic pungency of the road signs: <span class="calibre4">SOFT SHOULDERS</span>—<span class="calibre4">SHARP
CURVES</span>—<span class="calibre4">SQUEEZE AHEAD</span>—<span class="calibre4">SLIPPERY WHEN
WET</span>; the standard of driving; the number of women
at the wheel, their menfolk docilely beside them; the
men’s clothes; the way the women were doing their hair;
the Civil Defence warnings: <span class="calibre4">IN CASE OF ENEMY ATTACK</span>—<span class="calibre4">KEEP
MOVING</span>—<span class="calibre4">GET OFF BRIDGE</span>; the thick rash of
television aerials and the impact of TV on hoardings
and shop windows; the occasional helicopter; the public
appeals for cancer and polio funds: <span class="calibre4">THE MARCH OF
DIMES</span>—all the small, fleeting impressions that were as
important to his trade as are broken bark and bent twigs
to the trapper in the jungle.</p>

<p class="pindent">The driver chose the Triborough Bridge and they
soared across the breath-taking span into the heart of
uptown Manhattan, the beautiful prospect of New York
hastening towards them until they were down amongst
the hooting, teeming, petrol-smelling roots of the
stressed-concrete jungle.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned to his companion.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I hate to say it,’ he said, ‘but this must be the fattest
atomic-bomb target on the whole face of the globe.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nothing to touch it,’ agreed Halloran. ‘Keeps me
awake nights thinking what would happen.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They drew up at the best hotel in New York, the St
Regis, at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 55th Street.
A saturnine middle-aged man in a dark blue overcoat
and black homburg came forward behind the commissionaire.
On the sidewalk, Halloran introduced him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mr Bond, meet Captain Dexter.’ He was deferential.
‘Can I pass him along to you now, Captain?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sure, sure. Just have his bags sent up. Room 2100.
Top floor. I’ll go ahead with Mr Bond and see he has
everything he wants.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned to say goodbye to Halloran and thank
him. For a moment Halloran had his back to him as
he said something about Bond’s luggage to the commissionaire.
Bond looked past him across 55th Street. His
eyes narrowed. A black sedan, a Chevrolet, was pulling
sharply out into the thick traffic, right in front of a
Checker cab that braked hard, its driver banging his fist
down on the horn and holding it there. The sedan kept
going, just caught the tail of the green light, and disappeared
north up Fifth Avenue.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a smart, decisive bit of driving, but what startled
Bond was that it had been a negress at the wheel,
a fine-looking negress in a black chauffeur’s uniform,
and through the rear window he had caught a glimpse
of the single passenger—a huge grey-black face which
had turned slowly towards him and looked directly back
at him, Bond was sure of it, as the car accelerated
towards the Avenue.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shook Halloran by the hand. Dexter touched
his elbow impatiently.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We’ll go straight in and through the lobby to the
elevators. Half-right across the lobby. And would you
please keep your hat on, Mr Bond.’</p>

<p class="pindent">As Bond followed Dexter up the steps into the hotel
he reflected that it was almost certainly too late for
these precautions. Hardly anywhere in the world will
you find a negress driving a car. A negress acting as a
chauffeur is still more extraordinary. Barely conceivable
even in Harlem, but that was certainly where the car
was from.</p>

<p class="pindent">And the giant shape in the back seat? That grey-black
face? Mr Big?</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hm,’ said Bond to himself as he followed the slim
back of Captain Dexter into the elevator.</p>

<p class="pindent">The elevator slowed up for the twenty-first floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We’ve got a little surprise ready for you, Mr Bond,’
said Captain Dexter, without, Bond thought, much
enthusiasm.</p>

<p class="pindent">They walked down the corridor to the corner
room.</p>

<p class="pindent">The wind sighed outside the passage windows and
Bond had a fleeting view of the tops of other skyscrapers
and, beyond, the stark fingers of the trees in Central
Park. He felt far out of touch with the ground and for
a moment a strange feeling of loneliness and empty
space gripped his heart.</p>

<p class="pindent">Dexter unlocked the door of No. 2100 and shut it
behind them. They were in a small lighted lobby. They
left their hats and coats on a chair and Dexter opened
the door in front of them and held it for Bond to go
through.</p>

<p class="pindent">He walked into an attractive sitting-room decorated
in Third Avenue ‘Empire’—comfortable chairs and a
broad sofa in pale yellow silk, a fair copy of an Aubusson
on the floor, pale grey walls and ceiling, a bow-fronted
French sideboard with bottles and glasses and a plated
ice-bucket, a wide window through which the winter
sun poured out of a Swiss-clear sky. The central heating
was just bearable.</p>

<p class="pindent">The communicating door with the bedroom opened.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Arranging the flowers by your bed. Part of the
famous CIA “Service With a Smile”.’ The tall thin
young man came forward with a wide grin, his hand
outstretched, to where Bond stood rooted with astonishment.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Felix Leiter! What the hell are you doing here?’ Bond
grasped the hard hand and shook it warmly. ‘And what
the hell are you doing in my bedroom, anyway? God!
It’s good to see you. Why aren’t you in Paris? Don’t tell
me they’ve put you on this job?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter examined the Englishman affectionately.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’ve said it. That’s just exactly what they have
done. What a break! At least, it is for me. CIA thought
we did all right together on the Casino job<a id="r1_1"></a><a href="#f1_1" class="calibre5"><sup class="calibre6"><span class="calibre7">[1]</span></sup></a> so they
hauled me away from the Joint Intelligence chaps in
Paris, put me through the works in Washington and
here I am. I’m sort of liaison between the Central Intelligence
Agency and our friends of the FBI.’ He waved
towards Captain Dexter, who was watching this unprofessional
ebullience without enthusiasm. ‘It’s their case,
of course, at least the American end of it is, but as you
know there are some big overseas angles which are
CIA’s territory, so we’re running it joint. Now you’re
here to handle the Jamaican end for the British and the
team’s complete. How does it look to you? Sit down
and let’s have a drink. I ordered lunch directly I got the
word you were downstairs and it’ll be on its way.’ He
went over to the sideboard and started mixing a
Martini.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, I’m damned,’ said Bond. ‘Of course that old
devil M never told me. He just gives one the facts.
Never tells one any good news. I suppose he thinks it
might influence one’s decision to take a case or not.
Anyway, it’s grand.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond suddenly felt the silence of Captain Dexter. He
turned to him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I shall be very glad to be under your orders here,
Captain,’ he said tactfully. ‘As I understand it, the case
breaks pretty neatly into two halves. The first half lies
wholly on American territory. Your jurisdiction, of
course. Then it looks as if we shall have to follow it
into the Caribbean. Jamaica. And I understand I am to
take over outside United States territorial waters. Felix
here will marry up the two halves so far as your government
is concerned. I shall report to London through
CIA while I’m here, and direct to London, keeping CIA
informed, when I move to the Caribbean. Is that how
you see it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Dexter smiled thinly. ‘That’s just about it, Mr Bond.
Mr Hoover instructs me to say that he’s very pleased
to have you along. As our guest,’ he added. ‘Naturally
we are not in any way concerned with the British end
of the case and we’re very happy that CIA will be
handling that with you and your people in London.
Guess everything should go fine. Here’s luck,’ and he
lifted the cocktail Leiter had put into his hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">They drank the cold hard drink appreciatively, Leiter
with a faintly quizzical expression on his hawk-like face.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a knock on the door. Leiter opened it to
let in the bellboy with Bond’s suitcases. He was followed
by two waiters pushing trolleys loaded with covered
dishes, cutlery and snow-white linen, which they
proceeded to lay out on a folding table.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Soft-shell crabs with tartare sauce, flat beef
Hamburgers, medium-rare, from the charcoal grill,
French-fried potatoes, broccoli, mixed salad with
thousand-island dressing, ice-cream with melted butterscotch
and as good a Liebfraumilch as you can get in
America. Okay?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It sounds fine,’ said Bond with a mental reservation
about the melted butterscotch.</p>

<p class="pindent">They sat down and ate steadily through each delicious
course of American cooking at its rare best.</p>

<p class="pindent">They said little, and it was only when the coffee had
been brought and the table cleared away that Captain
Dexter took the fifty-cent cigar from his mouth and
cleared his throat decisively.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mr Bond,’ he said, ‘now perhaps you would tell us
what you know about this case.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond slit open a fresh pack of King Size Chesterfields
with his thumb-nail and, as he settled back in his
comfortable chair in the warm luxurious room, his mind
went back two weeks to the bitter raw day in early
January when he had walked out of his Chelsea flat
into the dreary half-light of a London fog.</p>
