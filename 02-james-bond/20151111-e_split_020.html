<p class="pindent">Strangways went back alone after dinner and Bond
agreed that they would follow at first light. Strangways
left him a fresh pile of books and pamphlets on shark
and barracuda and Bond went through them with rapt
attention.</p>

<p class="pindent">They added little to the practical lore he had picked
up from Quarrel. They were all by scientists and much
of the data on attacks was from the beaches of the
Pacific where a flashing body in the thick surf would
excite any inquisitive fish.</p>

<p class="pindent">But there seemed to be general agreement that the
danger to underwater swimmers with breathing equipment
was far less than to surface swimmers. They might
be attacked by almost any of the shark family, particularly
when the shark was stimulated and excited by
blood in the water, by the smell of a swimmer or by
the sensory vibration set up by an injured person in
the water. But they could sometimes be frightened off,
he read, by loud noises in the water—even by shouting
below the surface—and they would often flee if a
swimmer chased them.</p>

<p class="pindent">The most successful form of shark repellent,
according to US Naval Research Laboratory tests, was
a combination of copper acetate and a dark nigrosine
dye, and cakes of this mixture were apparently now
attached to the Mae Wests of all the US Armed
Forces.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond called in Quarrel. The Cayman Islander was
scornful until Bond read out to him what the Navy
Department had to say about their researches at the
end of the war among packs of sharks stimulated by
what was described as ‘extreme mob behaviour conditions’:
‘. . . Sharks were attracted to the back of the
shrimp boat with trash fish,’ read out Bond. ‘Sharks
appeared as a slashing, splashing shoal. We prepared a
tub of fresh fish and another tub of fish mixed with
repellent powder. We got up to the shoal of sharks and
the photographer started his camera. I shovelled over
the plain fish for thirty seconds while the sharks, with
much splashing, ate them. Then I started on the repellent
fish and shovelled for thirty seconds, repeating the
procedure three times. On the first trial the sharks were
quite ferocious in feeding on plain fish right at the stern
of the boat. They cut fish for only about five seconds
after the repellent mixture was thrown over. A few came
back when the plain fish were put out immediately
following the repellent. On a second trial thirty minutes
later, a ferocious school fed for the thirty seconds that
plain fish were supplied, but left as soon as the repellent
struck the water. There were no attacks on fish while
the repellent was in the water. On the third trial we
could not get the sharks nearer than twenty yards of
the stern of the boat.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What do you make of that?’ asked Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You better have some of dat stuff,’ said Quarrel,
impressed against his will.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was inclined to agree with him. Washington
had cabled that cakes of the stuff were on the way. But
they had not yet arrived and were not expected for
another forty-eight hours. If the repellent did not arrive,
Bond was not dismayed. He could not imagine that he
would encounter such dangerous conditions in his
underwater swim to the island.</p>

<p class="pindent">Before he went to bed, he finally decided that nothing
would attack him unless there was blood in the water
or unless he communicated fear to a fish that threatened.
As for octopus, scorpion fish and morays, he would
just have to watch where he put his feet. To his mind,
the three-inch spines of the black sea-eggs were the
greatest hazard to normal underwater swimming in the
tropics and the pain they caused would not be enough
to interfere with his plans.</p>

<p class="pindent">They left before six in the morning and were at Beau
Desert by half-past ten.</p>

<p class="pindent">The property was a beautiful old plantation of about
a thousand acres with the ruins of a fine Great House
commanding the bay. It was given over to pimento and
citrus inside a fringe of hardwoods and palms and had
a history dating back to the time of Cromwell. The
romantic name was in the fashion of the eighteenth
century, when Jamaican properties were called Bellair,
Bellevue, Boscobel, Harmony, Nymphenburg or had
names like Prospect, Content or Repose.</p>

<p class="pindent">A track, out of sight of the island in the bay, led
them among the trees down to the little beach-house.
After the week’s picnic at Manatee Bay, the bathrooms
and comfortable bamboo furniture seemed very luxurious
and the brightly coloured rugs were like velvet
under Bond’s hardened feet.</p>

<p class="pindent">Through the slats of the jalousies Bond looked across
the little garden, aflame with hibiscus, bougainvillea and
roses, which ended in the tiny crescent of white sand
half obscured by the trunks of the palms. He sat on
the arm of a chair and let his eyes go on, inch by inch,
across the different blues and browns of sea and reef
until they met the base of the island. The upper half
of it was obscured by the dipping feathers of the palm
trees in the foreground, but the stretch of vertical cliff
within his vision looked grey and formidable in the
half-shadow cast by the hot sun.</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel cooked lunch on a primus stove so that no
smoke would betray them, and in the afternoon Bond
slept and then went over the gear from London that
had been sent across from Kingston by Strangways. He
tried on the thin black rubber frogman’s suit that covered
him from the skull-tight helmet with the Perspex
window to the long black flippers over his feet. It fitted
like a glove and Bond blessed the efficiency of M’s ‘Q’
Branch.</p>

<p class="pindent">They tested the twin cylinders, each containing a
thousand litres of free air compressed to two hundred
atmospheres, and Bond found the manipulation of the
demand valve and the reserve mechanism simple and
fool-proof. At the depth he would be working the supply
of air would last him for nearly two hours underwater.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a new and powerful Champion harpoon
gun and a commando dagger of the type devised by
Wilkinsons during the war. Finally, in a box covered
with danger-labels, there was the heavy limpet mine, a
flat cone of explosive on a base, studded with wide
copper bosses, so powerfully magnetized that the mine
would stick like a clam to any metal hull. There were a
dozen pencil-shaped metal and glass fuses set for ten
minutes to eight hours and a careful memorandum of
instructions that were as simple as the rest of the gear.
There was even a box of benzedrine tablets to give
endurance and heightened perception during the operation
and an assortment of underwater torches, including
one that threw only a tiny pencil-thin beam.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond and Quarrel went through everything, testing
joints and contacts until they were satisfied that nothing
further remained to be done, then Bond went down
among the trees and gazed and gazed at the waters of
the bay, guessing at depths, tracing routes through the
broken reef and estimating the path of the moon, which
would be his only point of reckoning on the tortuous
journey.</p>

<p class="pindent">At five o’clock, Strangways arrived with news of the
<span class="it">Secatur</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘They’ve cleared Port Maria,’ he said. ‘They’ll be here
in ten minutes at the outside. Mr Big had a passport in
the name of Gallia and the girl in the name of Latrelle,
Simone Latrelle. She was in her cabin, prostrate with
what the negro captain of the <span class="it">Secatur</span> described as sea-sickness.
It may have been. Scores of empty fish-tanks
on board. More than a hundred. Otherwise nothing
suspicious and they were given a clean bill. I wanted to
go on board as one of the Customs team but I thought
it best that the show should be absolutely normal. Mr
Big stuck to his cabin. He was reading when they went
to see his papers. How’s the gear?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Perfect,’ said Bond. ‘Guess we’ll operate tomorrow
night. Hope there’s a bit of a wind. If the air-bubbles
are spotted we shall be in a mess.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel came in. ‘She’s coming through the reef now,
Cap’n.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They went down as close to the shore as they dared
and put their glasses on her.</p>

<p class="pindent">She was a handsome craft, black with a grey superstructure,
seventy foot long and built for speed—at
least twenty knots, Bond guessed. He knew her history,
built for a millionaire in 1947 and powered with twin
General Motors Diesels, steel hull and all the latest
wireless gadgets, including ship-to-shore telephone and
Decca navigator. She was wearing the Red Ensign at
her cross-trees and the Stars and Stripes aft and she
was making about three knots through the twenty-foot
opening of the reef.</p>

<p class="pindent">She turned sharply inside the reef and came down
to seaward of the island. When she was below it, she
put her helm hard over and came up with the island
to port. At the same time three negroes in white ducks
came running down the cliff steps to the narrow jetty
and stood by to catch lines. There was a minimum
of backing and filling before she was made fast just
opposite to the watchers ashore, and the two anchors
roared down among the rocks and coral scattered
round the island’s foundations in the sand. She lay
well secured even against a ‘Norther’. Bond estimated
there would be about twenty feet of water below her
keel.</p>

<p class="pindent">As they watched, the huge figure of Mr Big appeared
on deck. He stepped on to the jetty and started slowly
to climb the steep cliff steps. He paused often, and
Bond thought of the diseased heart pumping laboriously
in the great grey-black body.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was followed by two negro members of the crew
hauling up a light stretcher on which a body was
strapped. Through his glasses Bond could see Solitaire’s
black hair. Bond was worried and puzzled and he felt
a tightening of the heart at her nearness. He prayed the
stretcher was only a precaution to prevent Solitaire from
being recognized from the shore.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then a chain of twelve men was established up the
steps and the fish-tanks were handed up one by one.
Quarrel counted a hundred and twenty of them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then some stores went up by the same method.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not taking much up this time,’ commented Strangways
when the operation ceased. ‘Only half a dozen cases
gone up. Generally about fifty. Can’t be staying long.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He had hardly finished speaking before a fish-tank,
which their glasses showed was half full of water and
sand, was being gingerly passed back to the ship, down
the human ladder of hands. Then another and another,
at about five-minute intervals.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My God,’ said Strangways. ‘They’re loading her up
already. That means they’ll be sailing in the morning.
Wonder if it means they’ve decided to clean the place
out and that this is the last cargo.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond watched carefully for a while and then they
walked quietly up through the trees, leaving Quarrel to
report developments.</p>

<p class="pindent">They sat down in the living-room, and while Strangways
mixed himself a whisky-and-soda, Bond gazed
out of the window and marshalled his thoughts.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was six o’clock and the fireflies were beginning to
show in the shadows. The pale primrose moon was already
high up in the eastern sky and the day was dying swiftly
at their backs. A light breeze was ruffling the bay and the
scrolls of small waves were unfurling on the white beach
across the lawn. A few small clouds, pink and orange in
the sunset, were meandering by overhead and the palm
trees clashed softly in the cool Undertaker’s Wind.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Undertaker’s Wind,’ thought Bond and smiled wryly.
So it would have to be tonight. The only chance, and
the conditions were so nearly perfect. Except that the
shark-repellent stuff would not arrive in time. And that
was only a refinement. There was no excuse. This was
what he had travelled two thousand miles and five deaths
to do. And yet he shivered at the prospect of the dark
adventure under the sea that he had already put off in
his mind until tomorrow. Suddenly he loathed and feared
the sea and everything in it. The millions of tiny
antennae that would stir and point as he went by that
night, the eyes that would wake and watch him, the
pulses that would miss for the hundredth of a second
and then go beating quietly on, the jelly tendrils that
would grope and reach for him, as blind in the light as
in the dark.</p>

<p class="pindent">He would be walking through thousands of millions
of secrets. In three hundred yards, alone and cold, he
would be blundering through a forest of mystery
towards a deadly citadel whose guardians had already
killed three men. He, Bond, after a week’s paddling with
his nanny beside him in the sunshine, was going out
tonight, in a few hours, to walk alone under that black
sheet of water. It was crazy, unthinkable. Bond’s flesh
cringed and his fingers dug into his wet palms.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a knock on the door and Quarrel came
in. Bond was glad to get up and move away from the
window to where Strangways was enjoying his drink
under a shaded reading light.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘They’re working with lights now, Cap’n,’ Quarrel said
with a grin. ‘Still a tank every five minutes. I figure
that’ll be ten hours’ work. Be through about four in the
morning. Won’t sail before six. Too dangerous to try
the passage without plenty light.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel’s warm grey eyes in the splendid mahogany
face were looking into Bond’s, waiting for orders.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ll start at ten sharp,’ Bond found himself saying.
‘From the rocks to the left of the beach. Can you get
us some dinner and then get the gear out on to the
lawn? Conditions are perfect. I’ll be over there in half
an hour.’ He counted on his fingers. ‘Give me fuses for
five to eight hours. And the quarter-hour one in reserve
in case anything goes wrong. Okay?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Aye aye, Cap’n,’ said Quarrel. ‘You jes leave ’em all
to me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He went out.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked at the whisky bottle, then he made up
his mind and poured half a glass on top of three ice
cubes. He took the box of benzedrine tablets out of
his pocket and slipped a tablet between his teeth.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Here’s luck,’ he said to Strangways and took a deep
swallow. He sat down and enjoyed the tough hot taste
of his first drink for more than a week. ‘Now,’ he said,
‘tell me exactly what they do when they’re ready to sail.
How long it takes them to clear the island and get
through the reef. If it’s the last time, don’t forget they’ll
be taking off an extra six men and some stores. Let’s
try to work it out as closely as we can.’</p>

<p class="pindent">In a moment Bond was immersed in a sea of practical
details and the shadow of fear had fled back to the dark
pools under the palm trees.</p>

<p class="pindent">Exactly at ten o’clock, with nothing but anticipation
and excitement in him, the shimmering black bat-like
figure slipped off the rocks into ten feet of water and
vanished under the sea.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Go safely,’ said Quarrel to the spot where Bond had
disappeared. He crossed himself. Then he and Strangways
moved back through the shadows to the house to
sleep uneasily in watches and wait fearfully for what
might come.</p>
