<p class="pindent">Their footsteps echoed down the stone passage. At the
end there was a door. They went through into another
long passage lit by an occasional bare bulb in the roof.
Another door and they found themselves in a large
warehouse. Cases and bales were stacked in neat piles.
There were runways for overhead cranes. From the
markings on the crates it seemed to be a liquor store.
They followed an aisle across to an iron door. The man
called Tee-Hee rang a bell. There was absolute silence.
Bond guessed they must have walked at least a block
away from the nightclub.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a clang of bolts and the door opened. A
negro in evening dress with a gun in his hand stepped
aside and they went through into a carpeted hallway.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yo kin go on in, Tee-Hee,’ said the man in evening
dress.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tee-Hee knocked on a door facing them, opened it
and led the way through.</p>

<p class="pindent">In a high-backed chair, behind an expensive desk, Mr
Big sat looking quietly at them.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good morning, Mister James Bond.’ The voice was
deep and soft. ‘Sit down.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s guard led him across the thick carpet to a low
armchair in leather and tubular steel. He released Bond’s
arms and Bond sat down and faced The Big Man across
the wide desk.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a blessed relief to be rid of the two vice-like
hands. All sensation had left Bond’s forearms. He let
them hang beside him and welcomed the dull pain as
the blood started to flow again.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Big sat looking at him, his huge head resting
against the back of the tall chair. He said nothing.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond at once realized that the photographs had
conveyed nothing of this man, nothing of the power
and the intellect which seemed to radiate from him,
nothing of the over-size features.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a great football of a head, twice the normal
size and very nearly round. The skin was grey-black,
taut and shining like the face of a week-old corpse in
the river. It was hairless, except for some grey-brown
fluff above the ears. There were no eyebrows and no
eyelashes and the eyes were extraordinarily far apart so
that one could not focus on them both, but only on
one at a time. Their gaze was very steady and penetrating.
When they rested on something, they seemed
to devour it, to encompass the whole of it. They bulged
slightly and the irises were golden round black pupils
which were now wide. They were animal eyes, not
human, and they seemed to blaze.</p>

<p class="pindent">The nose was wide without being particularly negroid.
The nostrils did not gape at you. The lips were only
slightly everted, but thick and dark. They opened only
when the man spoke and then they opened wide and
drew back from the teeth and the pale pink gums.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were few wrinkles or creases on the face, but
there were two deep clefts above the nose, the clefts
of concentration. Above them the forehead bulged
slightly before merging with the polished, hairless
crown.</p>

<p class="pindent">Curiously, there was nothing disproportionate about
the monstrous head. It was carried on a wide, short
neck supported by the shoulders of a giant. Bond knew
from the records that he was six and a half foot tall
and weighed twenty stone, and that little of it was fat.
But the total impression was awe-inspiring, even terrifying,
and Bond could imagine that so ghastly a misfit
must have been bent since childhood on revenge against
fate and against the world that hated him because it
feared him.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Big Man was draped in a dinner-jacket. There
was a hint of vanity in the diamonds that blazed on his
shirt-front and at his cuffs. His huge flat hands rested
half-curled on the table in front of him. There were no
signs of cigarettes or an ash-tray and the smell of the
room was neutral. There was nothing on the desk save
a large intercom with about twenty switches and, incongruously,
a very small ivory riding-crop with a long thin
white lash.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Big gazed with silent and deep concentration
across the table at Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">After inspecting him carefully in return, Bond glanced
round the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was full of books, spacious and restful and very
quiet, like the library of a millionaire.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was one high window above Mr Big’s head but
otherwise the walls were solid with bookshelves. Bond
turned round in his chair. More bookshelves, packed
with books. There was no sign of a door, but there
might have been any number of doors faced with
dummy books. The two negroes who had brought him
to the room stood rather uneasily against the wall behind
his chair. The whites of their eyes showed. They were
not looking at Mr Big, but at a curious effigy which
stood on a table in an open space of floor to the right,
and slightly behind Mr Big.</p>

<p class="pindent">Even with his slight knowledge of Voodoo, Bond
recognized it at once from Leigh Fermor’s description.</p>

<p class="pindent">A five-foot white wooden cross stood on a raised
white pedestal. The arms of the cross were thrust into
the sleeves of a dusty black frock-coat whose tails hung
down behind the table towards the floor. Above the
neck of the coat a battered bowler hat gaped at him,
its crown pierced by the vertical bar of the cross. A
few inches below the rim, round the neck of the cross,
resting on the cross-bar, was a deep starched clergyman’s
collar.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the base of the white pedestal, on the table, lay
an old pair of lemon-coloured gloves. A short malacca
stick with a gold knob, its ferrule resting beside the
gloves, rose against the left shoulder of the effigy. Also
on the table was a battered black top hat.</p>

<p class="pindent">This evil scarecrow gazed out across the room—God
of the Cemeteries and Chief of the Legion of the Dead—Baron
Samedi. Even to Bond it seemed to carry a
dreadful gaping message.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked away, back to the great grey-black face
across the desk.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Big spoke.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I want you, Tee-Hee.’ His eyes shifted. ‘You can go,
Miami.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, Sir, Boss,’ they both said together.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond heard a door open and close.</p>

<p class="pindent">Silence fell again. At first, Mr Big’s eyes had been
focused sharply on Bond. They had examined him
minutely. Now, Bond noticed that though the eyes rested
on him they had become slightly opaque. They gazed
upon Bond without perception. Bond had the impression
that the brain behind them was occupied
elsewhere.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was determined not to be disconcerted. Feeling
had returned to his hands and he moved them towards
his body to reach for his cigarettes and lighter.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Big spoke.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You may smoke, Mister Bond. In case you have any
other intentions you may care to lean forward and
inspect the keyhole of the drawer in this desk facing
your chair. I shall be ready for you in a moment.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond leant forward. It was a large keyhole. In fact,
Bond estimated, .45 of an inch in diameter. Fired, Bond
supposed, by a foot-switch under the desk. What a
bunch of tricks this man was. Puerile. Puerile? Perhaps,
after all, not to be dismissed so easily. The tricks—the
bomb, the disappearing table—had worked neatly,
efficiently. They had not been just empty conceits,
designed to impress. Again, there was nothing absurd
about this gun. Rather painstaking, perhaps, but, he had
to admit, technically sound.</p>

<p class="pindent">He lit a cigarette and gratefully drew the smoke deep
into his lungs. He did not feel particularly worried by
his position. He refused to believe he would come to
any harm. It would be a clumsy affair to have him
disappear a couple of days after he arrived from England
unless a very expert accident could be contrived. And
Leiter would have to be disposed of at the same time.
That would be altogether too much for their two
Services and Mr Big must know it. But he was worried
about Leiter in the hands of those clumsy black apes.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Big Man’s lips rolled slowly back from his
teeth.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I have not seen a member of the Secret Service for
many years, Mister Bond. Not since the war. Your
Service did well in the war. You have some able men.
I learn from my friends that you are high up in your
Service. You have a double-0 number, I believe—007,
if I remember right. The significance of that double-0
number, they tell me, is that you have had to kill a man
in the course of some assignment. There cannot be
many double-0 numbers in a Service which does not
use assassination as a weapon. Whom have you been
sent over to kill here, Mister Bond? Not me by any
chance?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The voice was soft and even, without expression.
There was a slight mixture of accents, American and
French, but the English was almost pedantically accurate,
without a trace of slang.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond remained silent. He assumed that Moscow had
signalled his description.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It is necessary for you to reply, Mister Bond. The
fate of both of you depends upon your doing so. I
have confidence in the sources of my information. I
know much more than I have said. I shall easily detect
a lie.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond believed him. He chose a story he could support
and which would cover the facts.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There are English gold coins circulating in America.
Edward IV Rose Nobles,’ he said. ‘Some have been
sold in Harlem. The American Treasury asked for
assistance in tracing them since they must come from
a British source. I came up to Harlem to see for
myself, with a representative of the American Treasury,
who I hope is now safely on his way back to his
hotel.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mr Leiter is a representative of the Central Intelligence
Agency, not of the Treasury,’ said Mr Big without
emotion. ‘His position at this moment is extremely
precarious.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He paused and seemed to reflect. He looked past
Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Tee-Hee.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yassuh, Boss.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Tie Mr Bond to his chair.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond half rose to his feet.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t move, Mister Bond,’ said the voice softly. ‘You
have a bare chance of survival if you stay where
you are.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked at The Big Man, at the golden, impassive
eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">He lowered himself back into his chair. Immediately
a broad strap was passed round his body and buckled
tight. Two short straps went round his wrists and tied
them to the leather and metal arms. Two more went
round his ankles. He could hurl himself and the chair
to the floor, but otherwise he was powerless.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Big pressed down a switch on the intercom.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Send in Miss Solitaire,’ he said and centred the switch
again.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a moment’s pause and then a section of
the bookcase to the right of the desk swung open.</p>

<p class="pindent">One of the most beautiful women Bond had ever
seen came slowly in and closed the door behind her.
She stood just inside the room and stood looking at
Bond, taking him in slowly inch by inch, from his head
to his feet. When she had completed her detailed inspection,
she turned to Mr Big.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes?’ she inquired flatly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Big had not moved his head. He addressed Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘This is an extraordinary woman, Mister Bond,’ he
said in the same quiet, soft voice, ‘and I am going to
marry her because she is unique. I found her in a cabaret
in Haiti, where she was born. She was doing a telepathic
act which I could not understand. I looked into it and
I still could not understand. There was nothing to understand.
It was telepathy.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Big paused.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I tell you this to warn you. She is my inquisitor.
Torture is messy and inconclusive. People tell you what
will ease the pain. With this girl it is not necessary to
use clumsy methods. She can divine the truth in people.
That is why she is to be my wife. She is too valuable
to remain at liberty. And,’ he continued blandly, ‘it will
be interesting to see our children.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Big turned towards her and gazed at her impassively.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘For the time being she is difficult. She will have
nothing to do with men. That is why, in Haiti, she was
called “Solitaire”.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Draw up a chair,’ he said quietly to her. ‘Tell me if
this man lies. Keep clear of the gun,’ he added.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl said nothing but took a chair similar to Bond’s
from beside the wall and pushed it towards him. She
sat down, almost touching his right knee. She looked
into his eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">Her face was pale, with the pallor of white families
that have lived long in the tropics. But it contained no
trace of the usual exhaustion which the tropics impart
to the skin and hair. The eyes were blue, alight and
disdainful, but, as they gazed into his with a touch of
humour, he realized they contained some message for
him personally. It quickly vanished as his own eyes
answered. Her hair was blue-black and fell heavily to
her shoulders. She had high cheekbones and a wide,
sensual mouth which held a hint of cruelty. Her jawline
was delicate and finely cut. It showed decision and an
iron will which were repeated in the straight, pointed
nose. Part of the beauty of the face lay in its lack of
compromise. It was a face born to command. The face
of the daughter of a French Colonial slave-owner.</p>

<p class="pindent">She wore a long evening dress of heavy white matt
silk whose classical line was broken by the deep folds
which fell from her shoulders and revealed the upper
half of her breasts. She wore diamond earrings, square-cut
in broken bands, and a thin diamond bracelet on
her left wrist. She wore no rings. Her nails were short
and without enamel.</p>

<p class="pindent">She watched his eyes on her and nonchalantly drew
her forearms together in her lap so that the valley
between her breasts deepened.</p>

<p class="pindent">The message was unmistakable and an answering
warmth must have showed on Bond’s cold, drawn face,
for suddenly The Big Man picked up the small ivory
whip from the desk beside him and lashed across at
her, the thong whistling through the air and landing
with a cruel bite across her shoulders.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond winced even more than she did. Her eyes blazed
for an instant and then went opaque.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sit up,’ said The Big Man softly, ‘you forget yourself.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She sat slowly more upright. She had a pack of cards
in her hands and she started to shuffle them. Then, out
of bravado perhaps, she sent him yet another message—of
complicity and of more than complicity.</p>

<p class="pindent">Between her hands, she faced the knave of hearts.
Then the queen of spades. She held the two halves of
the pack in her lap so that the two court cards looked
at each other. She brought the two halves of the pack
together until they kissed. Then she riffled the cards
and shuffled them again.</p>

<p class="pindent">At no moment of this dumb show did she look at
Bond, and it was all over in an instant. But Bond felt
a glow of excitement and a quickening of the pulse.
He had a friend in the enemy’s camp.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Are you ready, Solitaire?’ asked The Big Man.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, the cards are ready,’ said the girl, in a low, cool
voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mister Bond, look into the eyes of this girl and repeat
the reason for your presence here which you gave me
just now.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked into her eyes. There was no message.
They were not focused on his. They looked through
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">He repeated what he had said.</p>

<p class="pindent">For a moment he felt an uncanny thrill. Could this
girl tell? If she could tell, would she speak for him or
against him?</p>

<p class="pindent">For a moment there was dead silence in the room.
Bond tried to look indifferent. He gazed up at the ceiling—then
back at her.</p>

<p class="pindent">Her eyes came back into focus. She turned away from
him and looked at Mr Big.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He speaks the truth,’ she said coldly.</p>
