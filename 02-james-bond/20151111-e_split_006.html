<p class="pindent">When Dexter and his colleague had gone, taking the
remains of the bomb with them, Bond took a damp
towel and rubbed the smoke-mark off the wall. Then
he rang for the waiter and, without explanation, told
him to put the broken glass on his check and clear away
the breakfast things. Then he took his hat and coat and
went out on the street.</p>

<p class="pindent">He spent the morning on Fifth Avenue and on
Broadway, wandering aimlessly, gazing into the shop
windows and watching the passing crowds. He gradually
assimilated the casual gait and manners of a visitor from
out of town, and when he tested himself out in a few
shops and asked the way of several people he found
that nobody looked at him twice.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had a typical American meal at an eating house
called ‘Gloryfried Ham-N-Eggs’ (‘The Eggs We Serve
Tomorrow Are Still in the Hens’) on Lexington Avenue
and then took a cab downtown to police headquarters,
where he was due to meet Leiter and Dexter at 2.30.</p>

<p class="pindent">A Lieutenant Binswanger of Homicide, a suspicious
and crusty officer in his late forties, announced that
Commissioner Monahan had said that they were to have
complete co-operation from the Police Department.
What could he do for them? They examined Mr Big’s
police record, which more or less duplicated Dexter’s
information, and they were shown the records and
photographs of most of his known associates.</p>

<p class="pindent">They went over the reports of the US Coastguard
Service on the comings and goings of the yacht <span class="it">Secatur</span>
and also the comments of the US Customs Service,
who had kept a close watch on the boat each time she
had docked at St Petersburg.</p>

<p class="pindent">These confirmed that the yacht had put in at irregular
intervals over the previous six months and that
she always tied up in the Port of St Petersburg at the
wharf of the ‘Ourobouros Worm and Bait Shippers
Inc.’, an apparently innocent concern whose main business
was to sell live bait to fishing clubs throughout
Florida, the Gulf of Mexico and further afield. The
company also had a profitable sideline in sea-shells and
coral for interior decoration, and a further sideline in
tropical aquarium fish—particularly rare poisonous
species for the research departments of medical and
chemical foundations.</p>

<p class="pindent">According to the proprietor, a Greek sponge-fisher
from the neighbouring Tarpon Springs, the <span class="it">Secatur</span> did
big business with his company, bringing in cargoes of
queen conchs and other shells from Jamaica and also
highly prized varieties of tropical fish. These were
purchased by Ourobouros Inc., stored in their warehouse
and sold in bulk to wholesalers and retailers up
and down the coast. The name of the Greek was
Papagos. No criminal record.</p>

<p class="pindent">The FBI, with the help of Naval Intelligence, had
tried listening in to the <span class="it">Secatur’s</span> wireless. But she kept
off the air except for short messages before she sailed
from Cuba or Jamaica and then transmitted <span class="it">en clair</span> in
a language which was unknown and completely indecipherable.
The last notation on the file was to the effect
that the operator was talking in ‘Language’, the secret
Voodoo speech only used by initiates, and that every
effort would be made to hire an expert from Haiti before
the next sailing.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘More gold been turning up lately,’ announced Lieutenant
Binswanger as they walked back to his office
from the Identification Bureau across the street. ‘ ’Bout
a hundred coins a week in Harlem and New York alone.
Want us to do anything about it? If you’re right and
these are Commie funds, they must be pulling it in
pretty fast while we sit on our asses doin’ nothing.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Chief says to lay off,’ said Dexter. ‘Hope we’ll see
some action before long.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, the case is all yours,’ said Binswanger grudgingly.
‘But the Commissioner sure don’t like having this
bastard crappin’ away on his own front doorstep while
Mr Hoover sits down in Washington well to leeward
of the stink. Why don’t we pull him in on tax evasion
or misuse of the mails or parkin’ in front of a hydrant
or sumpn? Take him down to the Tombs and give ’em
the works? If the Feds won’t do it, we’d be glad to
oblige.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘D’you want a race riot?’ objected Dexter sourly.
‘There’s nothing against him and you know it, and we
know it. If he wasn’t sprung in half an hour by that
black mouthpiece of his, those Voodoo drums would
start beating from here to the Deep South. When they’re
full of that stuff we all know what happens. Remember
’35 and ’43? You’d have to call out the Militia. We didn’t
ask for the case. The President gave it to us and we’ve
got to stick with it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They were back in Binswanger’s drab office. They
picked up their coats and hats.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Anyway, thanks for the help, Lootenant,’ said Dexter
with forced cordiality, as they made their farewells. ‘Been
most valuable.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’re welcome,’ said Binswanger stonily. ‘Elevator’s
to your right.’ He closed the door firmly behind
them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter winked at Bond behind Dexter’s back. They
rode down to the main entrance on Center Street in
silence.</p>

<p class="pindent">On the sidewalk, Dexter turned to them.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Had some instructions from Washington this
morning,’ he said unemotionally. ‘Seems I’m to look
after the Harlem end, and you two are to go down to
St Petersburg tomorrow. Leiter’s to find out what he
can there and then move right on to Jamaica with you,
Mr Bond. That is,’ he added, ‘if you’d care to have him
along. It’s your territory.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course,’ said Bond. ‘I was going to ask if he
could come anyway.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Fine,’ said Dexter. ‘Then I’ll tell Washington everything’s
fixed. Anything else I can do for you? All
communications with FBI, Washington, of course. Leiter’s
got the names of our men in Florida, knows the Signals
routine and so forth.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If Leiter’s interested and if you don’t mind,’ said
Bond, ‘I’d like very much to get up to Harlem this
evening and have a look round. Might help to have
some idea of what it looks like in Mr Big’s back
yard.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Dexter reflected.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Okay,’ he said finally. ‘Probably no harm. But don’t
show yourselves too much. And don’t get hurt,’ he
added. ‘There’s no one to help you up there. And don’t
go stirring up a lot of trouble for us. This case isn’t
ripe yet. Until it is, our policy with Mr Big is “live and
let live”.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked quizzically at Captain Dexter.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘In my job,’ he said, ‘when I come up against a man
like this one, I have another motto. It’s “live and let
die”.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Dexter shrugged his shoulders. ‘Maybe,’ he said, ‘but
you’re under my orders here, Mr Bond, and I’d be glad
if you’d accept them.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course,’ said Bond, ‘and thanks for all your help.
Hope you have luck with your end of the job.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Dexter flagged a cab. They shook hands.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘ ’Bye, fellers,’ said Dexter briefly. ‘Stay alive.’ His cab
pulled out into the uptown traffic.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond and Leiter smiled at each other.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Able guy, I should say,’ said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘They’re all that in his show,’ said Leiter. ‘Bit inclined
to be stuffed shirts. Very touchy about their rights.
Always bickering with us or with the police. But I guess
you have much the same problem in England.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh of course,’ said Bond. ‘We’re always rubbing MI5
up the wrong way. And they’re always stepping on the
corns of the Special Branch. Scotland Yard,’ he
explained. ‘Well, how about going up to Harlem
tonight?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Suits me,’ said Leiter. ‘I’ll drop you at the St Regis
and pick you up again about six-thirty. Meet you in the
King Cole Bar, on the ground floor. Guess you want
to take a look at Mr Big,’ he grinned. ‘Well, so do I,
but it wouldn’t have done to tell Dexter so.’ He flagged
a Yellow Cab.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘St Regis Hotel. Fifth at 55th.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They climbed into the overheated tin box reeking of
last week’s cigar-smoke.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter wound down a window.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Whaddya want ter do?’ asked the driver over his
shoulder. ‘Gimme pneumony?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Just that,’ said Leiter, ‘if it means saving us from this
gas chamber.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Wise guy, hn?’ said the driver, crashing tinnily through
his gears. He took the chewed end of a cigar from
behind his ear and held it up. ‘Two bits for three,’ he
said in a hurt voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Twenty-four cents too much,’ said Leiter. The rest
of the drive was passed in silence.</p>

<p class="pindent">They parted at the hotel and Bond went up to his
room. It was four o’clock. He asked the telephone
operator to call him at six. For a while he looked out
of the window of his bedroom. To his left, the sun
was setting in a blaze of colour. In the skyscrapers the
lights were coming on, turning the whole town into a
golden honeycomb. Far below the streets were rivers
of neon lighting, crimson, blue, green. The wind sighed
sadly outside in the velvet dusk, lending his room still
more warmth and security and luxury. He drew the
curtains and turned on the soft lights over his bed.
Then he took off his clothes and climbed between the
fine percale sheets. He thought of the bitter weather in
the London streets, the grudging warmth of the hissing
gas-fire in his office at Headquarters, the chalked-up
menu on the pub he had passed on his last day in
London: ‘Giant Toad &amp; 2 Veg.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He stretched luxuriously. Very soon he was asleep.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">Up in Harlem, at the big switchboard, ‘The Whisper’
was dozing over his racing form. All his lines were quiet.
Suddenly a light shone on the right of the board—an
important light.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, Boss,’ he said softly into his headphone. He
couldn’t have spoken any louder if he had wished to.
He had been born on ‘Lung Block’, on Seventh Avenue,
at 142nd Street, where death from TB is twice as high
as anywhere in New York. Now, he only had part of
one lung left.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Tell all “Eyes”,’ said a slow, deep voice, ‘to watch out
from now on. Three men.’ A brief description of Leiter,
Bond and Dexter followed. ‘May be coming in this
evening or tomorrow. Tell them to watch particularly on
First to Eight and the other Avenues. The night spots
too, in case they’re missed coming in. They’re not to be
molested. Call me when you get a sure fix. Got it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, Sir, Boss,’ said The Whisper, breathing fast. The
voice went quiet. The operator took the whole handful
of plugs, and soon the big switchboard was alive with
winking lights. Softly, urgently, he whispered on into
the evening.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">At six o’clock Bond was awakened by the soft burr of
the telephone. He took a cold shower and dressed carefully.
He put on a garishly striped tie and allowed a
broad wedge of bandana to protrude from his breast
pocket. He slipped the chamois leather holster over his
shirt so that it hung three inches below his left armpit.
He whipped at the mechanism of the Beretta until all
eight bullets lay on the bed. Then he packed them back
into the magazine, loaded the gun, put up the safety-catch
and slipped it into the holster.</p>

<p class="pindent">He picked up the pair of Moccasin casuals, felt their
toes and weighed them in his hand. Then he reached
under the bed and pulled out a pair of his own shoes
he had carefully kept out of the suitcase full of his
belongings the FBI had taken away from him that
morning.</p>

<p class="pindent">He put them on and felt better equipped to face the
evening.</p>

<p class="pindent">Under the leather, the toe-caps were lined with
steel.</p>

<p class="pindent">At six twenty-five he went down to the King Cole
Bar and chose a table near the entrance and against the
wall. A few minutes later Felix Leiter came in. Bond
hardly recognized him. His mop of straw-coloured hair
was now jet black and he wore a dazzling blue suit with
a white shirt and a black-and-white polka-dot tie.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter sat down with a broad grin.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I suddenly decided to take these people seriously,’
he explained. ‘This stuff’s only a rinse. It’ll come off in
the morning. I hope,’ he added.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter ordered medium-dry Martinis with a slice of
lemon peel. He stipulated House of Lords gin and
Martini Rossi. The American gin, a much higher proof
than English gin, tasted harsh to Bond. He reflected
that he would have to be careful what he drank that
evening.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We’ll have to keep on our toes, where we’re going,’
said Felix Leiter, echoing his thoughts. ‘Harlem’s a bit
of a jungle these days. People don’t go up there any
more like they used to. Before the war, at the end of
an evening, one used to go to Harlem just as one goes
to Montmartre in Paris. They were glad to take one’s
money. One used to go to the Savoy Ballroom and
watch the dancing. Perhaps pick up a high-yaller and
risk the doctor’s bills afterwards. Now that’s all changed.
Harlem doesn’t like being stared at any more. Most of
the places have closed and you go to the others strictly
on sufferance. Often you get tossed out on your ear,
simply because you’re white. And you don’t get any
sympathy from the police either.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter extracted the lemon peel from his Martini and
chewed it reflectively. The bar was filling up. It was
warm and companionable—a far cry, Leiter reflected,
from the inimical, electric climate of the negro pleasure-spots
they would be drinking in later.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Fortunately,’ continued Leiter, ‘I like the negroes and
they know it somehow. I used to be a bit of an aficionado
of Harlem. Wrote a few pieces on Dixieland Jazz
for the <span class="it">Amsterdam News</span>, one of the local papers. Did a
series for the North American Newspaper Alliance on
the negro theatre about the time Orson Welles put on
his <span class="it">Macbeth</span> with an all-negro cast at the Lafayette. So I
know my way about up there. And I admire the way
they’re getting on in the world, though God knows I
can’t see the end of it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They finished their drinks and Leiter called for the
check.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course there are some bad ones,’ he said. ‘Some
of the worst anywhere. Harlem’s the capital of the negro
world. In any half a million people of any race you’ll
get plenty of stinkeroos. The trouble with our friend
Mr Big is that he’s the hell of a good technician, thanks
to his OSS and Moscow training. And he must be pretty
well organized up there.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter paid. He shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Let’s go,’ he said. ‘We’ll have ourselves some fun and
try and get back in one piece. After all, this is what we’re
paid for. We’ll take a bus on Fifth Avenue. You won’t
find many cabs that want to go up there after dark.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They walked out of the warm hotel and took the few
steps to the bus stop on the Avenue.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was raining. Bond turned up the collar of his coat
and gazed up the Avenue to his right, towards Central
Park, towards the dark citadel that housed The Big
Man.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s nostrils flared slightly. He longed to get in
there after him. He felt strong and compact and confident.
The evening awaited him, to be opened and read,
page by page, word by word.</p>

<p class="pindent">In front of his eyes, the rain came down in swift,
slanting strokes—italic script across the unopened black
cover that hid the secret hours that lay ahead.</p>
