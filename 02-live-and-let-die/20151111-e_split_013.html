<p class="pindent">The crack train thundered on through the bright afternoon
towards the south. They left Pennsylvania behind,
and Maryland. There came a long halt at Washington,
where Bond heard through his dreams the measured
clang of the warning bells on the shunting engines and
the soft think-speak of the public-address system on the
station. Then on into Virginia. Here the air was already
softer and the dusk, only five hours away from the bright
frosty breath of New York, smelled almost of spring.</p>

<p class="pindent">An occasional group of negroes, walking home from
the fields, would hear the distant rumble on the silent
sighing silver rails and one would pull out his watch
and consult it and announce, ‘Hyah comes da Phantom.
Six o’clock. Guess ma watch is right on time.’ ‘Sho nuff,’
one of the others would say as the great beat of the
Diesels came nearer and the lighted coaches streaked
past and on towards North Carolina.</p>

<p class="pindent">They awoke around seven to the hasty ting of a
grade-crossing alarm bell as the big train nosed its way
out of the fields into the suburbs of Raleigh. Bond
pulled the wedges from under the doors before he
turned on the lights and rang for the attendant.</p>

<p class="pindent">He ordered dry Martinis and when the two little
‘personalized’ bottles appeared with the glasses and the
ice they seemed so inadequate that he at once ordered
four more.</p>

<p class="pindent">They argued over the menu. The fish was described as
being ‘Made From Flaky Tender Boneless Filets’ and the
chicken as ‘Delicious French Fried to a Golden Brown,
Served Disjointed’.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Eyewash,’ said Bond, and they finally ordered scrambled
eggs and bacon and sausages, a salad, and some
of the domestic Camembert that is one of the most
welcome surprises on American menus.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was nine o’clock when Baldwin came to clear the
dishes away. He asked if there was anything else they
wanted.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had been thinking. ‘What time do we get into
Jacksonville?’ he asked.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Aroun’ five ’n the morning, Suh.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Is there a subway on the platform?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yassuh. Dis cyar stops right alongside.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Could you have the door open and the steps down
pretty quick?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The negro smiled. ‘Yassuh. Ah kin take good care of
that.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond slipped him a ten-dollar bill. ‘Just in case I miss
you when we arrive in St Petersburg,’ he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">The negro grinned. ‘Ah greatly preeshiate yo kindness,
Suh. Good night, Suh. Good night, Mam.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He went out and closed the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got up and pushed the wedges firmly under
the two doors.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I see,’ said Solitaire. ‘So it’s like that.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ said Bond. ‘I’m afraid so.’ He told her of the
warning he had had from Baldwin.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m not surprised,’ said the girl when he had finished.
‘They must have seen you coming into the station. He’s
got a whole team of spies called “The Eyes” and when
they’re put out on a job it’s almost impossible to get by
them. I wonder who he’s got on the train. You can be
certain it’s a negro, either a Pullman attendant or
someone in the diner. He can make these people do
absolutely anything he likes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So it seems,’ said Bond. ‘But how does it work?
What’s he got on them?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked out of the window into the tunnel of
darkness through which the lighted train was burning its
thundering path. Then she looked back across the table
into the cool wide grey-blue eyes of the English agent.
She thought: how can one explain to someone with that
certainty of spirit, with that background of common
sense, brought up with clothes and shoes among the
warm houses and the lighted streets? How can one explain
to someone who hasn’t lived close to the secret heart of
the tropics, at the mercy of their anger and stealth and
poison; who hasn’t experienced the mystery of the drums,
seen the quick workings of magic and the mortal dread
it inspires? What can he know of catalepsy, and thought-transference
and the sixth sense of fish, of birds, of
negroes; the deadly meaning of a white chicken’s feather,
a crossed stick in the road, a little leather bag of bones
and herbs? What of Mialism, of shadow-taking, of the
death by swelling and the death by wasting?</p>

<p class="pindent">She shivered and a whole host of dark memories
clustered round her. Above all, she remembered that
first time in the Houmfor where her black nurse had
once taken her as a child. ‘It do yuh no harm, Missy.
Dis powerful good juju. Care fe yuh res ’f yo life.’ And
the disgusting old man and the filthy drink he had given
her. How her nurse had held her jaws open until she
had drunk the last drop and how she had lain awake
screaming every night for a week. And how her nurse
had been worried and then suddenly she had slept all
right until, weeks later, shifting on her pillow, she had
felt something hard and had dug it out from the pillowcase,
a dirty little packet of muck. She had thrown it
out of the window, but in the morning she could not
find it. She had continued to sleep well and she knew
it must have been found by the nurse and secreted
somewhere under the floorboards.</p>

<p class="pindent">Years later, she had found out about the Voodoo
drink—a concoction of rum, gunpowder, grave-dirt
and human blood. She almost retched as the taste came
back to her mouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">What could this man know of these things or of her
half-belief in them?</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked up and found Bond’s eyes fixed quizzically
on her.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’re thinking I shan’t understand,’ he said. ‘And
you’re right up to a point. But I know what fear can
do to people and I know that fear can be caused by
many things. I’ve read most of the books on Voodoo
and I believe that it works. I don’t think it would work
on me because I stopped being afraid of the dark when
I was a child and I’m not a good subject for suggestion
or hypnotism. But I know the jargon and you needn’t
think I shall laugh at it. The scientists and doctors who
wrote the books don’t laugh at it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Solitaire smiled. ‘All right,’ she said. ‘Then all I need
tell you is that they believe The Big Man is the Zombie
of Baron Samedi. Zombies are bad enough by themselves.
They’re animated corpses that have been made
to rise from the dead and obey the commands of the
person who controls them. Baron Samedi is the most
dreadful spirit in the whole of Voodooism. He is the
spirit of darkness and death. So for Baron Samedi to
be in control of his own Zombie is a very dreadful
conception. You know what Mr Big looks like. He is
huge and grey and he has great psychic power. It is not
difficult for a negro to believe that he is a Zombie, and
a very bad one at that. The step to Baron Samedi is
simple. Mr Big encourages the idea by having the Baron’s
fetish at his elbow. You saw it in his room.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She paused. She went on quickly, almost breathlessly:
‘And I can tell you that it works and that there’s hardly
a negro who has seen him and heard the story who
doesn’t believe it and who doesn’t regard him with
complete and absolute dread. And they are right,’ she
added. ‘And you would say so too if you knew the way
he deals with those who haven’t obeyed him completely,
the way they are tortured and killed.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Where does Moscow come in?’ asked Bond. ‘Is it
true he’s an agent of <span class="calibre4">SMERSH</span>?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I don’t know what <span class="calibre4">SMERSH</span> is,’ said the girl, ‘but I
know he works for Russia, at least I’ve heard him talking
Russian to people who come from time to time. Occasionally
he’s had me in to that room and asked me
afterwards what I thought of his visitors. Generally it
seemed to me they were telling the truth although I
couldn’t understand what they said. But don’t forget
I’ve only known him for a year and he’s fantastically
secretive. If Moscow does use him they’ve got hold
of one of the most powerful men in America. He can
find out almost anything he wants to and if he doesn’t
get what he wants somebody gets killed.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Why doesn’t someone kill him?’ asked Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You can’t kill him,’ she said. ‘He’s already dead. He’s
a Zombie.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, I see,’ said Bond slowly. ‘It’s quite an impressive
arrangement. Would you try?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked out of the window, then back at him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘As a last resort,’ she admitted unwillingly. ‘But don’t
forget I come from Haiti. My brain tells me I could kill
him, but . . .’ She made a helpless gesture with her hands.
‘. . . my instinct tells me I couldn’t.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She smiled at him docilely. ‘You must think me a
hopeless fool,’ she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond reflected. ‘Not after reading all those books,’
he admitted. He put his hand across the table and
covered hers with it. ‘When the time comes,’ he said,
smiling, ‘I’ll cut a cross in my bullet. That used to work
in the old days.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked thoughtful. ‘I believe that if anybody can
do it, you can,’ she said. ‘You hit him hard last night in
exchange for what he did to you.’ She took his hand in
hers and pressed it. ‘Now tell me what I must do.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Bed,’ said Bond. He looked at his watch. It was ten
o’clock. ‘Might as well get as much sleep as we can.
We’ll slip off the train at Jacksonville and chance being
spotted. Find another way down to the Coast.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They got up. They stood facing each other in the
swaying train.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly Bond reached out and took her in his right
arm. Her arms went round his neck and they kissed
passionately. He pressed her up against the swaying wall
and held her there. She took his face between her two
hands and held it away, panting. Her eyes were bright
and hot. Then she brought his lips against hers again
and kissed him long and lasciviously, as if she was the
man and he the woman.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond cursed the broken hand that prevented him
exploring her body, taking her. He freed his right hand
and put it between their bodies, feeling her hard breasts,
each with its pointed stigma of desire. He slipped it
down her back until it came to the cleft at the base of
her spine and he let it rest there, holding the centre of
her body hard against him until they had kissed
enough.</p>

<p class="pindent">She took her arms away from round his neck and
pushed him away.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I hoped I would one day kiss a man like that,’ she
said. ‘And when I first saw you, I knew it would be
you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Her arms were down by her sides and her body stood
there, open to him, ready for him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’re very beautiful,’ said Bond. ‘You kiss more
wonderfully than any girl I have ever known.’ He looked
down at the bandages on his left hand. ‘Curse this arm,’
he said. ‘I can’t hold you properly or make love to you.
It hurts too much. That’s something else Mr Big’s got
to pay for.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She laughed.</p>

<p class="pindent">She took a handkerchief out of her bag and wiped
the lipstick off his mouth. Then she brushed the hair
away from his forehead, and kissed him again, lightly
and tenderly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s just as well,’ she said. ‘There are too many other
things on our minds.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The train rocked him back against her.</p>

<p class="pindent">He put his hand on her left breast and kissed her
white throat. Then he kissed her mouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">He felt the pounding of his blood softening. He took
her by the hand and drew her out into the middle of
the little swaying room.</p>

<p class="pindent">He smiled. ‘Perhaps you’re right,’ he said. ‘When the
time comes I want to be alone with you, with all the time
in the world. Here there is at least one man who will
probably disturb our night. And we’ll have to be up at
four in the morning anyway. So there simply isn’t time
to begin making love to you now. You get ready for bed
and I’ll climb up after you and kiss you good night.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They kissed once more, slowly, then he stepped
away.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We’ll just see if we have company next door,’ he
said.</p>

<p class="pindent">He softly pulled the wedge away from under the
communicating door and gently turned the lock. He took
the Beretta out of its holster, thumbed back the safety-catch
and gestured to her to pull open the door so that
she was behind it. He gave the signal and she wrenched
it quickly open. The empty compartment yawned sarcastically
at them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled at her and shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Call me when you’re ready,’ he said and went in and
closed the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">The door to the corridor was locked. The room was
identical to theirs. Bond went over it very carefully for
vulnerable points. There was only the air-conditioning
vent in the ceiling and Bond, who was prepared to
consider any possibility, dismissed the employment of
gas in the system. It would slay all the other occupants
of the car. There only remained the waste pipes in the
small lavatory, and while these certainly could be used
to insert some death-dealing medium from the underbelly
of the train, the operator would have to be a daring
and skilled acrobat. There was no ventilating grille into
the corridor.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shrugged his shoulders. If anyone came, it
would be through the doors. He would just have to stay
awake.</p>

<p class="pindent">Solitaire called for him. The room smelled of Balmain’s
Vent Vert. She was leaning on her elbow and looking
down at him from the upper berth.</p>

<p class="pindent">The bedclothes were pulled up round her shoulder.
Bond guessed that she was naked. Her black hair fell
away from her head in a dark cascade. With only the
reading-lamp on behind her, her face was in shadow.
Bond climbed up the little aluminium ladder and leant
towards her. She reached towards him and suddenly the
bedclothes fell away from her shoulders.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Damn you,’ said Bond. ‘You . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">She put her hand over his mouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘ “Allumeuse” is the nice word for it,’ she said. ‘It is
fun for me to be able to tease such a strong silent man.
You burn with such an angry flame. It is the only game
I have to play with you and I shan’t be able to play it for
long. How many days until your hand is well again?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond bit hard into the soft hand over his mouth. She
gave a little scream.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not many,’ said Bond. ‘And then one day when you’re
playing your little game you’ll suddenly find yourself
pinned down like a butterfly.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She put her arms round him and they kissed, long
and passionately.</p>

<p class="pindent">Finally she sank back among the pillows.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hurry up and get well,’ she said. ‘I’m tired of my game
already.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond climbed down to the floor and pulled her
curtains across the berth.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Try and get some sleep now,’ he said. ‘We’ve got a
long day tomorrow.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She murmured something and he heard her turn over.
She switched off the light.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond verified that the wedges were in place under
the doors. Then he took off his coat and tie and lay
down on the bottom berth. He turned off his own light
and lay thinking of Solitaire and listening to the steady
gallop of the wheels beneath his head and the comfortable
small noises in the room, the gentle rattles and
squeaks and murmurs in the coachwork that bring sleep
so quickly on a train at night-time.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was eleven o’clock and the train was on the long
stretch between Columbia and Savannah, Georgia.
There were another six hours or so to Jacksonville,
another six hours of darkness during which The Big
Man would almost certainly have instructed his agent
to make some move, while the whole train was asleep
and while a man could use the corridors without
interference.</p>

<p class="pindent">The great train snaked on through the dark, pounding
out the miles through the empty plains and mingy
hamlets of Georgia, the ‘Peach State’, the angry moan
of its four-toned wind-horn soughing over the wide
savannah and the long shaft of its single searchlight
ripping the black calico of the night.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned on his light again and read for a while,
but his thoughts were too insistent and he soon gave
up and switched the light off. Instead, he thought of
Solitaire and of the future and of the more immediate
prospects of Jacksonville and St Petersburg and of
seeing Leiter again.</p>

<p class="pindent">Much later, around one o’clock in the morning, he
was dozing and on the edge of sleep, when a soft
metallic noise quite close to his head brought him wide
awake with his hand on his gun.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was someone at the passage door and the lock
was being softly tried.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was immediately on the floor and moving
silently on his bare feet. He gently pulled the wedge
away from under the door to the next compartment
and as gently pulled the bolt and opened the door. He
crossed the next compartment and softly began to open
the door to the corridor.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a deafening click as the bolt came back.
He tore the door open and threw himself into the
corridor, only to see a flying figure already nearing the
forward end of the car.</p>

<p class="pindent">If his two hands had been free he could have shot
the man, but to open the doors he had to tuck his gun
into the waistband of his trousers. Bond knew that
pursuit would be hopeless. There were too many empty
compartments into which the man could dodge and
quietly close the door. Bond had worked all this out
beforehand. He knew his only chance would be surprise
and either a quick shot or the man’s surrender.</p>

<p class="pindent">He walked a few steps to Compartment H. A tiny
diamond of paper protruded into the corridor.</p>

<p class="pindent">He went back and into their room, locking the doors
behind him. He softly turned on his reading light. Solitaire
was still asleep. The rest of the paper, a single
sheet, lay on the carpet against the passage door. He
picked it up and sat on the edge of his bed.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a sheet of cheap ruled notepaper. It was covered
with irregular lines of writing in rough capitals, in red ink.
Bond handled it gingerly, without much hope that it would
yield any prints. These people weren’t like that.</p>
