<p class="pindent">Immediately Bond understood why all these barracuda
and shark were lurking round the island, how they were
kept frenzied with bloodlust by this nightly banquet,
why, against all reason, the three men had been washed
up half-eaten by the fish.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Big had just harnessed the forces of the sea for
his protection. It was a typical invention—imaginative,
technically fool-proof and very easy to operate.</p>

<p class="pindent">Even as Bond’s mind grasped it all, something hit
him a terrific blow in the shoulder and a twenty-pound
barracuda backed away, black rubber and flesh hanging
from its jaws. Bond felt no pain as he let go of the
bronze propeller and threshed wildly for the rocks, only
a horrible sickness in the pit of his stomach at the
thought of part of himself between those hundred
razor-sharp teeth. Water started to ooze between the
close-fitting rubber and his skin. It would not be long
before it penetrated up his neck and into the mask.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was just going to give up and shoot the twenty
feet to the surface when he saw a wide fissure in the
rocks in front of him. Beside it a great boulder lay on
its side and somehow he got behind it. He turned from
the partial shelter it gave just in time to see the same
barracuda coming at him again, its upper jaw held at
right angles to the lower for its infamous gaping
strike.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond fired almost blind with the harpoon gun. The
rubber thongs whammed down the barrel and the
barbed harpoon caught the big fish in the centre of its
raised upper jaw, pierced it and stuck with half the shaft
and the line still free.</p>

<p class="pindent">The barracuda stopped dead in its tracks, three feet
from Bond’s stomach. It tried to get its jaws together
and then gave a mighty shake of its long reptile’s head.
Then it shot away, zigzagging madly, the gun and line,
jerked from Bond’s hand, streaming behind it. Bond
knew that the other fish would be on to it, tearing it to
bits, before it had gone a hundred yards.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond thanked God for the diversion. His shoulder
was now surrounded by a cloud of blood. In a matter
of seconds the other fish would catch the scent. He
slipped round the boulder with the thought that he
would scramble up under the shelter of the jetty and
somehow hide himself above the level of the sea until
he had made a fresh plan.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he saw the cave that the boulder had hidden.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was really almost a door into the base of the island.
If Bond had not been swimming for his life he could
have walked in. As it was, he dived straight through the
opening and only stopped when several yards separated
him from the glimmering entrance.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he stood upright on the soft sand and switched
on his torch. A shark might conceivably come in after
him but in the confined space it would be almost
impossible for it to bring its underslung mouth to bear
on him. It would certainly not come in with a rush for
even the shark is frightened of hazarding its tough skin
among rocks, and he would have plenty of chance of
going for its eyes with his dagger.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shone his torch on the ceiling and sides of the
cave. It had certainly been fashioned or finished by man.
Bond guessed that it had been dug outwards from
somewhere in the centre of the island.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘At least another twenty yards to go, men,’ Bloody
Morgan must have said to the slave overseers. And then
the picks would have burst suddenly through to the sea
and a welter of arms and legs and screaming mouths,
gagged for ever with water, would have hurtled back
into the rock to join the bodies of other witnesses.</p>

<p class="pindent">The great boulder at the entrance would have been
put in position to seal the seaward exit. The Shark Bay
fisherman who suddenly disappeared six months before
must have one day found it rolled away by a storm or
by the tidal wave following a hurricane. Then he had
found the treasure and had known he would need help
to dispose of it. A white man would cheat him. Better
go to the great negro gangster in Harlem and make the
best terms he could. The gold belonged to the black
men who had died to hide it. It should go back to the
black men.</p>

<p class="pindent">Standing there, swaying in the slight current in the
tunnel, Bond guessed that one more barrel of cement
had splashed into the mud of the Harlem River.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was then that he heard the drums.</p>

<p class="pindent">Out amongst the big fish he had heard a soft thunder
in the water that had grown as he entered the cave. But
he had thought it was only the waves against the base
of the island, and anyway he had had other things to
think about.</p>

<p class="pindent">But now he could distinguish a definite rhythm and
the sound boomed and swelled around him in a muffled
roar as if he himself were imprisoned inside a vast
kettle-drum. The water seemed to tremble with it. He
guessed its double purpose. It was a great fish-call used,
when intruders were about, to attract and excite the
fish still further. Quarrel had told him how the fishermen
at night beat the sides of their canoes with the paddle
to wake and bring the fish. This must be the same idea.
And at the same time it would be a sinister Voodoo
warning to the people on shore, made doubly effective
when the dead body was washed up on the following
day.</p>

<p class="pindent">Another of Mr Big’s refinements, thought Bond.
Another spark thrown off by that extraordinary mind.</p>

<p class="pindent">Well, at least he knew where he was now. The drums
meant that he had been spotted. What would Strangways
and Quarrel think as they heard them? They would just
have to sit and sweat it out. Bond had guessed the
drums were some sort of trick and he had made them
promise not to interfere unless the <span class="it">Secatur</span> got safely
away. That would mean that all Bond’s plans had failed.
He had told Strangways where the gold was hidden and
the ship would have to be intercepted on the high
seas.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now the enemy was alerted, but would not know
who he was nor that he was still alive. He would have
to go on if only to stop Solitaire at all costs from sailing
in the doomed ship.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked at his watch. It was half an hour after
midnight. So far as Bond was concerned, it might have
been a week since he started his lonely voyage through
the sea of dangers.</p>

<p class="pindent">He felt the Beretta under his rubber skin and wondered
if it was already ruined by the water that had got in
through the rent made by the barracuda’s teeth.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then, the roar of the drums getting louder every
moment, he moved on into the cave, his torch throwing
a tiny pinpoint of light ahead of him.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had gone about ten yards when a faint glimmer
showed in the water ahead of him. He dowsed the torch
and went cautiously towards it. The sandy floor of the
cave started to move upwards and with every yard the
light grew brighter. Now he could see dozens of small
fish playing around him and ahead the water seemed
full of them, attracted into the cave by the light. Crabs
peered from the small crevices in the rocks and a baby
octopus flattened itself into a phosphorescent star
against the ceiling.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he could make out the end of the cave and a
wide shining pool beyond it, the white sandy bottom
as bright as day. The throb of the drums was very loud.
He stopped in the shadow of the entrance and saw that
the surface was only a few inches away and that lights
were shining down into the pool.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was in a quandary. Any further step and he
would be in full view of anyone looking at the pool. As
he stood, debating with himself, he was horrified to see
a thin red cloud of blood spreading beyond the entrance
from his shoulder. He had forgotten the wound, but
now it began to throb, and when he moved his arm pain
shot through it. There was also the thin stream of
bubbles from the cylinders, but he hoped these were
just creeping up to burst unnoticed at the lip of the
entrance.</p>

<p class="pindent">Even as he drew back a few inches into his hole, his
future was settled for him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Above his head there was a single huge splash and
two negroes, naked except for the glass masks over their
faces, were on to him, long daggers held like lances in
their left hands.</p>

<p class="pindent">Before his hand reached the knife at his belt they had
seized both his arms and were hauling him to the
surface.</p>

<p class="pindent">Hopelessly, helplessly, Bond let himself be manhandled
out of the pool on to flat sand. He was pulled
to his feet and the zips of his rubber suit were torn
open. His helmet was snatched off his head and his
holster from his shoulder and suddenly he was
standing among the debris of his black skin, like a
flayed snake, naked except for his brief swimming-trunks.
Blood oozed down from the jagged hole in
his left shoulder.</p>

<p class="pindent">When his helmet came off Bond was almost deafened
by the shattering boom and stutter of the drums. The
noise was in him and all around him. The hastening
syncopated rhythm galloped and throbbed in his blood.
It seemed enough to wake all Jamaica. Bond grimaced
and clenched his senses against the buffeting tempest
of noise. Then his guards turned him round and he
was faced with a scene so extraordinary that the sound
of the drums receded and all his consciousness was
focused through his eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the foreground, at a green baize card-table, littered
with papers, in a folding chair, sat Mr Big, a pen in his
hand, looking incuriously at him. A Mr Big in a well-cut
fawn tropical suit, with a white shirt and black knitted
silk tie. His broad chin rested on his left hand and he
looked up at Bond as if he had been disturbed in his
office by a member of the staff asking for a raise in
salary. He looked polite but faintly bored.</p>

<p class="pindent">A few steps away from him, sinister and incongruous,
the scarecrow effigy of Baron Samedi, erect on a rock,
gaped at Bond from under its bowler hat.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Big took his hand off his chin, and his great golden
eyes looked Bond over from top to toe.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good morning, Mister James Bond,’ he said at last,
throwing his flat voice against the dying crescendo of
the drums. ‘The fly has indeed been a long time coming
to the spider, or perhaps I should say “the minnow to
the whale”. You left a pretty wake of bubbles after the
reef.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He leant back in his chair and was silent. The drums
softly thudded and boomed.</p>

<p class="pindent">So it was the fight with the octopus that had betrayed
him. Bond’s mind automatically registered the fact as
his eyes moved on past the man at the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was in a rock chamber as big as a church. Half
the floor was taken up with the clear white pool from
which he had come and which verged into aquamarine
and then blue near the black hole of the underwater
entrance. Then there was the narrow strip of sand on
which he was standing, and the rest of the floor was
smooth flat rock dotted with a few grey and white
stalagmites.</p>

<p class="pindent">Some way behind Mr Big, steep steps mounted
towards a vaulted ceiling from which short limestone
stalactites hung down. From their white nipples water
dripped intermittently into the pool or on to the points
of the young stalagmites that rose towards them from
the floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">A dozen bright arc lights were fixed high up on the
walls and reflected golden highlights from the naked
chests of a group of negroes standing to his left on
the stone floor rolling their eyes and watching Bond,
their teeth showing in delighted cruel grins.</p>

<p class="pindent">Round their black and pink feet, in a debris of broken
timber and rusty iron hoops, mildewed strips of leather
and disintegrating canvas, was a blazing sea of gold
coin—yards, piles, cascades of round golden specie
from which the black legs rose as if they had been
halted in the middle of a walk through flame.</p>

<p class="pindent">Beside them were piled row upon row of shallow
wooden trays. There were some on the floor partly filled
with gold coin, and at the bottom of the steps a single
negro had stopped on his way up and he was holding
one of the trays in his hands and it was full of gold
coin, four cylindrical rows of it, held out as if for sale
between his hands.</p>

<p class="pindent">Further to the left, in a corner of the chamber, two
negroes stood by a bellying iron cauldron suspended
over three hissing blow-lamps, its base glowing red.
They held iron skimmers in their hands and these were
splashed with gold half way up the long handles. Beside
them was a towering jumble of gold objects, plate, altar
pieces, drinking vessels, crosses, and a stack of gold
ingots of various sizes. Along the wall near them were
ranged rows of metal cooling trays, their segmented
surfaces gleaming yellow, and there was an empty tray
on the floor near the cauldron and a long gold-spattered
ladle, its handle bound with cloth.</p>

<p class="pindent">Squatting on the floor not far from Mr Big, a single
negro had a knife in one hand and a jewelled goblet in
the other. Beside him on a tin plate was a pile of gems
that winked dully, red and blue and green, in the glare
of the arcs.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was warm and airless in the great rock chamber
and yet Bond shivered as his eyes took in the whole
splendid scene, the blazing violet-white lights, the shimmering
bronze of the sweating bodies, the bright glare
of the gold, the rainbow pool of jewels and the milk
and aquamarine of the pool. He shivered at the beauty
of it all, at this fabulous petrified ballet in the great
treasure-house of Bloody Morgan.</p>

<p class="pindent">His eyes came back to the square of green baize and
the great zombie face and he looked at the face and
into the wide yellow eyes with awe, almost with reverence.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Stop the drums,’ said The Big Man to no one in
particular. They had died almost to a whisper, a lisping
beat right on the pulse of the blood. One of the negroes
took two softly clanging steps amongst the gold coin
and bent down. There was a portable phonograph on
the floor and a powerful amplifier leant beside it against
the rock wall. There was a click and the drums stopped.
The negro shut the lid of the machine and went back
to his place.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Get on with the work,’ said Mr Big, and at once all
the figures started moving as if a penny had been put
in a slot. The cauldron was stirred, the gold was picked
up and clicked into the boxes, the man picked busily at
his jewelled goblet and the negro with the tray of gold
moved on up the stairs.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stood and dripped sweat and blood.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Big Man bent over the lists on his table and
wrote one or two figures with his pen.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stirred and felt the prick of a dagger over his
kidneys.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Big Man put down his pen and got slowly to his
feet. He moved away from the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Take over,’ he said to one of Bond’s guards and the
naked man walked round the table and sat down in Mr
Big’s chair and picked up the pen.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Bring him up.’ Mr Big walked over to the steps in
the rock and started to climb them slowly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond felt a prick in his side. He stepped out of the
debris of his black skin and followed the slowly climbing
figure.</p>

<p class="pindent">No one looked up from his work. No one would slacken
when Mr Big was out of sight. No one would put a jewel
or a coin in his mouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">Baron Samedi was left in charge.</p>

<p class="pindent">Only his Zombie had gone from the cave.</p>
