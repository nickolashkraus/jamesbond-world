<p class="pindent">At twelve forty-five Bond and Leiter paid off their cab
and walked in under the sign which announced ‘The
Boneyard’ in violet and green neon.</p>

<p class="pindent">The thudding rhythm and the sour-sweet smell rocked
them as they pushed through the heavy curtains inside
the swing door. The eyes of the hat-check girls glowed
and beckoned.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Have you reserved, Sir?’ asked the head waiter.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No,’ said Leiter. ‘We don’t mind sitting at the bar.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The head waiter consulted his table-plan. He seemed
to decide. He put his pencil firmly through a space at
the end of the card.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Party hasn’t shown. Guess Ah cain’t hold their
res’vation all night. This way, please.’ He held his card
high over his head and led them round the small
crowded dance-floor. He pulled out one of the two
chairs and removed the <span class="calibre4">RESERVED</span> sign.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sam,’ he called a waiter over. ‘Look after these
gemmums order.’ He moved away.</p>

<p class="pindent">They ordered scotch-and-soda and chicken sandwiches.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sniffed. ‘Marihuana,’ he commented.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Most of the real hep-cats smoke reefers,’ explained
Leiter. ‘Wouldn’t be allowed most places.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked round. The music had stopped. The
small four-piece band, clarinet, double-bass, electric
guitar and drums, was moving out of the corner opposite.
The dozen or so couples were walking and jiving
to their tables and the crimson light was turned off
under the glass dance-floor. Instead, pencil-thin lights
in the roof came on and hit coloured glass witchballs,
larger than footballs, that hung at intervals round the
wall. They were of different hues, golden, blue, green,
violet, red. As the beams of light hit them, they glowed
like coloured suns. The walls, varnished black, mirrored
their reflections as did the sweat on the ebony faces of
the men. Sometimes a man sitting between two lights
showed cheeks of different colour, green on one side,
perhaps, and red on the other. The lighting made it
impossible to distinguish features unless they were only
a few feet away. Some of the lights turned the girls’
lipstick black, others lit their whole faces in a warm
glow on one side and gave the other profile the luminosity
of a drowned corpse.</p>

<p class="pindent">The whole scene was macabre and livid, as if El
Greco had done a painting by moonlight of an exhumed
graveyard in a burning town.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was not a large room, perhaps sixty foot square.
There were about fifty tables and the customers were
packed in like black olives in a jar. It was hot and the air
was thick with smoke and the sweet, feral smell of two
hundred negro bodies. The noise was terrific—an undertone
of the jabber of negroes enjoying themselves
without restraint, punctuated by sharp bursts of noise,
shouts and high giggles, as loud voices called to each
other across the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sweet Jeessus, look who’s hyar . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Where you been keepin’ yoself, baby . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Gawd’s troof. It’s Pinkus . . . Hi Pinkus . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Cmon over . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Lemme be . . . Lemme be, I’se telling ya . . .’ (The
noise of a slap.)</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Where’s G-G? Cmon G-G. Strut yo stuff . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">From time to time a man or girl would erupt on to
the dance-floor and start a wild solo jive. Friends would
clap the rhythm. There would be a burst of catcalls and
whistles. If it was a girl, there would be cries of ‘Strip,
strip, strip,’ ‘Get hot, baby!’ ‘Shake it, shake it,’ and the
MC would come out and clear the floor amidst groans
and shouts of derision.</p>

<p class="pindent">The sweat began to bead on Bond’s forehead. Leiter
leant over and cupped his hands. ‘Three exits. Front.
Service behind us. Behind the band.’ Bond nodded. At
that moment he felt it didn’t matter. This was nothing
new to Leiter, but for Bond it was a close-up of the
raw material on which The Big Man worked, the clay
in his hands. The evening was gradually putting flesh
on the dossiers he had read in London and New York.
If the evening ended now, without any closer sight of
Mr Big himself, Bond still felt his education in the case
would be almost complete. He took a deep draught of
his whisky. There was a burst of applause. The MC
had come out on to the dance-floor, a tall negro in
immaculate tails with a red carnation in his button hole.
He stood, holding up his hands. A single white spotlight
caught him. The rest of the room went dark.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was silence.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Folks,’ announced the MC with a broad flash of
gold and white teeth. ‘This is it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">There was excited clapping.</p>

<p class="pindent">He turned to the left of the floor, directly across
from Leiter and Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">He flung out his right hand. Another spot came
on.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mistah Jungles Japhet ’n his drums.’</p>

<p class="pindent">A crash of applause, catcalls, whistles.</p>

<p class="pindent">Four grinning negroes in flame-coloured shirts and
peg-top white trousers were revealed, squatting astride
four tapering barrels with rawhide membranes. The
drums were of different sizes. The negroes were all
gaunt and stringy. The one sitting astride the bass drum
rose briefly and shook clasped hands at the spectators.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Voodoo drummers from Haiti,’ whispered Leiter.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was silence. With the tips of their fingers the
drummers began a slow, broken beat, a soft rumba
shuffle.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And now, friends,’ announced the MC, still turned
towards the drums, ‘G-G . . .’ he paused, ‘SUMATRA.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The last word was a yell. He began to clap. There
was pandemonium in the room, a frenzy of applause.
The door behind the drums burst open and two huge
negroes, naked except for gold loincloths, ran out on
to the floor carrying between them, her arms round
their necks, a tiny figure, swathed completely in black
ostrich feathers, a black domino across her eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">They put her down in the middle of the floor. They
bowed down on either side of her until their foreheads
met the ground. She took two paces forward. With the
spotlight off them, the two negroes melted away into
the shadows and through the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">The MC had disappeared. There was absolute silence
save for the soft thud of the drums.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl put her hand up to her throat and the cloak
of black feathers came away from the front of her body
and spread out into a five-foot black fan. She swirled
it slowly behind her until it stood up like a peacock’s
tail. She was naked except for a brief vee of black lace
and a black sequined star in the centre of each breast
and the thin black domino across her eyes. Her body
was small, hard, bronze, beautiful. It was slightly oiled
and glinted in the white light.</p>

<p class="pindent">The audience was silent. The drums began to step
up the tempo. The bass drum kept its beat dead on the
timing of the human pulse.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl’s naked stomach started slowly to revolve in
time with the rhythm. She swept the black feathers
across and behind her again, and her hips started to
grind in time with the bass drum. The upper part of
her body was motionless. The black feathers swirled
again, and now her feet were shifting, and her shoulders.
The drums beat louder. Each part of her body seemed
to be keeping a different time. Her lips were bared
slightly from her teeth. Her nostrils began to flare. Her
eyes glinted hotly through the diamond slits. It was a
sexy, pug-like face—<span class="it">chienne</span> was the only word Bond
could think of.</p>

<p class="pindent">The drums thudded faster, a complexity of interlaced
rhythms. The girl tossed the big fan off the floor, held
her arms up above her head. Her whole body began to
shiver. Her belly moved faster. Round and round, in
and out. Her legs straddled. Her hips began to revolve
in a wide circle. Suddenly she plucked the sequined star
off her right breast and threw it into the audience. The
first noise came from the spectators, a quiet growl. Then
they were silent again. She plucked off the other star.
Again the growl and then silence. The drums began to
crash and roll. Sweat poured off the drummers. Their
hands fluttered like grey flannel on the pale membranes.
Their eyes were bulging, distant. Their heads were
slightly bent to one side as if they were listening. They
hardly glanced at the girl. The audience panted softly,
liquid eyes bulging and rolling.</p>

<p class="pindent">The sweat was shining all over her now. Her breasts
and stomach glistened with it. She broke into great shuddering
jerks. Her mouth opened and she screamed softly.
Her hands snaked down to her sides and suddenly she
had torn away the strip of lace. She threw it into the
audience. There was nothing now but a single black
G-string. The drums went into a hurricane of sexual
rhythm. She screamed softly again and then, her arms
stretched before her as a balance, she started to lower
her body down to the floor and up again. Faster and
faster. Bond could hear the audience panting and grunting
like pigs at the trough. He felt his own hands gripping
the tablecloth. His mouth was dry.</p>

<p class="pindent">The audience began to shout at her. ‘Cmon, G-G.
Take it away, Baby. Cmon. Grind, Baby, grind.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She sank to her knees and as the rhythm slowly died
so she too went into a last series of juddering spasms,
mewing softly.</p>

<p class="pindent">The drums came down to a slow tom-tom beat and
shuffle. The audience howled for her body. Harsh
obscenities came from different corners of the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">The MC came on to the floor. A spot went on
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Okay, folks, okay.’ The sweat was pouring off his
chin. He spread his arms in surrender.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Da G-G AGREES!’</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a delighted howl from the audience. Now
she would be quite naked. ‘Take it off, G-G. Show yoself,
Baby. Cmon, cmon.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The drums growled and stuttered softly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But, mah friends,’ yelled the MC, ‘she stipperlates—with
da lights OUT!’</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a frustrated groan from the audience. The
whole room was plunged in darkness.</p>

<p class="pindent">Must be an old gag, thought Bond to himself.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly all his senses were alert.</p>

<p class="pindent">The howling of the mob was disappearing, rapidly.
At the same time he felt cold air on his face. He felt
as if he was sinking.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hey!’ shouted Leiter. His voice was close but it
sounded hollow.</p>

<p class="pindent">Christ! thought Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">Something snapped shut above his head. He put his
hand out behind him. It touched a moving wall a foot
from his back.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Lights,’ said a voice, quietly.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the same time both his arms were gripped. He
was pressed down in his chair.</p>

<p class="pindent">Opposite him, still at the table, sat Leiter, a huge
negro grasping his elbows. They were in a tiny square
cell. To right and left were two more negroes in plain
clothes with guns trained on them.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was the sharp hiss of a hydraulic garage lift
and the table settled quietly to the floor. Bond glanced
up. There was the faint join of a broad trap-door a few
feet above their heads. No sound came through it.</p>

<p class="pindent">One of the negroes grinned.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Take it easy, folks. Enjoy da ride?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter let out one single harsh obscenity. Bond relaxed
his muscles, waiting.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Which is da Limey?’ asked the negro who had spoken.
He seemed to be in charge. The pistol he held trained
lazily on Bond’s heart was very fancy. There was a glint
of mother-of-pearl between his black fingers on the
stock and the long octagonal barrel was finely chased.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Dis one, Ah guess,’ said the negro who was holding
Bond’s arm. ‘He got da scar.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The negro’s grip on Bond’s arm was terrific. It was
as if he had two fierce tourniquets applied above the
elbows. His hands were beginning to go numb.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man with the fancy gun came round the corner
of the table. He shoved the muzzle of his gun into
Bond’s stomach. The hammer was back.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You oughtn’t to miss at that range,’ said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Shaddap,’ said the negro. He frisked Bond expertly
with his left hand—legs, thighs, back, sides. He dug
out Bond’s gun and handed it to the other armed
man.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Give dat to da Boss, Tee-Hee,’ he said. ‘Take da
Limey up. Yuh go ’long wid em. Da other guy stays
wid me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yassuh,’ said the man called Tee-Hee, a paunchy
negro in a chocolate shirt and lavender-coloured peg-top
trousers.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was hauled to his feet. He had one foot hooked
under a leg of the table. He yanked hard. There was a
crash of glass and silverware. At the same moment,
Leiter kicked out backwards round the leg of his chair.
There was a satisfactory ‘klonk’ as his heel caught his
guard’s shin. Bond did the same but missed. There was
a moment of chaos, but neither of the guards slackened
his grip. Leiter’s guard picked him bodily out of the
chair as if he had been a child, faced him to the wall
and slammed him into it. It nearly smashed Leiter’s
nose. The guard swung him round. Blood was streaming
down over his mouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">The two guns were still trained unwaveringly on them.
It had been a futile effort, but for a split second they
had regained the initiative and effaced the sudden shock
of capture.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’ waste yo breff,’ said the negro who had been
giving the orders. ‘Take da Limey away.’ He addressed
Bond’s guard. ‘Mr Big’s waiten’.’ He turned to Leiter.
‘Yo kin tell yo fren’ goodbye,’ he said. ‘Yo is unlikely
be seein’ yoselves agin.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled at Leiter. ‘Lucky we made a date for the
police to meet us here at two,’ he said. ‘See you at the
line-up.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter grinned back. His teeth were red with blood.
‘Commissioner Monahan’s going to be pleased with this
bunch. Be seeing you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Crap,’ said the negro with conviction. ‘Get goin’.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s guard whipped him round and shoved him
against a section of the wall. It opened on a pivot into
a long bare passage. The man called Tee-Hee pushed
past them and led the way.</p>

<p class="pindent">The door swung to behind them.</p>
