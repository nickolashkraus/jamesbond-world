<p class="pindent">The girl had not put up much of a struggle.</p>

<p class="pindent">When Leiter and Bond, leaving the manageress gaping
on the lawn, raced down to the end cottage, they found
her room untouched and the bedclothes barely
rumpled.</p>

<p class="pindent">The lock of her room had been forced with one swift
wrench of a jemmy and then the two men must have
just stood there with guns in their hands.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Get going, Lady. Get your clothes on. Try any tricks
and we’ll let the fresh air into you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Then they must have gagged her or knocked her out
and doubled her into the packing-case and nailed it up.
There were tyre-marks at the back of the cottage where
the truck had stood. Almost blocking the entrance hall
was a huge old-fashioned radiogram. Second-hand it
must have cost them under fifty bucks.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond could see the expression of blind terror on
Solitaire’s face as if she were standing before him. He
cursed himself bitterly for leaving her alone. He couldn’t
guess how she had been traced so quickly. It was just
another example of The Big Man’s machine.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter was talking to the FBI headquarters at Tampa.
‘Airports, railroad terminals and the highways,’ he was
saying. ‘You’ll get blanket orders from Washington just
as soon as I’ve spoken to them. I guarantee they’ll give
this top priority. Thanks a lot. Much appreciated. I’ll be
around. Okay.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He hung up. ‘Thank God they’re co-operating,’ he
said to Bond, who was standing gazing with hard blank
eyes out to sea. ‘Sending a couple of their men round
right away and throwing as wide a net as they can. While
I sew this up with Washington and New York, get what
you can from that old battle-axe. Exact time, descriptions,
etc. Better make out it was a burglary and that
Solitaire has skipped with the men. She’ll understand
that. It’ll keep the whole thing on the level of the usual
hotel crimes. Say the police are on the way and that we
don’t blame The Everglades. She’ll want to avoid a
scandal. Say we feel the same way.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond nodded. ‘Skipped with the men?’ That was
possible too. But somehow he didn’t think so. He went
back to Solitaire’s room and searched it minutely. It still
smelled of her, of the Vent Vert that reminded him of
their journey together. Her hat and veil were in the
cupboard and her few toilet articles on the shelf in
the bathroom. He soon found her bag and knew that he
was right to have trusted her. It was under the bed, and
he visualized her kicking it there as she got up with the
guns trained on her. He emptied it out on the bed and
felt the lining. Then he took out a small knife and carefully
cut a few threads. He took out the five thousand
dollars and slipped them into his pocket-book. They
would be safe with him. If she was killed by Mr Big,
he would spend them on avenging her. He covered up
the torn lining as best he could, replaced the other
contents of the bag and kicked it back under the bed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he went up to the office.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was eight o’clock by the time the routine work was
finished. They had a stiff drink together and then went
to the central dining-room, where the handful of other
guests were just finishing their dinners. Everyone looked
curiously and rather fearfully at them. What were these
two rather dangerous-looking young men doing in this
place? Where was the woman who had come with them?
Whose wife was she? What had all those goings on
meant that evening? Poor Mrs Stuyvesant running about
looking quite distracted. And didn’t they realize that
dinner was at seven o’clock? The kitchen staff would
be just going home. Serve them right if their food was
quite cold. People must have consideration for others.
Mrs Stuyvesant had said she thought they were government
men, from Washington. Well, what did that
mean?</p>

<p class="pindent">The consensus of opinion was that they were bad
news and no credit to the carefully restricted clientele
of The Everglades.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond and Leiter were shown to a bad table near the
service door. The set dinner was a string of inflated
English and pidgin French. What it came down to was
tomato juice, boiled fish with a white sauce, a strip of
frozen turkey with a dab of cranberry, and a wedge of
lemon curd surmounted by a whorl of stiff cream substitute.
They munched it down gloomily while the dining-room
emptied of its oldster couples and the table lights went
out one by one. Fingerbowls, in which floated one hibiscus
petal, were the final gracious touch to their meal.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond ate silently and when they had finished Leiter
made a determined effort to be cheerful.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Come and get drunk,’ he said. ‘This is the bad end
to a worse day. Or do you want to play bingo with the
oldsters? It says there’s a bingo tournament in the “romp
room” this evening.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shrugged his shoulders and they went back to
their sitting-room and sat gloomily for a while, drinking
and staring out across the sand, bone-white in the light
of the moon, towards the endless dark sea.</p>

<p class="pindent">When Bond had drunk enough to drown his thoughts
he said good night and went off to Solitaire’s room,
which he had now taken over as his bedroom. He
climbed between the sheets where her warm body had
lain and, before he slept, he had made up his mind. He
would go after The Robber as soon as it was light and
strangle the truth out of him. He had been too
preoccupied to discuss the case with Leiter but he was
certain that The Robber must have had a big hand in
the kidnapping of Solitaire. He thought of the man’s
little cruel eyes and the pale thin lips. Then he thought
of the scrawny neck rising like a turtle’s out of the dirty
sweat-shirt. Under the bedclothes the muscles of his
arms went taut. Then, his mind made up, he relaxed
his body into sleep.</p>

<p class="pindent">He slept until eight. When he saw the time on his
watch he cursed. He quickly took a shower, holding his
eyes open into the needles of water until they smarted.
Then he put a towel round his waist and went into
Leiter’s room. The slats of the jalousies were still down
but there was light enough to see that neither bed had
been slept in.</p>

<p class="pindent">He smiled, thinking that Leiter had probably finished
the bottle of whisky and fallen asleep on the couch in
the living-room. He walked through. The room was
empty. The bottle of whisky, still half full, was on the
table, and a pile of cigarette butts overflowed the ash-tray.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond went to the window, pulled up the jalousies
and opened it. He caught a glimpse of a beautiful clear
morning before he turned back into the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he saw the envelope. It was on a chair in front
of the door through which he had come. He picked it
up. It contained a note scribbled in pencil.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="pindent1">Got to thinking and don’t feel like sleep. It’s about five
a.m. Going to visit the worm-and-bait store. All same
early bird. Odd that trick-shot artist was sitting there
while S. was being snatched. As if he knew we were in
town and was ready for trouble in case the snatch went
wrong. If I’m not back by ten, call out the militia.
Tampa 88.</p>

<p class="line6"><span class="calibre4">FELIX</span></p>

</div>

<p class="pindent">Bond didn’t wait. While he shaved and dressed he
ordered some coffee and rolls and a cab. In just over ten
minutes he had got them all and had scalded himself with
the coffee. He was leaving the cottage when he heard the
telephone ring in the living-room. He ran back.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mr Bryce? Mound Park Hospital speaking,’ said a
voice. ‘Emergency ward. Doctor Roberts. We have a
Mr Leiter here who’s asking for you. Can you come
right over?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘God Almighty,’ said Bond, gripped with fear. ‘What’s
the matter with him? Is he bad?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nothing to worry about,’ said the voice. ‘Automobile
accident. Looks like a hit-and-run job. Slight concussion.
Can you come over? He seems to want you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course,’ said Bond, relieved. ‘Be there right
away.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Now what the hell, he wondered as he hurried across
the lawn. Must have been beaten up and left in the
road. On the whole, Bond was glad it was no worse.</p>

<p class="pindent">As they turned across Treasure Island Causeway an
ambulance passed them, its bell clanging.</p>

<p class="pindent">More trouble, thought Bond. Don’t seem to be able
to move without running into it.</p>

<p class="pindent">They crossed St Petersburg by Central Avenue and
turned right down the road he and Leiter had taken the
day before. Bond’s suspicions seemed to be confirmed
when he found the hospital was only a couple of blocks
from Ourobouros Inc.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond paid off the cab and ran up the steps of the
impressive building. There was a reception desk in the
spacious entrance hall. A pretty nurse sat at the desk
reading the ads in the <span class="it">St Petersburg Times</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Dr Roberts?’ inquired Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Dr which?’ asked the girl, looking at him with
approval.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Dr Roberts, Emergency ward,’ said Bond impatiently,
‘Patient called Leiter, Felix Leiter. Brought in this
morning’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No doctor called Roberts here,’ said the girl. She ran
a finger down a list on the desk. ‘And no patient called
Leiter. Just a moment and I’ll call the ward. What did
you say your name was?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Bryce,’ said Bond. ‘John Bryce.’ He started to sweat
profusely although it was quite cool in the hall. He
wiped his wet hands on his trousers, fighting to keep
from panic. The damn girl just didn’t know her job.
Too pretty to be a nurse. Ought to have someone
competent on the desk. He ground his teeth as she
talked cheerfully into the telephone.</p>

<p class="pindent">She put down the receiver. ‘I’m sorry, Mr Bryce. Must
be some mistake. No cases during the night and they’ve
never heard of a Dr Roberts or a Mr Leiter. Sure you’ve
got the right hospital?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned away without answering her. Wiping the
sweat from his forehead, he made for the exit.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl made a face at his back and picked up her
paper.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mercifully, a cab was just drawing up with some other
visitors. Bond took it and told the driver to get him
back quick to The Everglades. All he knew was that
they had got Leiter and had wanted to draw Bond away
from the cottage. Bond couldn’t make it out, but he
knew that suddenly everything was going bad on them
and that the initiative was back in the hands of Mr Big
and his machine.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mrs Stuyvesant hurried out when she saw him leave
the cab.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Your poor friend,’ she said without sympathy. ‘Really
he should be more careful.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, Mrs Stuyvesant. What is it?’ said Bond impatiently.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The ambulance came just after you left.’ The woman’s
eyes were gleaming with the bad news. ‘Seems Mr Leiter
was in an accident with his car. They had to carry him
to the cottage on a stretcher. Such a nice coloured man
was in charge. He said Mr Leiter would be quite all right
but he mustn’t be disturbed on any account. Poor boy!
Face all covered with bandages. They said they’d make
him comfortable and a doctor would be coming later.
If there’s anything I can . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond didn’t wait for more. He ran down the lawn to
the cottage and dashed through the lobby into Leiter’s
room.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was the shape of a body on Leiter’s bed. It
was covered with a sheet. Over the face, the sheet
seemed to be motionless.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gritted his teeth as he leant over the bed. Was
there a tiny flutter of movement?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond snatched the shroud down from the face. There
was no face. Just something wrapped round and round
with dirty bandages, like a white wasps’ nest.</p>

<p class="pindent">He softly pulled the sheet down further. More bandages,
still more roughly wound, with wet blood seeping
through. Then the top of a sack which covered the lower
half of the body. Everything soaked in blood.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a piece of paper protruding from a gap
in the bandages where the mouth should have been.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond pulled it away and leant down. There was the
faintest whisper of breath against his cheek. He snatched
up the bedside telephone. It took minutes before he could
make Tampa understand. Then the urgency in his voice
got through. They would get to him in twenty minutes.</p>

<p class="pindent">He put down the receiver and looked vaguely at the
paper in his hand. It was a rough piece of white wrapping
paper. Scrawled in pencil in ragged block letters
were the words:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="pindent1">HE DISAGREED WITH SOMETHING THAT
ATE HIM</p>

</div>

<p class="pindent">And underneath in brackets:</p>

<div class="lgc"> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class="line7">(P.S. WE HAVE PLENTY MORE JOKES</p>
<p class="line7">AS GOOD AS THIS)</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class="pindent">With the movements of a sleep-walker, Bond put the
piece of paper down on the bedside table. Then he turned
back to the body on the bed. He hardly dared touch it
for fear that the tiny fluttering breath would suddenly
cease. But he had to find out something. His fingers
worked softly at the bandages on top of the head. Soon
he uncovered some of the strands of hair. The hair was
wet and he put his fingers to his mouth. There was a
salt taste. He pulled out some strands of hair and looked
closely at them. There was no more doubt.</p>

<p class="pindent">He saw again the pale straw-coloured mop that used
to hang down in disarray over the right eye, grey and
humorous, and below it the wry, hawk-like face of the
Texan with whom he had shared so many adventures.
He thought of him for a moment, as he had been. Then
he tucked the lock of hair back into the bandages and
sat on the edge of the other bed and quietly watched
over the body of his friend and wondered how much
of it could be saved.</p>

<p class="pindent">When the two detectives and the police surgeon arrived
he told them all he knew in a quiet flat voice. Acting on
what Bond had already told them on the telephone they
had sent a squad car down to The Robber’s place and
they waited for a report while the surgeon worked next
door.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was finished first. He came back into the sitting-room
looking anxious. Bond jumped to his feet. The
police surgeon slumped into a chair and looked up at
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I think he’ll live,’ he said. ‘But it’s fifty-fifty. They
certainly did a job on the poor guy. One arm gone.
Half the left leg. Face in a mess, but only superficial.
Darned if I know what did it. Only thing I can think
of is an animal or a big fish. Something’s been tearing
at him. Know a bit more when I can get him to the
hospital. There’ll be traces left from the teeth of whatever
it was. Ambulance should be along any time.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They sat in gloomy silence. The telephone rang intermittently.
New York, Washington. The St Petersburg
Police Department wanted to know what the hell was
going on down at the wharf and were told to keep out
of the case. It was a Federal job. Finally, from a call-box,
there was the lieutenant in charge of the squad
car reporting.</p>

<p class="pindent">They had been over The Robber’s place with a fine
tooth-comb. Nothing but tanks of fish and bait and
cases of coral and shells. The Robber and two men
who were down there in charge of the pumps and the
water-heating had been taken in custody and grilled for
an hour. Their alibis had been checked and found to
be solid as the Empire State. The Robber had angrily
demanded his mouthpiece and when the lawyer had
finally been allowed to get to them they had been automatically
sprung. No charge and no evidence to base
one on. Dead-ends everywhere except that Leiter’s car
had been found the other side of the yacht basin, a
mile away from the wharf. A mass of fingerprints, but
none that fitted the three men. Any suggestions?</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Keep with it,’ said the senior man in the cottage who
had introduced himself as Captain Franks. ‘Be along
presently. Washington says we’ve got to get these men
if it’s the last thing we do. Two top operatives flying
down tonight. Time to get co-operation from the Police.
I’ll tell ’em to get their stoolies working in Tampa. This
isn’t only a St Petersburg job. Bye now.’</p>

<p class="pindent">It was three o’clock. The police ambulance came and
left again with the surgeon and the body that was so
near to death. The two men left. They promised to keep
in touch. They were anxious to know Bond’s plans.
Bond was evasive. Said he’d have to talk to Washington.
Meanwhile, could he have Leiter’s car? Yes, it would be
brought round directly Records had finished with it.</p>

<p class="pindent">When they had gone, Bond sat lost in thought. They
had made sandwiches from the well-stocked pantry and
Bond now finished these and had a stiff drink.</p>

<p class="pindent">The telephone rang. Long Distance. Bond found
himself speaking to the head of Leiter’s Section of the
Central Intelligence Agency. The gist of it was that
they’d be very glad if Bond would move on to Jamaica
at once. All very polite. They had spoken to London,
who had agreed. When should they tell London that
Bond would arrive in Jamaica?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond knew there was a Transcarib plane via Nassau
due out next day. He said he’d be taking it. Any other
news? Oh yes, said the CIA. The gentleman from
Harlem and his girl friend had left by plane for Havana,
Cuba, during the night. Private charter from a little place
up the East Coast called Vero Beach. Papers were in
order and charter company was such a small one the
FBI had not bothered to include them when they put
the watch on all airports. Arrival had been reported by
the CIA man in Cuba. Yes, too bad. Yes, the <span class="it">Secatur</span>
was still there. No sailing date. Well, too bad about
Leiter. Fine man. Hope he makes out. So Bond would
be in Jamaica tomorrow? Okay. Sorry things been so
hectic. ’Bye.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond thought for a while, then he picked up the
telephone and spoke briefly to a man at the Eastern
Garden Aquarium at Miami and consulted him about
buying a live shark to keep in an ornamental lagoon.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Only place I ever heard of is right near you now, Mr
Bryce,’ said the helpful voice. ‘Ourobouros Worm and
Bait. They got sharks. Big ones. Do business with
foreign zoos and suchlike. White, Tiger, even Hammerheads.
They’ll be glad to help you. Costs a lot to feed
’em. You’re welcome. Any time you’re passing. ’Bye.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took out his gun and cleaned it, waiting for the
night.</p>
