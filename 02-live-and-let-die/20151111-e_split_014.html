<p class="pindent">It was around five o’clock in the morning when they
slipped off the train at Jacksonville.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was still dark and the naked platforms of the great
Florida junction were sparsely lit. The entrance to the
subway was only a few yards from Car 245 and there
was no sign of life on the sleeping train as they dived
down the steps. Bond had told the attendant to keep
the door of their compartment locked after they had
gone and the blinds drawn and he thought there was
quite a chance they would not be missed until the train
reached St Petersburg.</p>

<p class="pindent">They came out of the subway into the booking-hall.
Bond verified that the next express for St Petersburg
would be the Silver Meteor, the sister train of the
Phantom, due at about nine o’clock, and he booked
two Pullman seats on it. Then he took Solitaire’s arm
and they walked out of the station into the warm dark
street.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were two or three all-night diners to choose
from and they pushed through the door that announced
<span class="calibre4">GOOD EATS</span> in the brightest neon. It was the usual sleazy
food-machine—two tired waitresses behind a zinc
counter loaded with cigarettes and candy and paperbacks
and comics. There was a big coffee percolator
and a row of butane gas-rings. A door marked <span class="calibre4">RESTROOM</span>
concealed its dreadful secrets next to a door
marked <span class="calibre4">PRIVATE</span> which was probably the back entrance.
A group of overalled men at one of the dozen stained
crueted tables looked up briefly as they came in and
then resumed their low conversation. Relief crews for
the Diesels, Bond guessed.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were four narrow booths on the right of the
entrance and Bond and Solitaire slipped into one of
them. They looked dully at the stained menu card.</p>

<p class="pindent">After a time, one of the waitresses sauntered over
and stood leaning against the partition, running her eyes
over Solitaire’s clothes.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Orange juice, coffee, scrambled eggs, twice,’ said
Bond briefly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘ ’Kay,’ said the girl. Her shoes lethargically scuffed
the floor as she sauntered away.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The scrambled eggs’ll be cooked with milk,’ said
Bond. ‘But one can’t eat boiled eggs in America. They
look so disgusting without their shells, mixed up in a
tea-cup the way they do them here. God knows where
they learned the trick. From Germany, I suppose. And
bad American coffee’s the worst in the world, worse
even than in England. I suppose they can’t do much
harm to the orange juice. After all, we <span class="it">are</span> in Florida
now.’ He suddenly felt depressed by the thought of
their four-hour wait in this unwashed, dog-eared
atmosphere.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Everybody’s making easy money in America these
days,’ said Solitaire. ‘That’s always bad for the customer.
All they want is to strip a quick dollar off you and toss
you out. Wait till you get down to the coast. At this
time of the year, Florida’s the biggest sucker-trap on
earth. On the East Coast they fleece the millionaires.
Where we’re going they just take it off the little man.
Serves him right, of course. He goes there to die. He
can’t take it with him.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘For heaven’s sake,’ said Bond, ‘what sort of a place
are we going to?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Everybody’s nearly dead in St Petersburg,’ explained
Solitaire. ‘It’s the Great American Graveyard. When the
bank clerk or the post-office worker or the railroad
conductor reaches sixty he collects his pension or his
annuity and goes to St Petersburg to get a few years’
sunshine before he dies. It’s called “The Sunshine City”.
The weather’s so good that the evening paper there, the
<span class="it">Independent</span>, is given away free any day the sun hasn’t
shone by edition time. It only happens three or four
times a year and it’s a fine advertisement. Everybody
goes to bed around nine o’clock in the evening and
during the day the old folks play shuffleboard and bridge,
herds of them. There’s a couple of baseball teams down
there, the “Kids” and the “Kubs”, all over seventy-five!
Then they play bowls, but most of the time they sit
squashed together in droves on things called “Sidewalk
Davenports”, rows of benches up and down the sidewalks
of the main streets. They just sit in the sun and
gossip and doze. It’s a terrifying sight, all these old people
with their spectacles and hearing-aids and clicking false-teeth.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sounds pretty grim,’ said Bond. ‘Why the hell did
Mr Big choose this place to operate from?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s perfect for him,’ said Solitaire seriously. ‘There’s
practically no crime, except cheating at bridge and
Canasta. So there’s a very small police force. There’s
quite a big Coastguard Station but it’s mainly concerned
with smuggling between Tampa and Cuba, and sponge-fishing
out of season at Tarpon Springs. I don’t really
know what he does there except that he’s got a big
agent called “The Robber”. Something to do with Cuba,
I expect,’ she added thoughtfully. ‘Probably mixed up
with Communism. I believe Cuba comes under Harlem
and runs red agents all through the Caribbean.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Anyway,’ she went on, ‘St Petersburg is probably the
most innocent town in America. Everything’s very
“folksy” and “gracious”. It’s true there’s a place called
“The Restorium”, a hospital for alcoholics. But very
old ones, I suppose,’ she laughed, ‘and I expect they’re
past doing anyone any harm. You’ll love it,’ she smiled
maliciously at Bond. ‘You’ll probably want to settle
down there for life and be an “Oldster” too. That’s the
great word down there . . . “oldster”.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘God forbid,’ said Bond fervently. ‘It sounds rather
like Bournemouth or Torquay. But a million times worse.
I hope we don’t get into a shooting match with “The
Robber” and his friends. We’d probably hurry a few
hundred oldsters off to the cemetery with heart-failure.
But isn’t there anyone young in this place?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh yes,’ laughed Solitaire. ‘Plenty of them. All the
local inhabitants who take the money off the oldsters,
for instance. The people who own the motels and the
trailer-camps. You could make plenty of money running
the bingo tournaments. I’ll be your “barker”—the girl
outside who gets the suckers in. Dear Mister Bond,’ she
reached over and pressed his hand, ‘will you settle down
with me and grow old gracefully in St Petersburg?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat back and looked at her critically. ‘I want a
long time of disgraceful living with you first,’ he said
with a grin. ‘I’m probably better at that. But it suits me
that they go to bed at nine down there.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Her eyes smiled back at him. She took her hand away
from his as their breakfast arrived. ‘Yes,’ she said. ‘You
go to bed at nine. Then I shall slip out by the back
door and go on the tiles with the Kids and the Kubs.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The breakfast was as bad as Bond had prophesied.</p>

<p class="pindent">When they had paid they wandered over to the station
waiting-room.</p>

<p class="pindent">The sun had risen and the light swarmed in dusty
bars into the vaulted, empty hall. They sat together in
a corner and until the Silver Meteor came in Bond plied
her with questions about The Big Man and all she could
tell him about his operations.</p>

<p class="pindent">Occasionally he made a note of a date or a name but
there was little she could add to what he knew. She had
an apartment to herself in the same Harlem block as
Mr Big and she had been kept virtually a prisoner there
for the past year. She had two tough negresses as
‘companions’ and was never allowed out without a
guard.</p>

<p class="pindent">From time to time Mr Big would have her brought
over to the room where Bond had seen him. There she
would be told to divine whether some man or woman,
generally bound to the chair, was lying or not. She varied
her replies according to whether she sensed these people
were good or evil. She knew that her verdict might
often be a death sentence but she felt indifferent to the
fate of those she judged to be evil. Very few of them
were white.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond jotted down the dates and details of all these
occasions.</p>

<p class="pindent">Everything she told him added to the picture of a
very powerful and active man, ruthless and cruel,
commanding a huge network of operations.</p>

<p class="pindent">All she knew of the gold coins was that she had
several times had to question men on how many they
had passed and the price they had been paid for them.
Very often, she said, they were lying on both counts.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was careful to divulge very little of what he
himself knew or guessed. His growing warmth towards
Solitaire and his desire for her body were in a compartment
which had no communicating door with his
professional life.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Silver Meteor came in on time and they were
both relieved to be on their way again and to get away
from the dreary world of the big junction.</p>

<p class="pindent">The train sped on down through Florida, through
the forests and swamps, stark and bewitched with
Spanish moss, and through the mile upon mile of citrus
groves.</p>

<p class="pindent">All through the centre of the state the moss lent a
dead, spectral feeling to the landscape. Even the little
townships through which they passed had a grey skeletal
aspect with their dried-up, sun-sucked clapboard
houses. Only the citrus groves laden with fruit looked
green and alive. Everything else seemed baked and desiccated
with the heat.</p>

<p class="pindent">Looking out at the gloomy silent withered forests,
Bond thought that nothing could be living in them
except bats and scorpions, horned toads and black
widow spiders.</p>

<p class="pindent">They had lunch and then suddenly the train was
running along the Gulf of Mexico, through the
mangrove swamps and palm groves, endless motels and
caravan sites, and Bond caught the smell of the other
Florida, the Florida of the advertisements, the land of
‘Miss Orange Blossom 1954’.</p>

<p class="pindent">They left the train at Clearwater, the last station before
St Petersburg. Bond took a cab and gave the address
on Treasure Island, half an hour’s drive away. It was
two o’clock and the sun blazed down out of a cloudless
sky. Solitaire insisted on taking off her hat and veil. ‘It’s
sticking to my face,’ she said. ‘Hardly a soul has ever
seen me down here.’</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">A big negro with a face pitted with ancient smallpox
was held up in his cab at the same time as they were
checked at the intersection of Park Street and Central
Avenue, where the Avenue runs on to the long Treasure
Island causeway across the shallow waters of Boca Ciega
Bay.</p>

<p class="pindent">When the negro saw Solitaire’s profile his mouth fell
open. He pulled his cab into the kerb and dived into a
drugstore. He called a St Petersburg number.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Dis is Poxy,’ he said urgently into the mouthpiece.
‘Gimme da Robber ’n step on it. Dat you, Robber?
Lissen, Da Big Man muss be ’n town. Whaddya mean
yuh jes talked wit him ’n New York? Ah jes seen his
gal ’n a Clearwater cab, one of da Stassen Company’s.
Headin’ over da Causeway. Sho Ahm sartin. Cross ma
heart. Couldn mistake dat eyeful. Wid a man ’n a blue
suit, grey Stetson. Seemed like a scar down his face.
Whaddya mean, follow ’em? Ah jes couldn believe yuh
wouldn tell me da Big Man wuz ’n town ef he wuz.
Thought mebbe Ahd better check ’n make sho. Okay,
okay. Ah’ll ketch da cab when he comes back over da
Causeway, else at Clearwater. Okay, okay. Keep yo shirt
on. Ah ain’t done nuthen wrong.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The man called ‘The Robber’ was through to New
York in five minutes. He had been warned about Bond
but he couldn’t understand where Solitaire tied in to
the picture. When he had finished talking to The Big
Man he still didn’t know, but his instructions were quite
definite.</p>

<p class="pindent">He rang off and sat for a while, drumming his fingers
on his desk. Ten Grand for the job. He’d need two men.
That would leave eight Grand for him. He licked his lips
and called a poolroom in a downtown bar in Tampa.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">Bond paid off the cab at The Everglades, a group of
neat white-and-yellow clapboard cottages set on three
sides of a square of Bahama grass which ran fifty yards
down to a bone-white beach and then to the sea. From
there, the whole Gulf of Mexico stretched away, as
calm as a mirror, until the heat-haze on the horizon
married it into the cloudless sky.</p>

<p class="pindent">After London, after New York, after Jacksonville, it
was a sparkling transition.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond went through a door marked <span class="calibre4">OFFICE</span> with Solitaire
demurely at his heels. He rang a bell that said,
<span class="calibre4">MANAGERESS: MRS STUYVESANT</span>, and a withered shrimp
of a woman with blue-rinsed hair appeared and smiled
with her pinched lips. ‘Yes?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mr Leiter?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh yes, you’re Mr Bryce. Cabana Number One, right
down on the beach. Mr Leiter’s been expecting you
since lunchtime. And . . . ?’ She heliographed with her
pince-nez towards Solitaire.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mrs Bryce,’ said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ah yes,’ said Mrs Stuyvesant, wishing to disbelieve.
‘Well, if you’d care to sign the register, I’m sure you
and Mrs Bryce would like to freshen up after the journey.
The full address, please. Thank you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She led them out and down the cement path to the
end cottage on the left. She knocked and Leiter appeared.
Bond had looked forward to a warm welcome, but
Leiter seemed staggered to see him. His mouth hung
open. His straw-coloured hair, still faintly black at the
roots, looked like a haystack.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You haven’t met my wife, I think,’ said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No, no, I mean, yes. How do you do?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The whole situation was beyond him. Forgetting Solitaire,
he almost dragged Bond through the door. At the
last moment he remembered the girl and seized her
with his other hand and pulled her in too, banging the
door shut with his heel so that Mrs Stuyvesant’s ‘I hope
you have a happy . . .’ was guillotined before the ‘stay’.</p>

<p class="pindent">Once inside, Leiter could still not take them in. He
stood and gaped from one to the other.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond dropped his suitcase on the floor of the little
lobby. There were two doors. He pushed open the one
on his right and held it for Solitaire. It was a small living-room
that ran the width of the cottage and faced across
the beach to the sea. It was pleasantly furnished with
bamboo beach chairs upholstered in foam rubber covered
with a red-and-green hibiscus chintz. Palm-leaf matting
covered the floor. The walls were duck’s-egg blue and in
the centre of each was a colour print of tropical flowers
in a bamboo frame. There was a large drum-shaped table
in bamboo with a glass top. It held a bowl of flowers
and a white telephone. There were broad windows facing
the sea and to the right of them a door leading on to
the beach. White plastic jalousies were drawn half up the
windows to cut the glare from the sand.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond and Solitaire sat down. Bond lit a cigarette and
threw the pack and his lighter on to the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly the telephone rang. Leiter came out of his
trance and walked over from the door and picked up
the receiver.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Speaking,’ he said. ‘Put the Lieutenant on. That you,
Lieutenant? He’s here. Just walked in. No, all in one
piece.’ He listened for a moment, then turned to Bond.
‘Where did you leave the Phantom?’ he asked. Bond told
him. ‘Jacksonville,’ said Leiter into the telephone. ‘Yeah,
I’ll say. Sure. I’ll get the details from him and call you
back. Will you call off Homicide? I’d sure appreciate it.
And New York. Much obliged, Lieutenant. Orlando
9000. Okay. And thanks again. ’Bye.’ He put down the
receiver. He wiped the sweat off his forehead and sat
down opposite Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly he looked at Solitaire and grinned apologetically.
‘I guess you’re Solitaire,’ he said. ‘Sorry for the
rough welcome. It’s been quite a day. For the second
time in around twenty-four hours I didn’t expect to see
this guy again.’ He turned back to Bond. ‘Okay to go
ahead?’ he asked.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ said Bond. ‘Solitaire’s on our side now.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s a break,’ said Leiter. ‘Well, you won’t have seen
the papers or heard the radio, so I’ll give you the headlines
first. The Phantom was stopped soon after
Jacksonville. Between Waldo and Ocala. Your compartment
was tommy-gunned and bombed. Blown to bits.
Killed the Pullman porter who was in the corridor at
the time. No other casualties. Bloody uproar going on.
Who did it? Who’s Mr Bryce and who’s Mrs Bryce?
Where are they? Of course we were sure you’d been
snatched. The police at Orlando are in charge. Traced
the bookings back to New York. Found the FBI had
made them. Everyone comes down on me like a load
of bricks. Then you walk in with a pretty girl on your
arm looking as happy as a clam.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter burst out laughing. ‘Boy! You should have heard
Washington a while back. Anybody would have thought
it was me that bombed the goddam train.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He reached for one of Bond’s cigarettes and lit it.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well,’ he said. ‘That’s the synopsis. I’ll hand over the
shooting script when I’ve heard your end. Give.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond described in detail what had happened since he
had spoken to Leiter from the St Regis. When he came
to the night on the train he took the piece of paper out
of his pocket-book and pushed it across the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter whistled. ‘Voodoo,’ he said. ‘This was meant
to be found on the corpse, I guess. Ritual murder by
friends of the men you bumped in Harlem. That’s how
it was supposed to look. Take the heat right away from
The Big Man. They certainly think out all the angles.
We’ll get after that thug they had on the train. Probably
one of the help in the diner. He must have been the
man who put the finger on your compartment. You
finish. Then I’ll tell you how he did it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Let me see,’ said Solitaire. She reached across for the
paper.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ she said quietly. ‘It’s an <span class="it">ouanga</span>, a Voodoo fetish.
It’s the invocation to the Drum Witch. It’s used by the
Ashanti tribe in Africa when they want to kill someone.
They use something like it in Haiti.’ She handed it back
to Bond. ‘It was lucky you didn’t tell me about it,’ she
said seriously. ‘I would still be having hysterics.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I didn’t care for it myself,’ said Bond. ‘I felt it was
bad news. Lucky we got off at Jacksonville. Poor
Baldwin. We owe him a lot.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He finished the story of the rest of their trip.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Anyone spot you when you left the train?’ asked
Leiter.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Shouldn’t think so,’ said Bond. ‘But we’d better keep
Solitaire under cover until we can get her out. Thought
we ought to fly her over to Jamaica tomorrow. I can
get her looked after there till we come on.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sure,’ agreed Leiter. ‘We’ll put her in a charter plane
at Tampa. Get her down to Miami by tomorrow lunchtime
and she can take one of the afternoon services—KLM
or Panam. Get her in by dinner-time tomorrow.
Too late to do anything this afternoon.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Is that all right, Solitaire?’ Bond asked her.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl was staring out of the window. Her eyes had
the faraway look that Bond had seen before.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly she shivered.</p>

<p class="pindent">Her eyes came back to Bond. She put out a hand and
touched his sleeve.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ she said. She hesitated. ‘Yes, I guess so.’</p>
