<div class="lgl"><h1 id="calibre_toc_3" class="calibre1"><a id="Page_012" class="calibre3"></a>2. Interview with M</h1></div>

<p class="pindent">The grey Bentley convertible, the 1933 4½-litre with
the Amherst-Villiers supercharger, had been brought
round a few minutes earlier from the garage where he
kept it and the engine had kicked directly he pressed
the self-starter. He had turned on the twin fog lights
and had driven gingerly along King’s Road and then up
Sloane Street into Hyde Park.</p>

<p class="pindent">M’s Chief of Staff had telephoned at midnight to say
that M wanted to see Bond at nine the next morning.
‘Bit early in the day,’ he had apologized, ‘but he seems
to want some action from somebody. Been brooding
for weeks. Suppose he’s made up his mind at last.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Any line you can give me over the telephone?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A for Apple and C for Charlie,’ said the Chief of
Staff, and rang off.</p>

<p class="pindent">That meant that the case concerned Stations A and
C, the sections of the Secret Service dealing respectively
with the United States and the Caribbean. Bond had
worked for a time under Station A during the war, but
he knew little of C or its problems.</p>

<p class="pindent">As he crawled beside the kerb up through Hyde Park,
the slow drumbeat of his two-inch exhaust keeping him
company, he felt excited at the prospect of his interview
with M, the remarkable man who was then, and still is,
head of the Secret Service. He had not looked into
those cold, shrewd eyes since the end of the summer.
On that occasion M had been pleased.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Take some leave,’ he had said. ‘Plenty of leave. Then
get some new skin grafted over the back of that hand.
“Q” will put you on to the best man and fix a date.
Can’t have you going round with that damn Russian
trade-mark on you. See if I can find you a good target
when you’ve got cleaned up. Good luck.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The hand had been fixed, painlessly but slowly. The
thin scars, the single Russian letter which stands for
<span class="calibre4">SCH</span>, the first letter of <span class="it">Spion</span>, a spy, had been removed,
and as Bond thought of the man with the stiletto who
had cut them he clenched his hands on the wheel.</p>

<p class="pindent">What was happening to the brilliant organization of
which the man with the knife had been an agent, the
Soviet organ of vengeance, <span class="calibre4">SMERSH</span>, short for <span class="it">Smyert
Spionam</span>—Death to Spies? Was it still as powerful, still
as efficient? Who controlled it now that Beria was gone?
After the great gambling case in which he had been
involved at Royale-les-Eaux, Bond had sworn to get
back at them. He had told M as much at that last interview.
Was this appointment with M to start him on his
trail of revenge?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s eyes narrowed as he gazed into the murk of
Regent’s Park and his face in the faint dashlight was
cruel and hard.</p>

<p class="pindent">He drew up in the mews behind the gaunt high
building, handed his car over to one of the plain-clothes
drivers from the pool and walked round to the main
entrance. He was taken up in the lift to the top floor
and along the thickly carpeted corridor he knew so well
to the door next to M’s. The Chief of Staff was waiting
for him and at once spoke to M on the intercom.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘007’s here now, Sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Send him in.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The desirable Miss Moneypenny, M’s all-powerful
private secretary, gave him an encouraging smile and
he walked through the double doors. At once the
green light came on, high on the wall in the room he
had left. M was not to be disturbed as long as it
burned.</p>

<p class="pindent">A reading lamp with a green glass shade made a pool
of light across the red leather top of the broad desk.
The rest of the room was darkened by the fog outside
the windows.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Morning, 007. Let’s have a look at the hand. Not a
bad job. Where did they take the skin from?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘High up on the forearm, Sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hm. Hairs’ll grow a bit thick. Crooked too. However,
can’t be helped. Looks all right for the time being. Sit
down.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked round to the single chair which faced
M across the desk. The grey eyes looked at him, through
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Had a good rest?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes thank you, Sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ever seen one of these?’ M abruptly fished something
out of his waistcoat pocket. He tossed it half way
across the desk towards Bond. It fell with a faint clang
on the red leather and lay, gleaming richly, an inch-wide,
hammered gold coin.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond picked it up, turned it over, weighed it in his
hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No, Sir. Worth about five pounds, perhaps.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Fifteen to a collector. It’s a Rose Noble of Edward
IV.’</p>

<p class="pindent">M fished again in his waistcoat pocket and tossed
more magnificent gold coins on to the table in front
of Bond. As he did so, he glanced at each one and
identified it.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Double Excellente, Spanish, Ferdinand and Isabella,
1510; Ecu au Soleil, French, Charles IX, 1574; Double
Ecu d’or, French, Henry IV, 1600; Double Ducat,
Spanish, Philip II, 1560; Ryder, Dutch, Charles d’Egmond,
1538; Quadruple, Genoa, 1617; Double louis, à la mèche
courte, French, Louis XIV, 1644. Worth a lot of money
melted down. Much more to collectors, ten to twenty
pounds each. Notice anything common to them all?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond reflected. ‘No, Sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All minted before 1650. Bloody Morgan, the pirate,
was Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Jamaica
from 1675 to 1688. The English coin is the joker in the
pack. Probably shipped out to pay the Jamaica garrison.
But for that and the dates, these could have come from
any other treasure-trove put together by the great pirates—L’Ollonais,
Pierre le Grand, Sharp, Sawkins, Blackbeard.
As it is, and both Spinks and the British Museum
agree, this is almost certainly part of Bloody Morgan’s
treasure.’</p>

<p class="pindent">M paused to fill his pipe and light it. He didn’t invite
Bond to smoke and Bond would not have thought of
doing so uninvited.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And the hell of a treasure it must be. So far nearly
a thousand of these and similar coins have turned up
in the United States in the last few months. And if the
Special Branch of the Treasury, and the FBI, have traced
a thousand, how many more have been melted down
or disappeared into private collections? And they keep
on coming in, turning up in banks, bullion merchants,
curio shops, but mostly pawnbrokers of course. The
FBI are in a proper fix. If they put these on the police
notices of stolen property they know the source will
dry up. They’d be melted down into gold bars and
channelled straight into the black bullion market. Have
to sacrifice the rarity value of the coins, but the gold
would go straight underground. As it is, someone’s using
the negroes—porters, sleeping-car attendants, truck-drivers—and
getting the money well spread over the
States. Quite innocent people. Here’s a typical case.’ M
opened a brown folder bearing the Top Secret red star
and selected a single sheet of paper. Through the reverse
side as M held it up, Bond could see the engraved
heading: ‘Department of Justice. Federal Bureau of
Investigations.’ M read from it:</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Zachary Smith, 35, Negro, Member of the Sleeping
Car Porters Brotherhood, address 90b West 126th
Street, New York City.’ (M looked up: ‘Harlem,’ he said.)
‘Subject was identified by Arthur Fein of Fein Jewels
Inc., 870 Lenox Avenue, as having offered for sale on
November 21st last four gold coins of the sixteenth
and seventeenth century (details attached). Fein offered
a hundred dollars which was accepted. Interrogated
later, Smith said they had been sold to him in Seventh
Heaven Bar-B-Q (a well-known Harlem bar) for twenty
dollars each by a negro he had never seen before or
since. Vendor had said they were worth fifty dollars
each at Tiffany’s, but that he, the vendor, wanted ready
cash and Tiffany’s was too far anyway. Smith bought
one for twenty dollars and on finding that a neighbouring
pawnbroker would offer him twenty-five dollars
for it, returned to the bar and purchased the remaining
three for sixty dollars. The next morning he took them
to Fein’s. Subject has no criminal record.’</p>

<p class="pindent">M returned the paper to the brown folder.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s typical,’ he said. ‘Several times they’ve caught
up with the next link, the middle man who bought them
a bit cheaper, and they find that he bought a handful,
in one case a hundred of them, from some man who
presumably got them cheaper still. All these larger transactions
have taken place in Harlem or Florida. Always
the next man in the link was an unknown negro, in all
cases a white-collar man, prosperous, educated, who
said he guessed they were treasure-trove, Blackbeard’s
treasure.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘This Blackbeard story would stand up to most investigations,’
continued M, ‘because there is reason to believe
that part of his hoard was dug up around Christmas Day,
1928, at a place called Plum Point. It’s a narrow neck of
land in Beaufort County, North Carolina, where a stream
called Bath Creek flows into the Pamlico River. Don’t
think I’m an expert,’ he smiled, ‘you can read all about
this in the dossier. So, in theory, it would be quite reasonable
for those lucky treasure-hunters to have hidden the
loot until everyone had forgotten the story and then
thrown it fast on the market. Or else they could have
sold it en bloc at the time, or later, and the purchaser
has just decided to cash in. Anyway it’s a good enough
cover except on two counts.’</p>

<p class="pindent">M paused and relit his pipe.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Firstly, Blackbeard operated from about 1690 to 1710
and it’s improbable that none of his coin should have
been minted later than 1650. Also, as I said before, it’s
very unlikely that his treasure would contain Edward
IV Rose Nobles, since there’s no record of an English
treasure-ship being captured on its way to Jamaica. The
Brethren of the Coast wouldn’t take them on. Too
heavily escorted. There were much easier pickings if
you were sailing in those days “on the plundering
account” as they called it.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Secondly,’ and M looked at the ceiling and then back
at Bond, ‘I know where the treasure is. At least I’m
pretty sure I do. And it’s not in America. It’s in Jamaica,
and it is Bloody Morgan’s, and I guess it’s one of the
most valuable treasure-troves in history.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good Lord,’ said Bond. ‘How . . . where do we come
into it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">M held up his hand. ‘You’ll find all the details in here,’
he let his hand come down on the brown folder. ‘Briefly,
Station C has been interested in a Diesel yacht, the <span class="it">Secatur</span>,
which has been running from a small island on the North
Coast of Jamaica through the Florida Keys into the Gulf
of Mexico, to a place called St Petersburg. Sort of
pleasure resort, near Tampa. West Coast of Florida. With
the help of the FBI we’ve traced the ownership of this
boat and of the island to a man called Mr Big, a negro
gangster. Lives in Harlem. Ever heard of him?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No,’ said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And curiously enough,’ M’s voice was softer and
quieter, ‘a twenty-dollar bill which one of these casual
negroes had paid for a gold coin and whose number
he had noted for Peaka Peow, the Numbers game, was
paid out by one of Mr Big’s lieutenants. And it was
paid,’ M pointed the stem of his pipe at Bond, ‘for
information received, to an FBI double-agent who is
a member of the Communist Party.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond whistled softly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘In short,’ continued M, ‘we suspect that this Jamaican
treasure is being used to finance the Soviet espionage
system, or an important part of it, in America. And our
suspicion becomes a certainty when I tell you who this
Mr Big is.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond waited, his eyes fixed on M’s.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mr Big,’ said M, weighing his words, ‘is probably the
most powerful negro criminal in the world. He is,’ and
he enumerated carefully, ‘the head of the Black Widow
Voodoo cult and believed by that cult to be the Baron
Samedi himself. You’ll find all about that here,’ he tapped
the folder, ‘and it’ll frighten the daylights out of you.
He is also a Soviet agent. And finally he is, and this will
particularly interest you, Bond, a known member of
<span class="calibre4">SMERSH</span>.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ said Bond slowly, ‘I see now.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Quite a case,’ said M, looking keenly at him. ‘And
quite a man, this Mr Big.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I don’t think I’ve ever heard of a great negro criminal
before,’ said Bond, ‘Chinamen, of course, the men
behind the opium trade. There’ve been some big-time
Japs, mostly in pearls and drugs. Plenty of negroes
mixed up in diamonds and gold in Africa, but always
in a small way. They don’t seem to take to big business.
Pretty law-abiding chaps I should have thought, except
when they’ve drunk too much.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Our man’s a bit of an exception,’ said M. ‘He’s not
pure negro. Born in Haiti. Good dose of French blood.
Trained in Moscow, too, as you’ll see from the file. And
the negro races are just beginning to throw up geniuses
in all the professions—scientists, doctors, writers. It’s
about time they turned out a great criminal. After all,
there are 250,000,000 of them in the world. Nearly a
third of the white population. They’ve got plenty of
brains and ability and guts. And now Moscow’s taught
one of them the technique.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’d like to meet him,’ said Bond. Then he added,
mildly, ‘I’d like to meet any member of <span class="calibre4">SMERSH</span>.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right then, Bond. Take it away.’ M handed him
the thick brown folder. ‘Talk it over with Plender and
Damon. Be ready to start in a week. It’s a joint CIA
and FBI job. For God’s sake don’t step on the FBI’s
toes. Covered with corns. Good luck.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had gone straight down to Commander Damon,
Head of Station A, an alert Canadian who controlled
the link with the Central Intelligence Agency, America’s
Secret Service.</p>

<p class="pindent">Damon looked up from his desk. ‘I see you’ve bought
it,’ he said, looking at the folder. ‘Thought you would.
Sit down,’ he waved to an armchair beside the electric
fire. ‘When you’ve waded through it all, I’ll fill in the
gaps.’</p>
