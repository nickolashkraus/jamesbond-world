<p class="pindent">It was not yet light when their guards came for them.
Their leg ropes were cut and with their arms still
pinioned they were led up the remaining stone stairs to
the surface.</p>

<p class="pindent">They stood amongst the sparse trees and Bond sniffed
the cool morning air. He gazed through the trees
towards the east and saw that there the stars were paler
and the horizon luminous with the breaking dawn. The
night-song of the crickets was almost done and somewhere
on the island a mocking bird bubbled its first
notes.</p>

<p class="pindent">He guessed that it was either side of half-past five.</p>

<p class="pindent">They stood there for several minutes. Negroes
brushed past them carrying bundles and jippa-jippa
holdalls, talking in cheerful whispers. The doors of the
handful of thatched huts among the trees had been left
swinging open. The men filed to the edge of the cliff
to the right of where Bond and Solitaire were standing
and disappeared over the edge. They didn’t come back.
It was evacuation. The whole garrison of the island was
decamping.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond rubbed his naked shoulder against Solitaire and
she pressed against him. It was cold after the stuffy
dungeon and Bond shivered. But it was better to be on
the move than for the suspense down below to be
prolonged.</p>

<p class="pindent">They both knew what had to be done, the nature of
the gamble.</p>

<p class="pindent">When The Big Man had left them, Bond had wasted
no time. In a whisper, he had told the girl of the
limpet mine against the side of the ship timed to
explode a few minutes after six o’clock and he had
explained the factors that would decide who would
die that morning.</p>

<p class="pindent">First, he gambled on Mr Big’s mania for exactitude
and efficiency. The <span class="it">Secatur</span> must sail on the dot of six
o’clock. Then there must be no cloud, or visibility in
the half-light of dawn would not be sufficient for the
ship to make the passage through the reef and Mr Big
would postpone the sailing. If Bond and Solitaire were
on the jetty alongside the ship, they would then be killed
with Mr Big.</p>

<p class="pindent">Supposing the ship sailed dead on time, how far
behind and to one side of her would their bodies be
towed? It would have to be on the port side for the
paravane to clear the island. Bond guessed the cable to
the paravane would be fifty yards and that they would
be towed twenty or thirty yards behind the paravane.</p>

<p class="pindent">If he was right, they would be hauled over the outer
reef about fifty yards after the <span class="it">Secatur</span> had cleared the
passage. She would probably approach the passage at
about three knots and then put on speed to ten or even
twenty. At first their bodies would be swept away from
the island in a slow arc, twisting and turning at the end
of the tow-rope. Then the paravane would straighten
out and when the ship had got through the reef, they
would still be approaching it. The paravane would then
cross the reef when the ship was about forty yards
outside it and they would follow.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shuddered to think of the mauling their bodies
would suffer being dragged at any speed over the razor-sharp
ten yards of coral rocks and trees. The skin on
their backs and legs would be flayed off.</p>

<p class="pindent">Once over the reef they would be just a huge bleeding
bait and it would be only a matter of minutes before
the first shark or barracuda was on to them.</p>

<p class="pindent">And Mr Big would sit comfortably in the stern sheets,
watching the bloody show, perhaps with glasses, and
ticking off the seconds and minutes as the living bait
got smaller and smaller and finally the fish snapped at
the bloodstained rope.</p>

<p class="pindent">Until there was nothing left.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then the paravane would be hoisted inboard and the
yacht would plough gracefully on towards the distant
Florida Keys, Cape Sable and the sun-soaked wharf in
St Petersburg Harbour.</p>

<p class="pindent">And if the mine exploded while they were still in the
water, only fifty yards away from the ship? What would
be the effect of the shock-waves on their bodies? It
might not be deadly. The hull of the ship should absorb
most of it. The reef might protect them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond could only guess and hope.</p>

<p class="pindent">Above all they must stay alive to the last possible
second. They must keep breathing as they were hauled,
a living bundle, through the sea. Much depended on how
they would be bound together. Mr Big would want them
to stay alive. He would not be interested in dead bait.</p>

<p class="pindent">If they were still alive when the first shark’s fin showed
on the surface behind them Bond had coldly decided
to drown Solitaire. Drown her by twisting her body
under his and holding her there. Then he would try and
drown himself by twisting her dead body back over his
to keep him under.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was nightmare at every turn of his thoughts,
sickening horror in every grisly aspect of the monstrous
torture and death this man had invented for them. But
Bond knew he must remain cold and absolutely resolved
to fight for their lives to the end. There was at least
warmth in the knowledge that Mr Big and most of his
men would also die. And there was a glimmer of hope
that he and Solitaire would survive. Unless the mine
failed, there was no such hope for the enemy.</p>

<p class="pindent">All this, and a hundred other details and plans, went
through Bond’s mind in the last hour before they were
brought up the shaft to the surface. He shared all his
hopes with Solitaire. None of his fears.</p>

<p class="pindent">She had lain opposite him, her tired blue eyes fixed
on him, obedient, trusting, drinking in his face and his
words, pliant, loving.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t worry about me, my darling,’ she had said
when the men came for them. ‘I am happy to be with
you again. My heart is full of it. For some reason I am
not afraid although there is much death very close. Do
you love me a little?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ said Bond. ‘And we shall have our love.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Giddap,’ said one of the men.</p>

<p class="pindent">And now, on the surface, it was getting lighter, and
from below the cliff Bond heard the great twin Diesels
stutter and roar. There was a light flutter of breeze to
windward, but to leeward, where the ship lay, the bay
was a gunmetal mirror.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Big appeared up the shaft, a businessman’s leather
brief-case in his hand. He stood for a moment looking
round, gaining his breath. He paid no attention to Bond
and Solitaire nor to the two guards standing beside them
with revolvers in their hands.</p>

<p class="pindent">He looked up at the sky, and suddenly called out, in
a loud clear voice, towards the rim of the sun:</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thank you, Sir Henry Morgan. Your treasure will be
well spent. Give us a fair wind.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The negro guards showed the whites of their eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The Undertaker’s Wind it is,’ said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Big Man looked at him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All down?’ he asked the guards.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yassuh, Boss,’ answered one of them.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Take them along,’ said The Big Man.</p>

<p class="pindent">They went to the edge of the cliff and down the
steep steps, one guard in front, one behind. Mr Big
followed.</p>

<p class="pindent">The engines of the long graceful yacht were turning
over quietly, the exhaust bubbling glutinously, a thread
of blue vapour rising astern.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were two men on the jetty at the guide ropes.
There were only three men on deck besides the Captain
and the navigator on the grey streamlined bridge. There
was no room for more. All the available deckspace, save
for a fishing chair rigged right aft, was covered with
fish-tanks. The Red Ensign had been struck and only
the Stars and Stripes hung motionless at the stern.</p>

<p class="pindent">A few yards clear of the ship the red torpedo-shaped
paravane, about six feet long, lay quietly on the water,
now aquamarine in the early dawn. It was attached to
a thick pile of wire cable, coiled up on the deck aft. To
Bond there looked to be a good fifty yards of it. The
water was crystal clear and there were no fish about.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Undertaker’s Wind was almost dead. Soon the
Doctor’s Wind would start to breathe in from the sea.
How soon? wondered Bond. Was it an omen?</p>

<p class="pindent">Away beyond the ship he could see the roof of Beau
Desert among the trees, but the jetty and the ship and
the cliff path were still in deep shadow. Bond wondered
if night-glasses would be able to pick them out. And
if they could, what Strangways would be thinking.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Big stood on the jetty and supervised the process
of binding them together.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Strip her,’ he said to Solitaire’s guard.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond flinched. He stole a glance at Mr Big’s wrist
watch. It said ten minutes to six. Bond kept silence.
There must not be even a minute’s delay.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Throw the clothes on board,’ said Mr Big. ‘Tie some
strips round his shoulder. I don’t want any blood in the
water yet.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Solitaire’s clothes were cut off her with a knife.</p>

<p class="pindent">She stood pale and naked. She hung her head and
the heavy black hair fell forward over her face. Bond’s
shoulder was roughly bound with strips of her linen
skirt.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You bastard,’ said Bond through his teeth.</p>

<p class="pindent">Under Mr Big’s direction, their hands were freed.
Their bodies were pressed together, face to face, and
their arms held round each other’s waists and then
bound tightly again.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond felt Solitaire’s soft breasts pressed against him.
She leant her chin on his right shoulder.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I didn’t want it to be like this,’ she whispered
tremulously.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond didn’t answer. He hardly felt her body. He was
counting seconds.</p>

<p class="pindent">On the jetty there was a pile of rope to the paravane.
It hung down off the jetty and Bond could see it lying
along the sand until it rose to meet the belly of the red
torpedo.</p>

<p class="pindent">The free end was tied under their armpits and knotted
tightly between them in the space between their necks.
It was all very carefully done. There was no possible
escape.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was counting the seconds. He made it five
minutes to six.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Big had a last look at them.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Their legs can stay free,’ he said. ‘They’ll make appetizing
bait.’ He stepped off the jetty on to the deck of
the yacht.</p>

<p class="pindent">The two guards went aboard. The two men on the
jetty unhitched their lines and followed. The screws
churned up the still water and with the engines at
half speed ahead the <span class="it">Secatur</span> slid swiftly away from
the island.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Big went aft and sat down in the fishing chair.
They could see his eyes fixed on them. He said nothing.
Made no gesture. He just watched.</p>

<p class="pindent">The <span class="it">Secatur</span> cut through the water towards the reef.
Bond could see the cable to the paravane snaking over
the side. The paravane started to move softly after the
ship. Suddenly it put its nose down, then righted itself
and sped away, its rudder pulling out and away from
the wake of the ship.</p>

<p class="pindent">The coil of rope beside them leapt into life.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Look out,’ said Bond urgently, holding tighter to the
girl.</p>

<p class="pindent">Their arms were pulled almost out of their sockets
as they were jerked together off the jetty into the sea.</p>

<p class="pindent">For a second they both went under, then they were
on the surface, their joined bodies smashing through
the water.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gasped for breath amongst the waves and spray
that dashed past his twisted mouth. He could hear the
rasping of Solitaire’s breath next to his ear.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Breathe, breathe,’ he shouted through the rushing
of the water. ‘Lock your legs against mine.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She heard him and he felt her knees pressing between
his thighs. She had a paroxysm of coughing, then her
breath became more even against his ear and the
thumping of her heart eased against his breast. At the
same time their speed slackened.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hold your breath,’ shouted Bond. ‘I’ve got to have
a look. Ready?’</p>

<p class="pindent">A pressure of her arms answered him. He felt her
chest heave as she filled her lungs.</p>

<p class="pindent">With the weight of his body he swung her round so
that his head was now quite out of water.</p>

<p class="pindent">They were ploughing along at about three knots. He
twisted his head above the small bow-wave they were
throwing up.</p>

<p class="pindent">The <span class="it">Secatur</span> was entering the passage through the reef,
about eighty yards away, he guessed. The paravane was
skimming slowly along almost at right angles to her.
Another thirty yards and the red torpedo would be
crossing the broken water over the reef. A further thirty
yards behind, they were riding slowly across the surface
of the bay.</p>

<p class="pindent">Sixty yards to go to the reef.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond twisted his body and Solitaire came up, gasping.</p>

<p class="pindent">Still they moved slowly along through the water.</p>

<p class="pindent">Five yards, ten, fifteen, twenty.</p>

<p class="pindent">Only forty yards to go before they hit the coral.</p>

<p class="pindent">The <span class="it">Secatur</span> would be just through: Bond gathered his
breath. It must be past six now. What had happened to
the blasted mine? Bond thought a quick fervent prayer.
God save us, he said into the water.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly he felt the rope tighten under his arms.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Breathe, Solitaire, breathe,’ he shouted as they got
under way and the water started to hiss past them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now they were flying over the sea towards the
crouching reef.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a slight check. Bond guessed that the
paravane had fouled a niggerhead or a piece of surface
coral. Then their bodies hurtled on again in their deadly
embrace.</p>

<p class="pindent">Thirty yards to go, twenty, ten.</p>

<p class="pindent">Jesus Christ, thought Bond. We’re for it. He braced
his muscles to take the crashing, searing pain, edged
Solitaire further above him to protect her from the
worst of it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly the breath whistled out of his body and a
giant fist thumped him into Solitaire so that she rose
right out of the sea above him and then fell back. A
split second later lightning flashed across the sky and
there was the thunder of an explosion.</p>

<p class="pindent">They stopped dead in the water and Bond felt the
weight of the slack rope pulling them under.</p>

<p class="pindent">His legs sank down beneath his stunned body and
water rushed into his mouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was this that brought him back to consciousness.
His legs pounded under him and brought their mouths
to the surface. The girl was a dead weight in his arms.
He trod water desperately and looked round him,
holding Solitaire’s lolling head on his shoulder above
the surface.</p>

<p class="pindent">The first thing he saw was the swirling water of the
reef not five yards away. Without its protection they
would both have been crushed by the shock-wave of
the explosion. He felt the tug and eddy of its currents
round his legs. He backed desperately towards it,
catching gulps of air when he could. His chest was
bursting with the strain and he saw the sky through a
red film. The rope dragged him down and the girl’s hair
filled his mouth and tried to choke him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly he felt the sharp scrape of the coral against
the backs of his legs. He kicked and felt frantically with
his feet for a foothold, flaying the skin off with every
movement.</p>

<p class="pindent">He hardly felt the pain.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now his back was being scraped, and his arms. He
floundered clumsily, his lungs burning in his chest. Then
there was a bed of needles under his feet. He put all
his weight on it, leaning back against the strong eddies
that tried to dislodge him. His feet held and there was
rock at his back. He leant back panting, blood streaming
up around him in the water, holding the girl’s cold,
scarcely breathing body against him.</p>

<p class="pindent">For a minute he rested, blessedly, his eyes shut and
the blood pounding through his limbs, coughing painfully,
waiting for his senses to focus again. His first
thought was for the blood in the water around him.
But he guessed the big fish would not venture into the
reef. Anyway there was nothing he could do about it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he looked out to sea.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was no sign of the <span class="it">Secatur</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">High up in the still sky there was a mushroom of
smoke, beginning to trail, with the Doctor’s Wind, in
towards the land.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were things strewn all over the water and a
few heads bobbing up and down and the whole sea
was glinting with the white stomachs of fish stunned
or killed by the explosion. There was a strong smell of
explosive in the air. On the fringe of the debris, the
red paravane lay quietly, hull down, anchored by the cable
whose other end must lie somewhere on the bottom.
Fountains of bubbles were erupting on the glassy surface
of the sea.</p>

<p class="pindent">On the edge of the circle of bobbing heads and dead
fish a few triangular fins were cutting fast through the
water. More appeared as Bond watched. Once he saw
a great snout come out of the water and smash down
on something. The fins threw up spray as they flashed
among the tidbits. Two black arms suddenly stuck up
in the air and then disappeared. There were screams.
Two or three pairs of arms started to flail the water
towards the reef. One man stopped to bang the water in
front of him with the flat of his hand. Then his hands
disappeared under the surface. Then he too began to
scream and his body jerked to and fro in the water.
Barracuda hitting into him, said Bond’s dazed mind.</p>

<p class="pindent">But one of the heads was getting nearer, making for
the bit of reef where Bond stood, the small waves
breaking under his armpits, the girl’s black hair hanging
down his back.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a large head and a veil of blood streamed
down over the face from a wound in the great bald
skull.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond watched it come on.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Big Man was executing a blundering breaststroke,
making enough flurry in the water to attract any
fish that wasn’t already occupied.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond wondered whether he would make it. Bond’s
eyes narrowed and his breath became calmer as he
watched the cruel sea for its decision.</p>

<p class="pindent">The surging head came nearer. Bond could see the
teeth showing in a rictus of agony and frenzied endeavour.
Blood half veiled the eyes that Bond knew would
be bulging in their sockets. He could almost hear the
great diseased heart thumping under the grey-black skin.
Would it give out before the bait was taken?</p>

<p class="pindent">The Big Man came on. His shoulders were naked,
his clothes stripped off him by the explosion, Bond
supposed, but the black silk tie had remained and it
showed round the thick neck and streamed behind the
head like a Chinaman’s pigtail.</p>

<p class="pindent">A splash of water cleared some blood away from the
eyes. They were wide open, staring madly towards Bond.
They held no appeal for help, only a fixed glare of
physical exertion.</p>

<p class="pindent">Even as Bond looked into them, now only ten yards
away, they suddenly shut and the great face contorted
in a grimace of pain.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Aarrh,’ said the distorted mouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">Both arms stopped flailing the water and the head
went under and came up again. A cloud of blood welled
up and darkened the sea. Two six-foot thin brown
shadows backed out of the cloud and then dashed back
into it. The body in the water jerked sideways. Half of
The Big Man’s left arm came out of the water. It had
no hand, no wrist, no wrist watch.</p>

<p class="pindent">But the great turnip head, the drawn-back mouth full
of white teeth almost splitting it in half, was still alive.
And now it was screaming, a long gurgling scream that
only broke each time a barracuda hit into the dangling
body.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a distant shout from the bay behind Bond.
He paid no attention. All his senses were focused on
the horror in the water in front of him.</p>

<p class="pindent">A fin split the surface a few yards away and stopped.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond could feel the shark pointing like a dog, the
short-sighted pink button eyes trying to pierce the cloud
of blood and weigh up the prey. Then it shot in towards
the chest and the screaming head went under as sharply
as a fisherman’s float.</p>

<p class="pindent">Some bubbles burst on the surface.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was the swirl of a sharp brown-spotted tail as
the huge Leopard shark backed out to swallow and
attack again.</p>

<p class="pindent">The head floated back to the surface. The mouth was
closed. The yellow eyes seemed still to look at Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then the shark’s snout came right out of the water
and it drove in towards the head, the lower curved jaw
open so that light glinted on the teeth. There was a
horrible grunting scrunch and a great swirl of water.
Then silence.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s dilated eyes went on staring at the brown stain
that spread wider and wider across the sea.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then the girl moaned and Bond came to his
senses.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was another shout from behind him and he
turned his head towards the bay.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was Quarrel, his brown gleaming chest towering
above the slim hull of a canoe, his arms flailing at the
paddle, and a long way behind him all the other canoes
of Shark Bay skimming like water-boatmen across the
small waves that had started to ripple the surface.</p>

<p class="pindent">The fresh north-east trade winds had started to blow
and the sun was shining down on the blue water and
on the soft green flanks of Jamaica.</p>

<p class="pindent">The first tears since his childhood came into James
Bond’s blue-grey eyes and ran down his drawn cheeks
into the blood-stained sea.</p>
