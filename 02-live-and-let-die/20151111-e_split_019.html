<p class="pindent">Paw-paw with a slice of green lime, a dish piled with
red bananas, purple star-apples and tangerines, scrambled
eggs and bacon, Blue Mountain coffee—the most
delicious in the world—Jamaican marmalade, almost
black, and guava jelly.</p>

<p class="pindent">As Bond, wearing shorts and sandals, had his breakfast
on the veranda and gazed down on the sunlit
panorama of Kingston and Port Royal, he thought how
lucky he was and what wonderful moments of consolation
there were for the darkness and danger of his
profession.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond knew Jamaica well. He had been there on a
long assignment just after the war when the Communist
headquarters in Cuba was trying to infiltrate the Jamaican
labour unions. It had been an untidy and inconclusive
job but he had grown to love the great green island and
its staunch, humorous people. Now he was glad to be
back and to have a whole week of respite before the
grim work began again.</p>

<p class="pindent">After breakfast, Strangways appeared on the veranda
with a tall brown-skinned man in a faded blue shirt and
old brown twill trousers.</p>

<p class="pindent">This was Quarrel, the Cayman Islander, and Bond liked
him immediately. There was the blood of Cromwellian
soldiers and buccaneers in him and his face was strong
and angular and his mouth was almost severe. His eyes
were grey. It was only the spatulate nose and the pale
palms of his hands that were negroid.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shook him by the hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good morning, Cap’n,’ said Quarrel. Coming from
the most famous race of seamen in the world, this was
the highest title he knew. But there was no desire to
please, or humility, in his voice. He was speaking as
mate of the ship and his manner was straightforward
and candid.</p>

<p class="pindent">That moment defined their relationship. It remained
that of a Scots laird with his head stalker; authority was
unspoken and there was no room for servility.</p>

<p class="pindent">After discussing their plans, Bond took the wheel of
the little car Quarrel had brought up from Kingston
and they started on up the Junction Road, leaving
Strangways to busy himself with Bond’s requirements.</p>

<p class="pindent">They had got off before nine and it was still cool as
they crossed the mountains that run along Jamaica’s
back like the central ridges of a crocodile’s armour. The
road wound down towards the northern plains through
some of the most beautiful scenery in the world, the
tropical vegetation changing with the altitude. The green
flanks of the uplands, all feathered with bamboo interspersed
with the dark, glinting green of breadfruit and
the sudden Bengal fire of Flame of the Forest, gave
way to the lower forests of ebony, mahogany, mahoe
and logwood. And when they reached the plains of
Agualta Vale the green sea of sugar-cane and bananas
stretched away to where the distant fringe of glittering
shrapnel bursts marked the palm-groves along the north
coast.</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel was a good companion on the drive and a
wonderful guide. He talked about the trap-door spiders
as they passed through the famous palm-gardens of
Castleton, he told about a fight he had witnessed
between a giant centipede and a scorpion and he
explained the difference between the male and female
paw-paw. He described the poisons of the forest
and the healing properties of tropical herbs, the pressure
the palm kernel develops to break open its coconut, the
length of a humming-bird’s tongue, and how crocodiles
carry their young in their mouths laid lengthways like
sardines in a tin.</p>

<p class="pindent">He spoke exactly but without expertise, using Jamaican
language in which plants ‘strive’ or ‘quail’, moths are
‘bats’ and ‘love’ is used instead of ‘like’. As he talked
he would raise his hand in greeting to the people on
the road and they would wave back and shout his
name.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You seem to know a lot of people,’ said Bond as
the driver of a bulging bus with <span class="calibre4">ROMANCE</span> in large
letters over the windshield gave him a couple of
welcoming blasts on his windhorn.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I bin watching Surprise for tree muns, Cap’n,’
answered Quarrel, ‘ ’n I been travelling this road twice
a week. Everyone soon know you in Jamaica. They got
good eyes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">By half-past ten they had passed through Port Maria
and branched off along the little parochial road that
runs down to Shark Bay. Round a turning they suddenly
came on it below them and Bond stopped the car and
they got out.</p>

<p class="pindent">The bay was crescent shaped, perhaps three-quarters
of a mile wide at its arms. Its blue surface was ruffled
by a light breeze blowing from the north-east, the edge
of the Trade Winds that are born five hundred miles
away in the Gulf of Mexico and then go on their long
journey round the world.</p>

<p class="pindent">A mile from where they stood, a long line of breakers
showed the reef just outside the bay and the narrow
untroubled waters of the passage which was the only
entrance to the anchorage. In the centre of the crescent,
the Isle of Surprise rose a hundred feet sheer out of
the water, small waves creaming against its easterly base,
calm waters in its lee.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was nearly round, and it looked like a tall grey cake
topped with green icing on a blue china plate.</p>

<p class="pindent">They had stopped about a hundred feet above the
little cluster of fishermen’s huts behind the palm-fringed
beach of the bay and they were level with the flat green
top of the island, half a mile away. Quarrel pointed out
the thatched roofs of the wattle-and-daub shanties
among the trees in the centre of the island. Bond examined
them through Quarrel’s binoculars. There was no
sign of life except a thin wisp of smoke blowing away
with the breeze.</p>

<p class="pindent">Below them, the water of the bay was pale green on
the white sand. Then it deepened to dark blue just
before the broken brown of a submerged fringe of
inner reef that made a wide semicircle a hundred yards
from the island. Then it was dark blue again with patches
of lighter blue and aquamarine. Quarrel said that the
depth of the <span class="it">Secatur</span>’s anchorage was about thirty feet.</p>

<p class="pindent">To their left, in the middle of the western arms of
the bay, deep among the trees behind a tiny white sand
beach, was their base of operations, Beau Desert.
Quarrel described its layout and Bond stood for ten
minutes examining the three-hundred-yard stretch of
sea between it and the <span class="it">Secatur</span>’s anchorage up against
the island.</p>

<p class="pindent">In all, Bond spent an hour reconnoitring the place,
then, without going near their house or the village, they
turned the car and got back on the main coast road.</p>

<p class="pindent">They drove on through the beautiful little banana port
of Oracabessa and Ocho Rios with its huge new bauxite
plant, along the north shore to Montego Bay, two hours
away. It was now February and the season was in full
swing. The little village and the straggle of large hotels
were bathed in the four months’ gold-rush that sees
them through the whole year. They stopped at a rest-house
on the other side of the wide bay and had lunch
and then drove on through the heat of the afternoon
to the western tip of the island, two hours further on.</p>

<p class="pindent">Here, because of the huge coastal swamps, nothing
has happened since Columbus used Manatee Bay as a
casual anchorage. Jamaican fishermen have taken the
place of the Arawak Indians, but otherwise there is the
impression that time has stood still.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond thought it the most beautiful beach he had ever
seen, five miles of white sand sloping easily into the
breakers and, behind, the palm trees marching in
graceful disarray to the horizon. Under them, the grey
canoes were pulled up beside pink mounds of discarded
conch shells, and among them smoke rose from the
palm thatch cabins of the fishermen in the shade
between the swamp-lands and the sea.</p>

<p class="pindent">In a clearing among the cabins, set on a rough lawn
of Bahama grass, was the house on stilts built as a
week-end cottage for the employees of the West Indian
Citrus Company. It was built on stilts to keep the
termites at bay and it was closely wired against mosquito
and sandfly. Bond drove off the rough track and parked
under the house. While Quarrel chose two rooms and
made them comfortable Bond put a towel round his
waist and walked through the palm trees to the sea,
twenty yards away.</p>

<p class="pindent">For an hour he swam and lazed in the warm buoyant
water, thinking of Surprise and its secret, fixing those
three hundred yards in his mind, wondering about the
shark and barracuda and the other hazards of the sea,
that great library of books one cannot read.</p>

<p class="pindent">Walking back to the little wooden bungalow, Bond
picked up his first sandfly bites. Quarrel chuckled when
he saw the flat bumps on his back that would soon start
to itch maddeningly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Can’t do nuthen to keep them away, Cap’n,’ he said.
‘But Ah kin stop them ticklin’. You best take a shower
first to git the salt off. They only bites hard for an
hour in the evenin’ and then they likes salt with their
dinner.’</p>

<p class="pindent">When Bond came out of the shower Quarrel
produced an old medicine bottle and swabbed the bites
with a brown liquid that smelled of creosote.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We get more skeeters and sandfly in the Caymans
than anywheres else in the world,’ he said, ‘but we gives
them no attention so long as we got this medicine.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The ten minutes of tropical twilight brought its quick
melancholy and then the stars and the three-quarter
moon blazed down and the sea died to a whisper. There
was the short lull between the two great winds of
Jamaica, and then the palms began to whisper again.</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel jerked his head towards the window.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘De “Undertaker’s Wind”,’ he commented.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How’s that?’ asked Bond, startled.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘On-and-off shore breeze de sailors call it,’ said
Quarrel. ‘De Undertaker blow de bad air out of de
Island night-times from six till six. Then every morning
de “Doctor’s Wind” come and blow de sweet air in
from de sea. Leastwise dat’s what we calls dem in
Jamaica.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel looked quizzically at Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Guess you and de Undertaker’s Wind got much de
same job, Cap’n,’ he said half-seriously.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed shortly. ‘Glad I don’t have to keep the
same hours,’ he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">Outside, the crickets and the tree-frogs started to zing
and tinkle and the great hawkmoths came to the wire-netting
across the windows and clutched it, gazing with
trembling ecstasy at the two oil lamps that hung from
the cross-beams inside.</p>

<p class="pindent">Occasionally a pair of fishermen, or a group of
giggling girls, would walk by down the beach on their
way to the single tiny rum-shop at the point of the bay.
No man walked alone for fear of the duppies under
the trees, or the rolling calf, the ghastly animal that
comes rolling towards you along the ground, its legs in
chains and flames coming out of its nostrils.</p>

<p class="pindent">While Quarrel prepared one of the succulent meals
of fish and eggs and vegetables that were to be their
staple diet, Bond sat under the light and pored over
the books that Strangways had borrowed from the
Jamaica Institute, books on the tropical sea and its
denizens by Beebe and Allyn and others, and on submarine
hunting by Cousteau and Hass. When he set
out to cross those three hundred yards of sea, he was
determined to do it expertly and to leave nothing to
chance. He knew the calibre of Mr Big and he guessed
that the defences of Surprise would be technically brilliant.
He thought they would not involve simple
weapons like guns and high explosives. Mr Big needed
to work undisturbed by the police. He had to keep out
of reach of the law. He guessed that somehow the
forces of the sea had been harnessed to do The Big
Man’s work for him and it was on these that he concentrated,
on murder by shark and barracuda, perhaps by
manta ray and octopus.</p>

<p class="pindent">The facts set out by the naturalists were chilling and
awe-inspiring, but the experiences of Cousteau in the
Mediterranean and of Hass in the Red Sea and Caribbean
were more encouraging.</p>

<p class="pindent">That night Bond’s dreams were full of terrifying
encounters with giant squids and stingrays, hammerheads
and the sawteeth of barracuda, so that he
whimpered and sweated in his sleep.</p>

<p class="pindent">On the next day he started his training under the
critical, appraising eyes of Quarrel. Every morning he
swam a mile up the beach before breakfast and then
ran back along the firm sand to the bungalow. At about
nine they would set out in a canoe, the single triangular
sail taking them fast through the water up the coast to
Bloody Bay and Orange Bay where the sand ends in
cliffs and small coves and the reef is close in against
the coast.</p>

<p class="pindent">Here they would beach the canoe and Quarrel would
take him out with spears and masks and an old underwater
harpoon gun on breathtaking expeditions in the
sort of waters he would encounter in Shark Bay.</p>

<p class="pindent">They hunted quietly, a few yards apart, Quarrel
moving effortlessly in an element in which he was almost
at home.</p>

<p class="pindent">Soon Bond too learned not to fight the sea but always
to give and take with the currents and eddies and not
to struggle against them, to use judo tactics in the
water.</p>

<p class="pindent">On the first day he came home cut and poisoned by
the coral and with a dozen sea-egg spines in his side.
Quarrel grinned and treated the wounds with merthiolate
and Milton. Then, as every evening, he massaged
Bond for half an hour with palm oil, talking quietly the
while about the fish they had seen that day, explaining
the habits of the carnivores and the ground-feeders,
the camouflage of fish and their machinery for changing
colour through the blood stream.</p>

<p class="pindent">He also had never known fish to attack a man except
in desperation or because there was blood in the water.
He explained that fish are rarely hungry in tropical
waters and that most of their weapons are for defence
and not for attack. The only exception, he admitted,
was the barracuda. ‘Mean fish,’ he called them, fearless
since they knew no enemy except disease, capable of
fifty miles an hour over short distances, and with the
worst battery of teeth of any fish in the sea.</p>

<p class="pindent">One day they shot a ten-pounder that had been
hanging round them, melting into the grey distances
and then reappearing, silent, motionless in the upper
water, its angry tiger’s eyes glaring at them so close that
they could see its gills working softly and the teeth
glinting like a wolf’s along its cruel underslung jaw.</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel finally took the harpoon gun from Bond and
shot it, badly, through the streamlined belly. It came
straight for them, its jaws on their great hinges wide
open like a striking rattle-snake. Bond made a wild
lunge at it with his spear just as it was on to Quarrel.
He missed but the spear went between its jaws. They
immediately snapped shut on the steel shaft, and as the
fish tore the spear out of Bond’s hand, Quarrel stabbed
at it with his knife and it went mad, dashing through
the water with its entrails hanging out, the spear clenched
between its teeth, and the harpoon dangling from its
body. Quarrel could scarcely hold the line as the fish
tried to tear the wide barb through the walls of its
stomach, but he moved with it towards a piece of
submerged reef and climbed on to it and slowly pulled
the fish in.</p>

<p class="pindent">When Quarrel had cut its throat and they twisted the
spear out of its jaws they found bright, deep scratches
in the steel.</p>

<p class="pindent">They took the fish ashore and Quarrel cut its head
off and opened the jaws with a piece of wood. The
upper jaw rose in an enormous gape, almost at right
angles to the lower, and revealed a fantastic battery of
razor-sharp teeth, so crowded that they overlapped like
shingles on a roof. Even the tongue had several runs
of small pointed recurved teeth and, in front, there
were two huge fangs that projected forward like a
snake’s.</p>

<p class="pindent">Although it only weighed just over ten pounds, it was
over four feet long, a nickel bullet of muscle and hard
flesh.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We shoot no more ’cudas,’ said Quarrel. ‘But for you
I been in hospital for a month and mebbe lost ma face.
It was foolish of me. If we swim towards it, it gone
away. Dey always do. Dey cowards like all fish. Doan
you worry bout those,’ he pointed at the teeth. ‘You
never see dem again.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I hope not,’ said Bond. ‘I haven’t got a face to
spare.’</p>

<p class="pindent">By the end of the week, Bond was sunburned and
hard. He had cut his cigarettes down to ten a day and
had not had a single drink. He could swim two miles
without tiring, his hand was completely healed and all
the scales of big city life had fallen from him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel was pleased. ‘You ready for Surprise, Cap’n,’
he said, ‘and I not like be de fish what tries to eat
you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Towards nightfall on the eighth day they came back
to the rest-house to find Strangways waiting for
them.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ve got some good news for you,’ he said. ‘Your
friend Felix Leiter’s going to be all right. At all events
he’s not going to die. They’ve had to amputate the
remains of an arm and a leg. Now the plastic surgery
chaps have started building up his face. They called me
up from St Petersburg yesterday. Apparently he insisted
on getting a message to you. First thing he thought of
when he could think at all. Says he’s sorry not to be
with you and to tell you not to get your feet wet—or
at any rate, not as wet as he did.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s heart was full. He looked out of the window.
‘Tell him to get well quickly,’ he said abruptly. ‘Tell him
I miss him.’ He looked back into the room. ‘Now what
about the gear? Everything okay?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ve got it all,’ said Strangways, ‘and the <span class="it">Secatur</span> sails
tomorrow for Surprise. After clearing at Port Maria,
they should anchor before nightfall. Mr Big’s on board—only
the second time he’s been down here. Oh, and
they’ve got a woman with them. Girl called Solitaire,
according to the CIA. Know anything about her?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not much,’ said Bond. ‘But I’d like to get her away
from him. She’s not one of his team.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sort of damsel in distress,’ said the romantic Strangways.
‘Good show. According to the CIA she’s a
corker.’</p>

<p class="pindent">But Bond had gone out on the veranda and was
gazing up at his stars. Never before in his life had there
been so much to play for. The secret of the treasure,
the defeat of a great criminal, the smashing of a
Communist spy ring, and the destruction of a tentacle
of <span class="calibre4">SMERSH</span>, the cruel machine that was his own private
target. And now Solitaire, the ultimate personal prize.</p>

<p class="pindent">The stars winked down their cryptic morse and he
had no key to their cipher.</p>
