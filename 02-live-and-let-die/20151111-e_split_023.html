<p class="pindent">They climbed slowly up, past an open door near the
ceiling, for about forty feet and then paused on a wide
landing in the rock. Here a single negro with an acetylene
light beside him was fitting trays full of gold coin
into the centre of the fish-tanks, scores of which were
stacked against the wall.</p>

<p class="pindent">As they waited, two negroes came down the steps
from the surface, picked up one of the prepared tanks
and went back up the steps with it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond guessed the tanks were stocked with sand and
weed and fish somewhere up above and then passed to
the human chain that stretched down the cliff face.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond noticed that some of the waiting tanks had
gold ingots fitted in the centre, and others a gravel of
jewels, and he revised his estimate of the treasure,
quadrupling it to around four million sterling.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Big stood for a few moments with his eyes on
the stone floor. His breathing was deep but controlled.
Then they went on up.</p>

<p class="pindent">Twenty steps higher there was another landing,
smaller and with a door leading off it. The door had
a new chain and padlock on it. The door itself was
made of platted iron slats, brown and corroded with
rust.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Big paused again and they stood side by side on
the small platform of rock.</p>

<p class="pindent">For a moment Bond thought of escape, but, as if
reading his mind, the negro guard crowded him up
against the stone wall away from The Big Man. And
Bond knew his first duty was to stay alive and get to
Solitaire and somehow keep her away from the doomed
ship where the acid was slowly eating through the copper
of the time-fuse.</p>

<p class="pindent">From above, a strong draught of cold air was coming
down the shaft and Bond felt the sweat drying on him.
He put his right hand up to the wound in his shoulder,
undeterred by the prick of the guard’s dagger in his
side. The blood was dry and caked and most of the
arm was numb. It ached viciously.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Big spoke.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That wind, Mister Bond,’ he pointed up the shaft,
‘is known in Jamaica as “The Undertaker’s Wind”.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shrugged his right shoulder and saved his
breath.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Big turned to the iron door, took a key from his
pocket and unlocked it. He went through and Bond
and his guard followed.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a long, narrow passage of a room with rusty
shackles low down in the walls at less than yard
intervals.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the far end, where a hurricane light hung from
the stone roof, there was a motionless figure under a
blanket on the floor. There was one more hurricane
light over their heads near the door, otherwise nothing
but a smell of damp rock, and ancient torture, and
death.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Solitaire,’ said Mr Big softly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s heart leapt and he started forward. At once a
huge hand grasped him by the arm.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hold it, white man,’ snapped his guard and twisted
his wrist up between his shoulder-blades, hefting it
higher until Bond lashed out with his left heel. It hit
the other man’s shin, and hurt Bond more than the
guard.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Big turned round. He had a small gun almost
covered by his huge hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Let him go,’ he said, quietly. ‘If you want an extra
navel, Mister Bond, you can have one. I have six of
them in this gun.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond brushed past The Big Man. Solitaire was on
her feet, coming towards him. When she saw his face
she broke into a run, holding out her two hands.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘James,’ she sobbed. ‘James.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She almost fell at his feet. Their hands clutched at
each other.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Get me some rope,’ said Mr Big in the doorway.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s all right, Solitaire,’ said Bond, knowing that it
wasn’t. ‘It’s all right. I’m here now.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He picked her up and held her at arm’s length. It
hurt his left arm. She was pale and dishevelled. There
was a bruise on her forehead and black circles under
her eyes. Her face was grimy and tears had made streaks
down the pale skin. She had no make-up. She wore a
dirty white linen suit and sandals. She looked thin.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What’s the bastard been doing to you?’ said Bond.
He suddenly held her tightly to him. She clung to him,
her face buried in his neck.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then she drew away and looked at her hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But you’re bleeding,’ she said. ‘What is it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She turned him half round and saw the black blood
on his shoulder and down his arm.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh my darling, what is it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She started to cry again, forlornly, hopelessly, realizing
suddenly that they were both lost.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Tie them up,’ said The Big Man from the door. ‘Here
under the light. I have things to say to them.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The negro came towards them and Bond turned. Was
it worth a gamble? The negro had nothing but rope in
his hands. But The Big Man had stepped sideways and
was watching him, the gun held loosely, half pointing
at the floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No, Mister Bond,’ he said simply.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond eyed the big negro and thought of Solitaire
and his own wounded arm.</p>

<p class="pindent">The negro came up and Bond allowed his arms to
be tied behind his back. They were good knots. There
was no play in them. They hurt.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled at Solitaire. He half closed one eye. It
was nothing but bravado, but he saw a hopeful awareness
dawn through her tears.</p>

<p class="pindent">The negro led him back to the doorway.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘There,’ said The Big Man, pointing at one of the
shackles.</p>

<p class="pindent">The negro cut Bond’s legs from under him with a
sudden sweep of his shin. Bond fell on his wounded
shoulder. The negro pulled him by the rope up to
the shackle, tested it, and put the rope through and then
down to Bond’s ankles which he bound securely. He
had stuck his dagger in a crevice in the rock. He pulled
it out and cut the rope and went back to where Solitaire
was standing.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was left sitting on the stone floor, his legs
straight out in front, his arms hoisted up and secured
behind him. Blood dripped down from his freshly
opened wound. Only the remains of the benzedrine in
his system kept him from fainting.</p>

<p class="pindent">Solitaire was bound and placed almost opposite him.
There was a yard between their feet.</p>

<p class="pindent">When it was done, The Big Man looked at his watch.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Go,’ he said to the guard. He closed the iron door
behind the man and leant against it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond and the girl looked at each other and The Big
Man gazed down on both of them.</p>

<p class="pindent">After one of his long silences he addressed Bond.
Bond looked up at him. The great grey football of a
head under the hurricane lamp looked like an elemental,
a malignant spectre from the centre of the earth, as it
hung in mid air, the golden eyes blazing steadily, the
great body in shadow. Bond had to remind himself that
he had heard its heart pumping in its chest, had heard
it breathe, had seen sweat on the grey skin. It was only
a man, of the same species as himself, a big man, with
a brilliant brain, but still a man who walked and defecated,
a mortal man with a diseased heart.</p>

<p class="pindent">The wide rubbery mouth split open and the flat,
slightly everted lips drew back from the big white
teeth.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You are the best of those that have been sent against
me,’ said Mr Big. His quiet flat voice was thoughtful,
measured. ‘And you have achieved the deaths of four
of my assistants. My followers find this incredible. It
was fully time that accounts should be squared. What
happened to the American was not sufficient. The
treachery of this girl,’ he still looked at Bond, ‘whom
I found in the gutter and whom I was prepared to put
on my right hand, has also brought my infallibility in
question. I was wondering how she should die, when
providence, or Baron Samedi as my followers will
believe, brought you also to the altar with your head
bowed ready for the axe.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The mouth paused, with the lips parted. Bond saw
the teeth come together to form the next word.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So it is convenient that you should die together. That
will happen, in an appropriate fashion,’ The Big Man
looked at his watch, ‘in two and a half hours’ time. At
six o’clock, give or take,’ he added, ‘a few minutes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Let’s give those minutes,’ said Bond. ‘I enjoy my
life.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘In the history of negro emancipation,’ Mr Big
continued in an easy conversational tone, ‘there have
already appeared great athletes, great musicians, great
writers, great doctors and scientists. In due course, as
in the developing history of other races, there will
appear negroes great and famous in every other walk
of life.’ He paused. ‘It is unfortunate for you, Mister
Bond, and for this girl, that you have encountered the
first of the great negro criminals. I use a vulgar word,
Mister Bond, because it is the one you, as a form of
policeman, would yourself use. But I prefer to regard
myself as one who has the ability and the mental and
nervous equipment to make his own laws and act
according to them rather than accept the laws that suit
the lowest common denominator of the people. You
have doubtless read Trotter’s <span class="it">Instincts of the Herd in War
and Peace</span>, Mister Bond. Well, I am by nature and predilection
a wolf and I live by a wolf’s laws. Naturally the
sheep describe such a person as a “criminal”.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The fact, Mister Bond,’ The Big Man continued after
a pause, ‘that I survive and indeed enjoy limitless success,
although I am alone against countless millions of sheep,
is attributable to the modern techniques I described to
you on the occasion of our last talk, and to an infinite
capacity for taking pains. Not dull, plodding pains, but
artistic, subtle pains. And I find, Mister Bond, that it is
not difficult to outwit sheep, however many of them
there may be, if one is dedicated to the task and if one
is by nature an extremely well-equipped wolf.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Let me illustrate to you, by an example, how my
mind works. We will take the method I have decided
upon by which you are both to die. It is a modern
variation on the method used in the time of my kind
patron, Sir Henry Morgan. In those days it was known
as “keel-hauling”.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Pray continue,’ said Bond, not looking at Solitaire.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We have a paravane on board the yacht,’ continued Mr
Big as if he were a surgeon describing a delicate operation
to a body of students, ‘which we use for trawling for
shark and other big fish. This paravane, as you know, is
a large buoyant torpedo-shaped device, which rides on
the end of a cable, away from the side of a ship, and
which can be used for sustaining the end of a net, and
drawing it through the water when the ship is in motion,
or if fitted with a cutting device, for severing the cables
of moored mines in time of war.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I intend,’ said Mr Big, in a matter-of-fact discursive
tone of voice, ‘to bind you together to a line streamed
from this paravane and to tow you through the sea until
you are eaten by sharks.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He paused, and his eyes looked from one to the other.
Solitaire was gazing wide-eyed at Bond and Bond was
thinking hard, his eyes blank and his mind boring into
the future. He felt he ought to say something.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You are a big man,’ he said, ‘and one day you will
die a big, horrible death. If you kill us, that death will
come soon. I have arranged for it. You are going mad
very fast or you would see what our murder will bring
down on you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Even as he spoke Bond’s mind was working fast,
counting hours and minutes, knowing that The Big
Man’s own death was creeping, with the acid in the fuse,
round the minute hand towards his personal hour of
final rendezvous. But would he and Solitaire be dead
before that hour struck? There would not be more than
minutes, perhaps seconds in it. The sweat poured off
his face on to his chest. He smiled across at Solitaire.
She looked back at him opaquely, her eyes not seeing
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly she gave an agonized cry that made Bond’s
nerves jerk.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I don’t know,’ she cried. ‘I can’t see. It’s so near, so
close. There is much death. But . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Solitaire,’ shouted Bond, terrified that whatever
strange things she saw in the future might give a warning
to The Big Man. ‘Pull yourself together.’</p>

<p class="pindent">There was an angry bite in his voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">Her eyes cleared. She looked dumbly at him, without
comprehension.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Big Man spoke again.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I am not going mad, Mister Bond,’ he said evenly,
‘and nothing you have arranged will affect me. You will
die beyond the reef and there will be no evidence. I
shall tow the remains of your bodies until there is
nothing left. That is part of the dexterity of my intentions.
You may also know that shark and barracuda play
a role in Voodooism. They will have their sacrifice and
Baron Samedi will be appeased. That will satisfy my
followers. I wish also to continue my experiments with
carnivorous fish. I believe they only attack when there
is blood in the water. So your bodies will be towed from
the island. The paravane will take them over the reef.
I believe you will not be harmed inside the reef. The
blood and offal that is thrown into these waters every
night will have dispersed or been consumed. But when
your bodies have been dragged over the reef, then I’m
afraid you will bleed, your bodies will be very raw. And
then we will see if my theories are correct.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Big Man put his hand behind him and pulled
the door open.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I will leave you now,’ he said, ‘to reflect on the excellence
of the method I have invented for your death
together. Two necessary deaths are achieved. No evidence
is left behind. Superstition is satisfied. My followers
pleased. The bodies are used for scientific research.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That is what I meant, Mister James Bond, by an
infinite capacity for taking artistic pains.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He stood in the doorway and looked at them.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A short, but very good night to you both.’</p>
