<p class="pindent">It was two o’clock in the morning. Bond eased his car
away from the sea-wall and moved off through the town
on to 4th Street, the highway to Tampa.</p>

<p class="pindent">He dawdled along down the four-lane concrete
highway through the endless gauntlet of motels, trailer
camps and roadside emporia selling beach furniture,
sea-shells and concrete gnomes.</p>

<p class="pindent">He stopped at the Gulf Winds Bar and Snacks and
ordered a double Old Granddad on the rocks. While
the barman poured it he went into the washroom and
cleaned himself up. The bandages on his left hand
were covered with dirt and the hand throbbed painfully.
The splint had broken on The Robber’s stomach.
There was nothing Bond could do about it. His eyes
were red with strain and lack of sleep. He went back
to the bar, drank down the bourbon and ordered
another one. The barman looked like a college kid
spending his holidays the hard way. He wanted to talk
but there was no talk left in Bond. Bond sat and
looked into his glass and thought about Leiter and
The Robber and heard the sickening grunt of the
feeding shark.</p>

<p class="pindent">He paid and went out and on again over the Gandy
Bridge, and the air of the Bay was cool on his face. At
the end of the bridge he turned left towards the airport
and stopped at the first motel that looked awake.</p>

<p class="pindent">The middle-aged couple that owned the place were
listening to late rhumba music from Cuba with a bottle
of rye between them. Bond told a story of a blow-out
on his way from Sarasota to Silver Springs. They weren’t
interested. They were just glad to take his ten dollars.
He drove his car up to the door of Room 5 and the
man unlocked the door and turned on the light. There
was a double bed and a shower and a chest-of-drawers
and two chairs. The motif was white and blue. It looked
clean and Bond put his bag down thankfully and said
good night. He stripped and threw his clothes unfolded
on to a chair. Then he took a quick shower, cleaned his
teeth and gargled with a sharp mouthwash and climbed
into bed.</p>

<p class="pindent">He plunged at once into a calm untroubled sleep. It
was the first night since he had arrived in America that
did not threaten a fresh battle with his stars on the
morrow.</p>

<p class="pindent">He awoke at midday and walked down the road to a
cafeteria where the short-order cook fixed him a delicious
three-decker western sandwich and coffee. Then
he came back to his room and wrote a detailed report
to the FBI at Tampa. He omitted all reference to the
gold in the poison tanks for fear that The Big Man
would close down his operations in Jamaica. The nature
of these had still to be discovered. Bond knew that the
damage he had done to the machine in America had
no bearing on the heart of his assignment—the
discovery of the source of the gold, its seizure, and the
destruction, if possible, of Mr Big himself.</p>

<p class="pindent">He drove to the airport and caught the silver, four-engined
plane with a few minutes to spare. He left
Leiter’s car in the parking space as in his report he had
told the FBI he would. He guessed that he need not
have mentioned it to the FBI when he saw a man in
an unnecessary raincoat hanging round the souvenir
shop, buying nothing. Raincoats seemed almost the
badge of office of the FBI. Bond was certain they
wanted to see he caught the plane. They would be glad
to see the last of him. Wherever he had gone in America
he had left dead bodies. Before he boarded the plane
he called the hospital in St Petersburg. He wished he
hadn’t; Leiter was still unconscious and there was no
news. Yes, they would cable him when they had something
definite.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was five in the evening when they circled over
Tampa Bay and headed east. The sun was low on the
horizon. A big jet from Pensacola swept by, well to
port, leaving four trails of vapour that hung almost
motionless in the still air. Soon it would complete its
training circuit and go in to land, back to the Gulf
Coast packed with oldsters in Truman shirts. Bond was
glad to be on his way to the soft green flanks of Jamaica
and to be leaving behind the great hard continent of
Eldollarado.</p>

<p class="pindent">The plane swept on across the waist of Florida, across
the acres of jungle and swamp without sign of human
habitation, its wing-lights blinking green and red in the
gathering dark. Soon they were over Miami and the
monster chump-traps of the Eastern Seaboard, their
arteries ablaze with neon. Away to port, State Highway
No. 1 disappeared up the coast in a golden ribbon of
motels, gas stations and fruit-juice stands, up through
Palm Beach and Daytona to Jacksonville, three hundred
miles away. Bond thought of the breakfast he had had
at Jacksonville not three days before and of all that had
happened since. Soon, after a short stop at Nassau, he
would be flying over Cuba, perhaps over the hideout
where Mr Big had put her away. She would hear the
noise of the plane and perhaps her instincts would make
her look up towards the sky and feel that for a moment
he was nearby.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond wondered if they would ever meet again and
finish what they had begun. But that would have to
come later, when his work was over—the prize at the
end of the dangerous road that had started three weeks
before in the fog of London.</p>

<p class="pindent">After a cocktail and an early dinner they came in to
Nassau and spent half an hour on the richest island in
the world, the sandy patch where a thousand million
pounds of frightened sterling lies buried beneath the
Canasta tables and where bungalows surrounded by a
thin scurf of screw-pine and casuarina change hands
at fifty thousand pounds a piece.</p>

<p class="pindent">They left the platinum whistle-stop behind and were
soon crossing the twinkling mother-of-pearl lights of
Havana, so different in their pastel modesty from the
harsh primary colours of American cities at night.</p>

<p class="pindent">They were flying at fifteen thousand feet when, just
after crossing Cuba, they ran into one of those violent
tropical storms that suddenly turn aircraft from comfortable
drawing-rooms into bucketing death-traps. The
great plane staggered and plunged, its screws now
roaring in vacuum and now biting harshly into walls of
solid air. The thin tube shuddered and swung. Crockery
crashed in the pantry and huge rain hammered on the
Perspex windows.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gripped the arms of his chair so that his left
hand hurt and cursed softly to himself.</p>

<p class="pindent">He looked at the racks of magazines and thought:
they won’t help much when the steel tires at fifteen
thousand feet, nor will the eau-de-cologne in the washroom,
nor the personalized meals, the free razor, the
‘orchid for your lady’ now trembling in the ice-box.
Least of all the safety-belts and the life-jackets with the
whistle that the steward demonstrates will really blow,
nor the cute little rescue-lamp that glows red.</p>

<p class="pindent">No, when the stresses are too great for the tired metal,
when the ground mechanic who checks the de-icing
equipment is crossed in love and skimps his job, way
back in London, Idlewild, Gander, Montreal; when
those or many things happen, then the little warm room
with propellers in front falls straight down out of the
sky into the sea or on to the land, heavier than air,
fallible, vain. And the forty little heavier-than-air people,
fallible within the plane’s fallibility, vain within its larger
vanity, fall down with it and make little holes in the land
or little splashes in the sea. Which is anyway their destiny,
so why worry? You are linked to the ground mechanic’s
careless fingers in Nassau just as you are linked to the
weak head of the little man in the family saloon who
mistakes the red light for the green and meets you
head-on, for the first and last time, as you are motoring
quietly home from some private sin. There’s nothing to
do about it. You start to die the moment you are born.
The whole of life is cutting through the pack with death.
So take it easy. Light a cigarette and be grateful you are
still alive as you suck the smoke deep into your lungs.
Your stars have already let you come quite a long way
since you left your mother’s womb and whimpered at
the cold air of the world. Perhaps they’ll even let you
get to Jamaica tonight. Can’t you hear those cheerful
voices in the control tower that have said quietly all day
long, ‘Come in BOAC. Come in Panam. Come in
KLM’? Can’t you hear them calling you down too:
‘Come in Transcarib. Come in Transcarib’? Don’t lose
faith in your stars. Remember that hot stitch of time
when you faced death from The Robber’s gun last night.
You’re still alive, aren’t you? There, we’re out of it
already. It was just to remind you that being quick with
a gun doesn’t mean you’re really tough. Just don’t forget
it. This happy landing at Palisadoes Airport comes to
you by courtesy of your stars. Better thank them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond unfastened his seat-belt and wiped the sweat
off his face.</p>

<p class="pindent">To hell with it, he thought, as he stepped down out
of the huge strong plane.</p>

<p class="pindent">Strangways, the chief Secret Service agent for the
Caribbean, was at the airport to meet him and he was
quickly through the Customs and Immigration and
Finance Control.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was nearly eleven and the night was quiet and hot.
There was the shrill sound of crickets from the dildo
cactus on both sides of the airport road and Bond
gratefully drank in the sounds and smells of the tropics
as the military pick-up cut across the corner of Kingston
and took them up towards the gleaming, moonlit foothills
of the Blue Mountains.</p>

<p class="pindent">They talked in monosyllables until they were settled
on the comfortable veranda of Strangways’s neat white
house on the Junction Road below Stony Hill.</p>

<p class="pindent">Strangways poured a strong whisky-and-soda for both
of them and then gave a concise account of the whole
of the Jamaica end of the case.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was a lean, humorous man of about thirty-five,
a former Lieutenant-Commander in the Special Branch
of the RNVR. He had a black patch over one eye and
the sort of aquiline good looks that are associated with
the bridges of destroyers. But his face was heavily lined
under its tan and Bond sensed from his quick gestures
and clipped sentences that he was nervous and highly
strung. He was certainly efficient and he had a sense
of humour, and he showed no signs of jealousy at
someone from headquarters butting in on his territory.
Bond felt that they would get on well together and he
looked forward to the partnership.</p>

<p class="pindent">This was the story that Strangways had to tell.</p>

<p class="pindent">It had always been rumoured that there was treasure
on the Isle of Surprise and everything that was known
about Bloody Morgan supported the rumour.</p>

<p class="pindent">The tiny island lay in the exact centre of Shark Bay,
a small harbour that lies at the end of the Junction
Road that runs across the thin waist of Jamaica from
Kingston to the north coast.</p>

<p class="pindent">The great buccaneer had made Shark Bay his headquarters.
He liked to have the whole width of the island
between himself and the Governor at Port Royal so
that he could slip in and out of Jamaican waters in
complete secrecy. The Governor also liked the arrangement.
The Crown wished a blind eye to be turned on
Morgan’s piracy until the Spaniards had been cleared
out of the Caribbean. When this was accomplished,
Morgan was rewarded with a Knighthood and the
Governorship of Jamaica. Till then, his actions had to
be disavowed to avoid a European war with Spain.</p>

<p class="pindent">So, for the long period before the poacher turned
gamekeeper, Morgan used Shark Bay as his sallyport.
He built three houses on the neighbouring estate, christened
Llanrumney after his birthplace in Wales. These
houses were called ‘Morgan’s’, ‘The Doctor’s’ and ‘The
Lady’s’. Buckles and coins are still turned up in the ruins
of them.</p>

<p class="pindent">His ships always anchored in Shark Bay and he careened
them in the lee of the Isle of Surprise, a precipitous
lump of coral and limestone that surges straight up out
of the centre of the bay and is surmounted by a jungly
plateau of about an acre.</p>

<p class="pindent">When, in 1683, he left Jamaica for the last time, it
was under open arrest to be tried by his peers for
flouting the Crown. His treasure was left behind somewhere
in Jamaica and he died in penury without revealing
its whereabouts. It must have been a vast hoard, the
fruits of countless raids on Hispaniola, of the capture
of innumerable treasure-ships sailing for The Plate, of
the sacking of Panama and the looting of Maracaibo.
But it vanished without trace.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was always thought that the secret lay somewhere
on the Isle of Surprise, but for two hundred years the
diving and digging of treasure-hunters yielded nothing.
Then, said Strangways, just six months before, two
things had happened within a few weeks. A young
fisherman disappeared from the village of Shark Bay,
and had not been heard of since, and an anonymous
New York syndicate purchased the island for a thousand
pounds from the present owner of the Llanrumney
Estate, which was now a rich banana and cattle property.</p>

<p class="pindent">A few weeks after the sale, the yacht <span class="it">Secatur</span> put in to
Shark Bay and dropped anchor in Morgan’s old
anchorage in the lee of the island. It was manned entirely
by negroes. They went to work and cut a stairway in
the rock face of the island and erected on the summit
a number of low-lying shacks in the fashion known in
Jamaica as ‘wattle-and-daub’.</p>

<p class="pindent">They appeared to be completely equipped with provisions,
and all they purchased from the fishermen of
the bay was fresh fruit and water.</p>

<p class="pindent">They were a taciturn and orderly lot who gave no
trouble. They explained to the Customs which they had
cleared in the neighbouring Port Maria that they were
there to catch tropical fish, especially the poisonous
varieties, and collect rare shells for Ourobouros Inc. in
St Petersburg. When they had established themselves
they purchased large quantities of these from the Shark
Bay, Port Maria and Oracabessa fishermen.</p>

<p class="pindent">For a week they carried out blasting operations on
the island and it was given out that these were for the
purpose of excavating a large fish-tank.</p>

<p class="pindent">The <span class="it">Secatur</span> began a fortnightly shuttle-service with
the Gulf of Mexico and watchers with binoculars
confirmed that, before each sailing, consignments of
portable fish-tanks were taken aboard. Always half a
dozen men were left behind. Canoes approaching the
island were warned off by a watchman at the base of
the steps in the cliff, who fished all day from a narrow
jetty alongside which the <span class="it">Secatur</span> on her visits moored
with two anchors out, well sheltered from the prevailing
north-easterly winds.</p>

<p class="pindent">No one succeeded in landing on the island by daylight
and, after two tragic attempts, nobody tried to gain
access by night.</p>

<p class="pindent">The first attempt was made by a local fisherman
spurred on by the rumours of buried treasure that no
talk of tropical fish could suppress. He had swum out
one dark night and his body had been washed back
over the reef next day. Sharks and barracuda had left
nothing but the trunk and the remains of a thigh.</p>

<p class="pindent">At about the time he should have reached the island
the whole village of Shark Bay was awakened by the
most horrible drumming noise. It seemed to come from
inside the island. It was recognized as the beating of
Voodoo drums. It started softly and rose slowly to a
thunderous crescendo. Then it died down again and
stopped. It lasted about five minutes.</p>

<p class="pindent">From that moment the island was ju-ju, or obeah, as
it is called in Jamaica, and even in daylight canoes kept
at a safe distance.</p>

<p class="pindent">By this time Strangways was interested and he made
a full report to London. Since 1950 Jamaica had become
an important strategic target, thanks to the development
by Reynolds Metal and the Kaiser Corporation of huge
bauxite deposits found on the island. So far as Strangways
was concerned, the activities on Surprise might
easily be the erection of a base for one-man submarines
in the event of war, particularly since Shark Bay was
within range of the route followed by the Reynolds
ships to the new bauxite harbour at Ocho Rios, a few
miles down the coast.</p>

<p class="pindent">London followed the report up with Washington and
it came to light that the New York syndicate that had
purchased the island was wholly owned by Mr Big.</p>

<p class="pindent">This was three months ago. Strangways was ordered
to penetrate the island at all costs and find out what
was going on. He mounted quite an operation. He
rented a property on the western arm of Shark Bay
called Beau Desert. It contained the ruins of one of
the famous Jamaican Great Houses of the early nineteenth
century and also a modern beach-house directly
across from the <span class="it">Secatur</span>’s anchorage up against
Surprise.</p>

<p class="pindent">He brought down two very fine swimmers from the
naval base at Bermuda and set up a permanent watch
on the island through day- and night-glasses. Nothing
of a suspicious nature was seen and on a dark calm
night he sent out the two swimmers with instructions
to make an underwater survey of the foundations of
the island.</p>

<p class="pindent">Strangways described his horror when, an hour after
they had left to swim across the three hundred yards
of water, the terrible drumming had started up somewhere
inside the cliffs of the island.</p>

<p class="pindent">That night the two men did not return.</p>

<p class="pindent">On the next day they were both washed up at different
parts of the bay. Or rather, the remains left by the shark
and barracuda.</p>

<p class="pindent">At this point in Strangways’s narrative, Bond interrupted
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Just a minute,’ he said. ‘What’s all this about shark
and barracuda? They’re not generally savage in these
waters. There aren’t very many of them round Jamaica
and they don’t often feed at night. Anyway, I don’t
believe either of them attack humans unless there’s
blood in the water. Occasionally they might snap at a
white foot out of curiosity. Have they ever behaved like
this round Jamaica before?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Never been a case since a girl got a foot bitten off
in Kingston Harbour in 1942,’ said Strangways. ‘She
was being towed by a speedboat, flipping her feet up
and down. The white feet must have looked particularly
appetizing. Travelling at just the right speed too.
Everyone agrees with your theory. And my men had
harpoons and knives. I thought I’d done everything to
protect them. Dreadful business. You can imagine how
I felt about it. Since then we’ve done nothing except
try to get legitimate access to the island via the Colonial
Office and Washington. You see, it belongs to an American
now. Damn slow business, particularly as there’s
nothing against these people. They seem to have pretty
good protection in Washington and some smart international
lawyers. We’re absolutely stuck. London told
me to hang on until you came.’ Strangways took a pull
at his whisky and looked expectantly at Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What are the <span class="it">Secatur</span>’s movements?’ asked Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Still in Cuba. Sailing in about a week, according to
the CIA.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How many trips has she done?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘About twenty.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond multiplied one hundred and fifty thousand dollars
by twenty. If his guess was right, Mr Big had already taken
a million pounds in gold out of the island.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ve made some provisional arrangements for you,’
said Strangways. ‘There’s the house at Beau Desert. I’ve
got you a car, Sunbeam Talbot coupé. New tyres. Fast.
Right car for these roads. I’ve got a good man to act
as your factotum. A Cayman Islander called Quarrel.
Best swimmer and fisherman in the Caribbean. Terribly
keen. Nice chap. And I’ve borrowed the West Indian
Citrus Company’s rest-house at Manatee Bay. It’s the
other end of the island. You could rest up there for a
week and get in a bit of training until the <span class="it">Secatur</span> comes
in. You’ll need to be fit if you’re going to try to get
over to Surprise, and I honestly believe that’s the only
answer. Anything else I can do? I’ll be about, of course,
but I’ll have to stay around Kingston to keep up communications
with London and Washington. They’ll want
to know everything we do. Anything else you’d like me
to fix up?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had been making up his mind.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ he said. ‘You might ask London to get the
Admiralty to lend us one of their frogmen suits complete
with compressed-air bottles. Plenty of spares. And a
couple of good underwater harpoon guns. The French
ones called Champion are the best. Good underwater
torch. A commando dagger. All the dope they can get
from the Natural History Museum on barracuda and
shark. And some of that shark-repellent stuff the Americans
used in the Pacific. Ask BOAC to fly it all out on
their direct service.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond paused. ‘Oh yes,’ he said. ‘And one of those
things our saboteurs used against ships in the war.
Limpet mine, with assorted fuses.’</p>
