<p class="calibre1">
James Bond lay in the
five-hundred-yard firing point of the famous Century
Range at Bisley.  The white peg in the grass beside
him said 44, and the same number was repeated high
up on the distant butt above the single six-feet-square
target that, to the human eye and in the late summer
dusk, looked no larger than a postage stamp.  But
through Bond's glass—an infrared sniperscope fixed
above his rifle—the lens covered the whole canvas.
He could even clearly distinguish the pale blue
and beige colors in which the target was divided,
and the six-inch semicircular bull's-eye looked as big
as the half-moon that was already beginning to show
low down in the darkening sky above the distant
crest of Chobham Ridges.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
James Bond's last shot had been an inner left.  Not
good enough.  He took another glance at the yellow
and blue wind flags.  They were streaming across
range from the east rather more stiffly than when he
had begun his shoot half an hour before, and he set
two clicks more to the right on the wind gauge and
traversed the cross-wires on the sniperscope back to
the point of aim.  Then he settled himself, put his
trigger finger gently inside the guard and onto the
curve of the trigger, shallowed his breathing, and
very, very softly squeezed.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The vicious crack of the shot boomed across the
empty range.  The target disappeared below ground,
and at once the dummy came up in its place.  Yes.
The black panel was in the bottom right-hand
corner this time, not in the bottom left.  A bull's-eye.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Good," said the voice of the chief range officer
from behind and above him.  "Stay with it."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The target was already up again, and Bond put his
cheek back to its warm patch on the chunky wooden
stock and his eye to the rubber eyepiece of the scope.
He wiped his gun hand down the side of his trousers
and took the pistol grip that jutted sharply down
below the trigger guard.  He splayed his legs an inch
more.  Now there were to be five rounds rapid.  It
would be interesting to see if that would produce
"fade."  He guessed not.  This extraordinary weapon
the armorer had somehow got his hands on gave one
the feeling that a standing man at a mile would be
easy meat.  It was mostly a .308-caliber International
Experimental Target rifle built by Winchester to
help American marksmen at World Championships,
and it had the usual gadgets of superaccurate target
weapons—a curled aluminum hand at the back of
the butt that extended under the armpit and held
the stock firmly into the shoulder, and an adjustable
pinion below the rifle's center of gravity to allow the
stock to be nailed into its grooved wooden rest.  The
armorer had had the usual single-shot bolt action
replaced by a five-shot magazine, and he had assured
Bond that if he allowed as little as two seconds
between shots to steady the weapon there would be no
fade even at five hundred yards.  For the job that
Bond had to do, he guessed that two seconds might
be a dangerous loss of time if he missed with his first
shot.  Anyway, M. had said that the range would be
not more than three hundred yards.  Bond would cut
it down to one second—almost continuous fire.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Ready?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Yes."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"I'll give you a countdown from five.  Now!  Five,
four, three, two, one.  Fire!"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The ground shuddered slightly and the air sang as
the five whirling scraps of cupronickel spat off into
the dusk.  The target went down and quickly rose
again, decorated with four small white discs closely
grouped on the bull's-eye.  There was no fifth disc—not
even a black one to show an inner or an outer.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"The last round was low," said the range officer
lowering his nightglasses.  "Thanks for the contribution.
We sift the sand on those butts at the end of
every year.  Never get less than fifteen tons of good
lead and copper scrap out of them.  Good money."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Bond had got to his feet.  Corporal Menzies from
the armorers' section appeared from the pavilion of
the Gun Club and knelt down to dismantle the
Winchester and its rest.  He looked up at Bond.  He
said with a hint of criticism, "You were taking it a
bit fast, sir.  Last round was bound to jump wide."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"I know, corporal.  I wanted to see how fast I could
take it.  I'm not blaming the weapon.  It's a hell of a
fine job.  Please tell the armorer so from me.  Now I'd
better get moving.  You're finding your own way
back to London, aren't you?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Yes.  Good night, sir."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The chief range officer handed Bond a record of
his shoot—two sighting shots and then ten rounds at
each hundred yards up to five hundred.  "Damned
good firing with this visibility.  You ought to come
back next year and have a bash at the Queen's Prize.
It's open to all comers nowadays—British Commonwealth,
that is."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Thanks.  Trouble is, I'm not all that much in
England.  And thanks for spotting for me."  Bond
glanced at the distant clock tower.  On either side,
the red danger flag and the red signal drum were
coming down to show that firing had ceased.  The
hands stood at nine-fifteen.  "I'd like to buy you a
drink, but I've got an appointment in London.  Can
we hold it over until that Queen's Prize you were
talking about?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The range officer nodded noncommittally.  He had
been looking forward to finding out more about this
man who had appeared out of the blue after a flurry
of signals from the Ministry of Defense and had then
proceeded to score well over ninety percent at all
distances.  And that after the range was closed for the
night and visibility was poor-to-bad.  And why had
he, who only officiated at the annual July meeting,
been ordered to be present?  And why had he been
told to see that Bond had a six-inch bull's-eye at five
hundred instead of the regulation fifteen-inch?  And
why this flummery with the danger flag and signal
drum that were only used on ceremonial occasions?
To put pressure on the man?  To give an edge of
urgency to the shoot?  Bond.  Commander James Bond.
The N.R.A. would surely have a record of anyone
who could shoot like that.  He'd remember to give
them a call.  Funny time to have an appointment in
London.  Probably a girl.  The range officer's
undistinguished face assumed a disgruntled expression.
Sort of fellow who got all the girls he wanted.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The two men walked through the handsome
façade of Club Row behind the range to Bond's car,
which stood opposite the bullet-pitted iron
reproduction of Landseer's famous Running Deer.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Nice-looking job," commented the range officer.
"Never seen a body like that on a Continental.  Have
it made specially?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Yes.  The Mark IVs are anyway really only
two-seaters.  And damned little luggage space.  So I got
Mulliner's to make it into a real two-seater with
plenty of trunk space.  Selfish car I'm afraid.  Well,
good night.  And thanks again."  The twin exhausts
boomed healthily, and the back wheels briefly spat
gravel.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The chief range officer watched the ruby lights
vanish up King's Avenue toward the London Road.
He turned on his heel and went to find Corporal
Menzies on a search for information that was to
prove fruitless.  The corporal remained as wooden as
the big mahogany box he was in the process of loading
into a khaki Land Rover without military symbols.
The range officer was a major.  He tried pulling
his rank without success.  The Land Rover
hammered away in Bond's wake.  The major walked
moodily off to the offices of the National Rifle
Association to try and find out what he wanted in the
library under "Bond, J."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
James Bond's appointment was not with a girl.  It
was with a B.E.A. flight to Hanover and Berlin.  As
he bit off the miles to London Airport, pushing the
big car hard so as to have plenty of time for a drink,
three drinks, before the takeoff, only part of his
mind was on the road.  The rest was reexamining, for
the umpteenth time, the sequence that was now
leading him to an appointment with an airplane.
But only an interim appointment.  His final rendezvous
on one of the next three nights in Berlin was
with a man.  He had to see this man and he had to be
sure to shoot him dead.
</p>

<p class="calibre1"><br class="calibre4"/></p>

<p class="calibre1">
When, at around two-thirty that afternoon, James
Bond had gone in through the double padded doors
and had sat down opposite the turned-away profile
on the other side of the big desk, he had sensed
trouble.  There was no greeting.  M.'s head was sunk into
his stiff turned-down collar in a Churchillian pose of
gloomy reflection, and there was a droop of bitterness
at the corner of his lips.  He swiveled his chair
around to face Bond, gave him an appraising glance
as if, Bond thought, to see that his tie was straight
and his hair properly brushed, and then began
speaking, fast, biting off his sentences as if he wanted
to be rid of what he was saying, and of Bond, as
quickly as possible.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Number 272.  He's a good man.  You won't have
come across him.  Simple reason that he's been holed
up in Novaya Zemlya since the war.  Now he's trying
to get out—loaded with stuff.  Atomic and rockets.
And their plan for a whole new series of tests.  For
nineteen sixty-one.  To put the heat on the West.
Something to do with Berlin.  Don't quite get the
picture, but the FO says if it's true it's terrific.  Makes
nonsense of the Geneva Conference and all this
blather about nuclear disarmament the Communist
bloc is putting out.  He's got as far as East Berlin.  But
he's got practically the whole of the KGB on his
tail—and the East German security forces of course.
He's holed up somewhere in East Berlin, and he got
one message over to us.  That he'd be coming across
between six and seven P.M. on one of the next three
nights—tomorrow, next day, or next day.  He gave
the crossing point.  Trouble is"—the downward
curve of M.'s lips became even more bitter—"the
courier he used was a double.  Station WB bowled
him out yesterday.  Quite by chance.  Had a lucky
break with one of the KGB codes.  The courier'll be
flown out for trial, of course.  But that won't help.
The KGB knows that 272 will be making a run for
it.  They know when.  They know where.  They know
just as much as we do—and no more.  Now, the code
we cracked was a one-day-only setting on their
machines.  But we got the whole of that day's traffic, and
that was good enough.  They plan to shoot him on
the run.  At this street crossing between East and
West Berlin he gave us in his message.  They're
mounting quite an operation—Operation Extase,
they call it.  Put their best sniper on the job.  All we
know about him is that his code name is the Russian
for Trigger.  Station WB guesses he's the same man
they've used before for sniper work.  Long-range stuff
across the frontier.  He's going to be guarding this
crossing every night, and his job is to get 272.  Of
course they'd obviously prefer to do a smoother job
with machine guns and what-have-you.  But it's quiet
in Berlin at the moment, and apparently the word is
it's got to stay so.  Anyway"—M. shrugged—"they've
got confidence in this Trigger operator, and that's
the way it's going to be!"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Where do I come in, sir?"  But James Bond had
guessed the answer, guessed why M. was showing his
dislike of the whole business.  This was going to be
dirty work, and Bond, because he belonged to the
Double-O Section, had been chosen for it.
Perversely, Bond wanted to force M. to put it in black
and white.  This was going to be bad news, dirty
news, and he didn't want to hear it from one of the
section officers, or even from the Chief of Staff.  This
was to be murder.  All right.  Let M. bloody well say
so.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Where do you come in, 007?"  M. looked coldly
across the desk.  "You know where you come in.
You've got to kill this sniper.  And you've got to kill
him before he gets 272.  That's all.  Is that
understood?"  The clear blue eyes remained cold as ice.  But
Bond knew that they remained so only with an effort
of will.  M. didn't like sending any man to a killing.
But, when it had to be done, he always put on this
fierce, cold act of command.  Bond knew why.  It was
to take some of the pressure, some of the guilt, off
the killer's shoulders.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
So now Bond, who knew these things, decided to
make it easy and quick for M.  He got to his feet.
"That's all right, sir.  I suppose the Chief of Staff
has got all the gen.  I'd better go and put in some
practice.  It wouldn't do to miss."  He walked to the
door.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
M. said quietly, "Sorry to have to hand this to
you.  Nasty job.  But it's got to be done well."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"I'll do my best, sir."  James Bond walked out
and closed the door behind him.  He didn't like the
job, but on the whole he'd rather have it himself
than have the responsibility of ordering someone
else to go and do it.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The Chief of Staff had been only a shade more
sympathetic.  "Sorry you've bought this one, James,"
he had said.  "But Tanqueray was definite that he
hadn't got anyone good enough on his station, and
this isn't the sort of job you can ask a regular soldier
to do.  Plenty of top marksmen in the B.A.O.R., but
a live target needs another kind of nerve.  Anyway,
I've been on to Bisley and fixed a shoot for you
tonight at eight-fifteen when the ranges will be closed.
Visibility should be about the same as you'll be
getting in Berlin around an hour earlier.  The armorer's
got the gun—a real target job—and he's sending it
down with one of his men.  You'll find your own way.
Then you're booked on a midnight B.E.A. charter
flight to Berlin.  Take a taxi to this address."  He
handed Bond a piece of paper.  "Go up to the fourth
floor, and you'll find Tanqueray's Number Two
waiting for you.  Then I'm afraid you'll just have to
sit it out for the next three days."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"How about the gun?  Am I supposed to take it
through the German customs in a golfbag or something?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The Chief of Staff hadn't been amused.  "It'll go
over in the FO pouch.  You'll have it by tomorrow
midday."  He had reached for a signal pad.  "Well,
you'd better get cracking.  I'll just let Tanqueray
know everything's fixed."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
James Bond glanced down at the dim blue face of
the dashboard clock.  Ten-fifteen.  With any luck, by
this time tomorrow it would all be finished.  After
all, it was the life of this man Trigger against the life
of 272.  It wasn't exactly murder.  Pretty near it,
though.  He gave a vicious blast on his triple wind
horns at an inoffensive family saloon, took the
roundabout in a quite unnecessary dry skid,
wrenched the wheel harshly to correct it, and
pointed the nose of the Bentley toward the distant
glow that was London Airport.
</p>

<p class="calibre1"><br class="calibre4"/></p>

<p class="calibre1">
The ugly six-story building at the corner of the
Kochstrasse and the Wilhelmstrasse was the only one
standing in a waste of empty bombed space.  Bond
paid off his taxi and got a brief impression of the
neighborhood—waist-high weeds and half-tidied
rubble walls stretching away to a big deserted crossroads
lit by a central cluster of yellowish arc lamps—before
he pushed the bell for the fourth floor and at
once heard the click of the door opener.  The door
closed itself behind him, and he walked over the
uncarpeted cement floor to the old-fashioned lift.  The
smell of cabbage, cheap cigar smoke, and stale sweat
reminded him of other apartment houses in Germany
and Central Europe.  Even the sigh and faint
squeal of the slow lift were part of a hundred assignments
when he had been fired off by M., like a projectile,
at some distant target where a problem waited
for his coming, waited to be solved by him.  At least
this time the reception committee was on his side.
This time there was nothing to fear at the top of the
stairs.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Number Two of Secret Service Station WB was a
lean, tense man in his early forties.  He wore the
uniform of his profession—well-cut, well-used,
light-weight tweeds in a dark green herringbone, a soft
white silk shirt, and an old school tie (in his case
Wykehamist).  At the sight of the tie, and while they
exchanged conventional greetings in the small musty
lobby of the apartment, Bond's spirits, already low,
sank another degree.  He knew the type—backbone
of the civil service ... overcrammed and
underloved at Winchester ... a good second in P.P.E. at
Oxford ... the war, staff jobs he would have done
meticulously—perhaps an O.B.E. ... Allied
Control Commission in Germany where he had been
recruited into the I Branch....  And thence—because
he was the ideal staff man and A-one with
Security, and because he thought he would find life,
drama, romance—the things he had never had—into
the Secret Service.  A sober, careful man had been
needed to chaperone Bond on this ugly business.
Captain Paul Sender, late of the Welsh Guards, had
been the obvious choice.  He had bought it.  Now,
like a good Wykehamist, he concealed his distaste for
the job beneath careful, trite conversation as he
showed Bond the layout of the apartment and the
arrangements that had been made for the executioner's
preparedness and, to a modest extent, his comfort.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The flat consisted of a large double bedroom, a
bathroom, and a kitchen containing tinned food,
milk, butter, eggs, bread, and one bottle of Dimple
Haig.  The only odd feature in the bedroom was that
one of the double beds was angled up against the
curtains covering the single broad window and was
piled high with three mattresses below the bed-clothes.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Captain Sender said, "Care to have a look at the
field of fire?  Then I can explain what the other side
has in mind."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Bond was tired.  He didn't particularly want to go
to sleep with the picture of the battlefield on his
mind.  But he said, "That'd be fine."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Captain Sender switched off the lights.  Chinks
from the streetlight at the intersection showed
round the curtains.  "Don't want to draw the
curtains," said Captain Sender.  "Unlikely, but they may
be on the lookout for a covering party for 272.  If
you'd just lie on the bed and get your head under
the curtains, I'll brief you about what you'll be
looking at.  Look to the left."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
It was a sash window, and the bottom half was
open.  The mattresses, by design, gave only a little,
and James Bond found himself more or less in the
firing position he had been in on the Century
Range.  But now he was staring across broken,
thickly weeded bombed ground toward the bright
river of the Zimmerstrasse—the border with East
Berlin.  It looked about a hundred and fifty yards
away.  Captain Sender's voice from above him and
behind the curtain began reciting.  It reminded
Bond of a spiritualist séance.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"That's bombed ground in front of you.  Plenty of
cover.  A hundred and thirty yards of it up to the
frontier.  Then the frontier—the street—and then a
big stretch of more bombed ground on the enemy
side.  That's why 272 chose this route.  It's one of the
few places in the town which is broken land—thick
weeds, ruined walls, cellars—on both sides of the
frontier....  272 will sneak through that mess on
the other side, and make a dash across the Zimmerstrasse
for the mess on our side.  Trouble is, he'll
have thirty yards of brightly lit frontier to sprint
across.  That'll be the killing ground.  Right?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Bond said, "Yes."  He said it softly.  The scent of
the enemy, the need to take care, already had him by
the nerves.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"To your left, that big new ten-story block is the
Haus der Ministerien, the chief brain center of East
Berlin.  You can see the lights are still on in most of
the windows.  Most of those will stay on all night.
These chaps work hard—shifts all round the clock.
You probably won't need to worry about the lighted
ones.  This Trigger chap will almost certainly fire
from one of the dark windows.  You'll see there's a
block of four together on the corner above the
intersection.  They've stayed dark last night and tonight.
They've got the best field of fire.  From here, their
range varies from three hundred to three hundred
and ten yards.  I've got all the figures and so on when
you want them.  You needn't worry about much else.
That street stays empty during the night—only the
motorized patrols about every half an hour.  Light
armored car with a couple of motorcycles as escort.
Last night, which I suppose is typical, between six
and seven when this thing's going to be done, there
were a few people that came and went out of that
side door.  Civil-servant types.  Before that nothing
out of the ordinary—usual flow of people in and out
of a busy government building, except, of all things,
a whole damned woman's orchestra.  Made a hell of a
racket in some concert hall they've got in there.  Part
of the block is the Ministry of Culture.  Otherwise
nothing—certainly none of the KGB people we
know, or any signs of preparation for a job like this.
But there wouldn't be.  They're careful chaps, the
opposition.  Anyway, have a good look.  Don't forget
it's darker than it will be tomorrow around six.  But
you can get the general picture."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Bond got the general picture, and it stayed with
him long after the other man was asleep and snoring
softly with a gentle regular clicking sound.  A
Wykehamist snore, Bond reflected irritably.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Yes, he had got the picture.  The picture of a
flicker of movement among the shadowy ruins on the
other side of the gleaming river of light, a pause, the
wild zigzagging sprint of a man in the full glare of
the arcs, the crash of gunfire—and then either a
crumpled, sprawling heap in the middle of the wide
street or the noise of his onward dash through the
weeds and rubble of the Western Sector.  Sudden
death or a home run.  The true gauntlet!  How much
time would Bond have to spot the Russian sniper in
one of those dark windows?  And kill him?  Five
seconds?  Ten?  When dawn edged the curtains with gun
metal, Bond capitulated to his fretting mind.  It had
won.  He went softly into the bathroom and surveyed
the ranks of medicine bottles that a thoughtful
Secret Service had provided to keep its executioner in
good shape.  He selected the Tuinal, chased down
two of the ruby and blue depth-charges with a glass
of water, and went back to bed.  Then, poleaxed, he
slept.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
He awoke at midday.  The flat was empty.  Bond
drew the curtains to let in the gray Prussian day,
and, standing well back from the window, gazed out
at the drabness of Berlin, and listened to the tram
noises and to the distant screeching of the U-Bahn as
it took the big curve into the Zoo Station.  He gave a
quick, reluctant glance at what he had examined the
night before, noted that the weeds among the bomb
rubble were much the same as the London ones—campion,
dock, and bracken—and then went into
the kitchen.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
There was a note propped against a loaf of bread:
"My friend [a Secret Service euphemism that in this
context meant Sender's chief] says it's all right for
you to go out.  But to be back by 1700 hours.  Your
gear [doubletalk for Bond's rifle] has arrived and
the batman will lay it out this P.M.  P. Sender."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Bond lit the gas cooker, and with a sneer at his
profession, burned the message.  Then he brewed
himself a vast dish of scrambled eggs and bacon,
which he heaped on buttered toast and washed down
with black coffee into which he had poured a liberal
tot of whiskey.  Then he bathed and shaved, dressed
in the drab, anonymous, middle-European clothes
he had brought over for the purpose, looked at his
disordered bed, decided to hell with it, and went
down in the lift and out of the building.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
James Bond had always found Berlin a glum,
inimical city, varnished on the Western side with a
brittle veneer of gimcrack polish rather like the
chromium trim on American motorcars.  He walked
to the Kurfürstendamm and sat in the Café
Marquardt and drank an espresso and moodily watched
the obedient queues of pedestrians waiting for the
Go sign on the traffic lights while the shiny stream of
cars went through their dangerous quadrille at the
busy intersection.  It was cold outside and the sharp
wind from the Russian steppes whipped at the girls'
skirts and at the waterproofs of the impatient
hurrying men, each with the inevitable briefcase tucked
under his arm.  The infrared wall heaters in the café
glared redly down and gave a spurious glow to the
faces of the café squatters, consuming their
traditional "one cup of coffee and ten glasses of water,"
reading the free newspapers and periodicals in their
wooden racks, earnestly bending over business
documents.  Bond, closing his mind to the evening,
debated with himself about ways to spend the
afternoon.  It finally came down to a choice between a
visit to that respectable-looking brownstone house in
the Clausewitzstrasse known to all concierges and
taxi drivers and a trip to the Wannsee and a
strenuous walk in the Grunewald.  Virtue triumphed.  Bond
paid for his coffee and went out into the cold and
took a taxi to the Zoo Station.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The pretty young trees round the long lake had
already been touched by the breath of autumn, and
there was occasional gold amongst the green.  Bond
walked hard for two hours along the leafy paths,
then chose a restaurant with a glassed-in veranda
above the lake and greatly enjoyed a high tea
consisting of a double portion of <i class="calibre3">Matjeshering</i>,
smothered in cream and onion rings, and two <i class="calibre3">Molle mit
Korn</i>.  (This Berlin equivalent of a boilermaker
and his assistant was a schnapps, double, washed
down with draught Löwenbräu.)  Then, feeling
more encouraged, he took the S-Bahn back into
the city.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Outside the apartment house, a nondescript
young man was tinkering with the engine of a black
Opel Kapitan.  He didn't take his head out from
under the bonnet when Bond passed close by him and
went up to the door and pressed the bell.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Captain Sender was reassuring.  It was a "friend"—a
corporal from the transport section of Station
WB.  He had fixed up some bad engine trouble on
the Opel.  Each night, from six to seven, he would be
ready to produce a series of multiple backfires when
a signal on a walkie-talkie operated by Sender told
him to do so.  This would give some kind of cover for
the noise of Bond's shooting.  Otherwise, the
neighborhood might alert the police and there would be a
lot of untidy explaining to be done.  Their hideout
was in the American Sector, and while their
American "friends" had given Station WB clearance for
this operation, the "friends" were naturally anxious
that it should be a clean job and without repercussions.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Bond was suitably impressed by the car gimmick,
as he was by the very workmanlike preparations that
had been made for him in the living room.  Here,
behind the head of his high bed, giving a perfect
firing position, a wood and metal stand had been
erected against the broad windowsill, and along it
lay the Winchester, the tip of its barrel just denting
the curtains.  The wood and all the metal parts of the
rifle and sniperscope had been painted a dull black,
and, laid out on the bed like sinister evening clothes,
was a black velvet hood stitched to a waist-length
shirt of the same material.  The hood had wide slits
for the eyes and mouth.  It reminded Bond of old
prints of the Spanish Inquisition or of the
anonymous operators on the guillotine platform during
the French Revolution.  There was a similar hood on
Captain Sender's bed, and on his section of the
windowsill there lay a pair of nightglasses and the
microphone for the walkie-talkie.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Captain Sender, his face worried and tense with
nerves, said there was no news at the Station, no
change in the situation as they knew it.  Did Bond
want anything to eat?  Or a cup of tea?  Perhaps a
tranquilizer—there were several kinds in the bathroom?
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Bond stitched a cheerful, relaxed expression on
his face and said no thanks, and gave a lighthearted
account of his day while an artery near his solar
plexus began thumping gently as tension built up
inside him like a watchspring tightening.  Finally his
small talk petered out and he lay down on his bed
with a German thriller he had bought on his
wanderings, while Captain Sender moved fretfully about
the flat, looking too often at his watch and chain-smoking
Kent filter-tips through (he was a careful
man) a Dunhill filtered cigarette holder.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
James Bond's choice of reading matter, prompted
by a spectacular jacket of a half-naked girl strapped
to a bed, turned out to have been a happy one for
the occasion.  It was called <i class="calibre3">Verderbt, Verdammt,
Verraten</i>.  The prefix <i class="calibre3">ver</i> signified that the girl had
not only been ruined, damned, and betrayed, but
that she had suffered these misfortunes most
thoroughly.  James Bond temporarily lost himself in the
tribulations of the heroine, Gräfin Liselotte
Mutzenbacher, and it was with irritation that he heard
Captain Sender say that it was five-thirty and time to
take up their positions.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Bond took off his coat and tie, put two sticks of
chewing gum in his mouth, and donned the hood.
The lights were switched off by Captain Sender, and
Bond lay along the bed, got his eye to the eyepiece of
the sniperscope, and gently lifted the bottom edge
of the curtain back and over his shoulders.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Now dusk was approaching, but otherwise the
scene (a year later to become famous as Checkpoint
Charlie) was like a well-remembered photograph—the
wasteland in front of him, the bright river of the
frontier road, the further wasteland, and, on the left,
the ugly square block of the Haus der Ministerien
with its lit and dark windows.  Bond scanned it all
slowly, moving the sniperscope, with the rifle, by
means of the precision screws on the wooden base.  It
was all the same except that now there was a trickle
of personnel leaving and entering the Haus der
Ministerien through the door onto the Wilhelmstrasse.
Bond looked long at the four dark windows—dark
again tonight—that he agreed with Sender were the
enemy's firing points.  The curtains were drawn
back, and the sash windows were wide open at the
bottom.  Bond's scope could not penetrate into the
rooms, but there was no sign of movement within
the four oblong black gaping mouths.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Now there was extra traffic in the street below the
windows.  The woman's orchestra came trooping
down the pavement toward the entrance.  Twenty
laughing, talking girls carrying their instruments—violin
and wind instrument cases, satchels with their
scores—and four of them with the drums.  A gay,
happy little crocodile.  Bond was reflecting that some
people still seemed to find life fun in the Soviet
Sector, when his glasses picked out and stayed on the
girl carrying the cello.  Bond's masticating jaws
stopped still, and then reflectively went on with
their chewing as he twisted the screw to depress the
sniperscope and keep her in its center.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The girl was taller than the others, and her long,
straight, fair hair, falling to her shoulders, shone like
molten gold under the arcs at the intersection.  She
was hurrying along in a charming, excited way,
carrying the cello case as if it were no heavier than a
violin.  Everything was flying—the skirt of her coat,
her feet, her hair.  She was vivid with movement and
life and, it seemed, with gaiety and happiness as she
chattered to the two girls who flanked her and
laughed back at what she was saying.  As she turned
in at the entrance amidst her troupe, the arcs
momentarily caught a beautiful, pale profile.  And then
she was gone, and, it seemed to Bond, that with her
disappearance, a stab of grief lanced into his heart.
How odd!  How very odd!  This had not happened to
him since he was young.  And now this single girl,
seen only indistinctly and far away, had caused him
to suffer this sharp pang of longing, this thrill of
animal magnetism!  Morosely, Bond glanced down at
the luminous dial of his watch.  Five-fifty.  Only ten
minutes to go.  No transport arriving at the entrance.
None of those anonymous black ZiL saloons he had
half-expected.  He closed as much of his mind as he
could to the girl and sharpened his wits.  Get on,
damn you!  Get back to your job!
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
From somewhere inside the Haus der Ministerien
there came the familiar sounds of an orchestra
tuning up—the strings tuning their instruments to
single notes on the piano, the sharp blare of
individual woodwinds—then a pause, and then the
collective crash of melody as the whole orchestra threw
itself competently, so far as Bond could judge, into the
opening bars of what even to James Bond was
vaguely familiar.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Moussorgsky's Overture to <i class="calibre3">Boris Godunov</i>," said
Captain Sender succinctly.  "Anyway, six o'clock
coming up."  And then, urgently, "Hey!  Right-hand
bottom of the four windows!  Watch out!"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Bond depressed the sniperscope.  Yes, there was
movement inside the black cave.  Now, from the
interior, a thick black object, a weapon, had slid out.  It
moved firmly, minutely, swiveling down and sideways
so as to cover the stretch of the Zimmerstrasse
between the two wastelands of rubble.  Then the
unseen operator in the room behind seemed satisfied,
and the weapon remained still, fixed obviously to
such a stand as Bond had beneath his rifle.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"What is it?  What sort of gun?"  Captain Sender's
voice was more breathless than it should have been.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Take it easy, dammit! thought Bond.  It's me who's
supposed to have the nerves.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
He strained his eyes, taking in the squat flash
eliminator at the muzzle, the telescopic sight, and
the thick downward chunk of magazine.  Yes, that
would be it!  Absolutely for sure—and the best they
had!
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Kalashnikov," he said curtly.  "Submachinegun.
Gas-operated.  Thirty rounds in seven sixty-two
millimeter.  Favorite with the KGB.  They're going to do a
saturation job after all.  Perfect for range.  We'll have
to get him pretty quick, or 272 will end up not just
dead but strawberry jam.  You keep an eye out for
any movement over there in the rubble.  I'll have to
stay married to that window and the gun.  He'll have
to show himself to fire.  Other chaps are probably
spotting behind him—perhaps from all four
windows.  Much the sort of setup we expected, but I
didn't think they'd use a weapon that's going to
make all the racket this one will.  Should have known
they would.  A running man will be hard to get in
this light with a single-shot job."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Bond fiddled minutely with the traversing and
elevating screws at his fingertips and got the fine
lines of the scope exactly intersected, just behind
where the butt of the enemy gun merged into the
blackness behind.  Get the chest—don't bother about
the head!
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Inside the hood, Bond's face began to sweat and
his eye socket was slippery against the rubber of the
eyepiece.  That didn't matter.  It was only his hands,
his trigger finger, that must stay bone dry.  As the
minutes ticked by, he frequently blinked his eyes to
rest them, shifted his limbs to keep them supple,
listened to the music to relax his mind.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The minutes slouched on leaden feet.  How old
would she be?  Early twenties?  Say twenty-three?
With that poise and insouciance, the hint of authority
in her long easy stride, she would come of good
racy stock—one of the old Prussian families probably
or from similar remnants in Poland or even Russia.
Why in hell did she have to choose the cello?
There was something almost indecent in the idea of
this bulbous, ungainly instrument between her
splayed thighs.  Of course Suggia had managed to
look elegant, and so did that girl Amaryllis
somebody.  But they should invent a way for women to
play the damned thing sidesaddle.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
From his side Captain Sender said, "Seven o'clock.
Nothing's stirred on the other side.  Bit of movement
on our side, near a cellar close to the frontier.
That'll be our reception committee—two good men
from the Station.  Better stay with it until they close
down.  Let me know when they take that gun in."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"All right."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
It was seven-thirty when the KGB submachinegun
was gently drawn back into the black interior.  One
by one the bottom sashes of the four windows were
closed.  The coldhearted game was over for the night.
272 was still holed up.  Two more nights to go!
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Bond softly drew the curtain over his shoulders
and across the muzzle of the Winchester.  He got up,
pulled off his cowl, and went into the bathroom,
where he stripped and had a shower.  Then he had
two large whiskeys-on-the-rocks in quick succession,
while he waited, his ears pricked, for the now
muffled sound of the orchestra to stop.  At eight
o'clock it did, with the expert comment from
Sender—"Borodin's <i class="calibre3">Prince Igor</i>, Choral Dance Number
17, I think."—who had been getting off his report in
garbled language to the Head of Station.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Just going to have another look.  I've rather taken
to that tall blonde with the cello," Bond said to
Sender.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Didn't notice her," said Sender, uninterested.  He
went into the kitchen.  Tea, guessed Bond.  Or
perhaps Horlick's.  Bond donned his cowl, went back to
his firing position, and depressed the sniperscope to
the doorway of the Haus der Ministerien.  Yes, there
they went, not so gay and laughing now.  Tired
perhaps.  And now here she came, less lively, but still
with that beautiful careless stride.  Bond watched the
blown golden hair and the fawn raincoat until it had
vanished into the indigo dusk up the Wilhelmstrasse.
Where did she live?  In some miserable flaked room
in the suburbs?  Or in one of the privileged
apartments in the hideous lavatory-tiled Stalinallee?
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Bond drew himself back.  Somewhere, within easy
reach, that girl lived.  Was she married?  Did she have
a lover?  Anyway, to hell with it!  She was not for him.
</p>

<p class="calibre1"><br class="calibre4"/></p>

<p class="calibre1">
The next day, and the next night watch, were
duplicates, with small variations, of the first.  James
Bond had his two more brief rendezvous, by sniperscope,
with the girl, and the rest was a killing of time
and a tightening of the tension that, by the time the
third and final day came, was like a fog in the small
room.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
James Bond crammed the third day with an almost
lunatic program of museums, art galleries, the
zoo, and a film, hardly perceiving anything he
looked at, his mind's eye divided between the girl
and those four black squares and the black tube and
the unknown man behind it—the man he was now
certainly going to kill tonight.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Back punctually at five in the apartment, Bond
narrowly averted a row with Captain Sender because,
that evening, Bond took a stiff drink of the
whiskey before he donned the hideous cowl that now
stank of his sweat.  Captain Sender had tried to
prevent him, and when he failed, had threatened to call
up Head of Station and report Bond for breaking
training.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Look, my friend," said Bond wearily, "I've got to
commit a murder tonight.  Not you.  Me.  So be a good
chap and stuff it, would you?  You can tell
Tanqueray anything you like when it's over.  Think I
like this job?  Having a Double-O number and so on?
I'd be quite happy for you to get me sacked from the
Double-O Section.  Then I could settle down and
make a snug nest of papers as an ordinary staffer.
Right?"  Bond drank down his whiskey, reached for
his thriller—now arriving at an appalling
climax—and threw himself on the bed.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Captain Sender, icily silent, went off into the
kitchen to brew, from the sounds, his inevitable
cuppa.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Bond felt the whiskey beginning to melt the
coiled nerves in his stomach.  Now then, Liselotte,
how in hell are you going to get out of this fix?
</p>

<p class="calibre1"><br class="calibre4"/></p>

<p class="calibre1">
It was exactly six-five when Sender, at his post,
began talking excitedly.  "Bond, there's something
moving way back over there.  Now he's stopped—wait,
no, he's on the move again, keeping low.
There's a bit of broken wall there.  He'll be out of
sight of the opposition.  But thick weeds, yards of
them, ahead of him.  Christ!  He's coming through
the weeds.  And they're moving.  Hope to God they
think it's only the wind.  Now he's through and gone
to ground.  Any reaction?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"No," said Bond tensely.  "Keep on telling me.
How far to the frontier?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"He's only got about fifty yards to go," Captain
Sender's voice was harsh with excitement.  "Broken
stuff, but some of it's open.  Then a solid chunk of
wall right up against the pavement.  He'll have to get
over it.  They can't fail to spot him then.  Now!  Now
he's made ten yards, and another ten.  Got him
clearly then.  Blackened his face and hands.  Get
ready!  Any moment now he'll make the last sprint."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
James Bond felt the sweat pouring down his face
and neck.  He took a chance and quickly wiped his
hands down his sides and then got them back to the
rifle, his finger inside the guard, just lying along
the curved trigger.  "There's something moving in
the room behind the gun.  They must have spotted
him.  Get that Opel working."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Bond heard the code word go into the microphone,
heard the Opel in the street below start up,
felt his pulse quicken as the engine leaped into life
and a series of ear-splitting cracks came from the
exhaust.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The movement in the black cave was now definite.
A black arm with a black glove had reached out and
under the stock.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Now!" called out Captain Sender.  "Now!  He's
run for the wall!  He's up it!  Just going to jump!"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
And then, in the sniperscope, Bond saw the head
of Trigger—the purity of the profile, the golden bell
of hair—all laid out along the stock of the Kalashnikov!
She was dead, a sitting duck!  Bond's fingers
flashed down to the screws, inched them round, and
as yellow flame fluttered at the snout of the
submachinegun, squeezed the trigger.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The bullet, dead-on at three hundred and ten
yards, must have hit where the stock ended up the
barrel, might have got her in the left hand—but the
effect was to tear the gun off its mountings, smash it
against the side of the window frame, and then hurl
it out of the window.  It turned several times on its
way down and crashed into the middle of the street.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"He's over!" shouted Captain Sender.  "He's over!
He's done it!  My God, he's done it!"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Get down!" said Bond sharply, and threw himself
sideways off the bed as the big eye of a searchlight
in one of the black windows blazed on,
swerving up the street toward their block and their room.
Then gunfire crashed, and the bullets howled into
their window, ripping the curtains, smashing the
woodwork, thudding into the walls.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Behind the roar and zing of the bullets, Bond
heard the Opel race off down the street, and, behind
that again, the fragmentary whisper of the orchestra.
The combination of the two background noises
clicked.  Of course!  The orchestra, that must have
raised an infernal din throughout the offices and
corridors of the Haus der Ministerien, was, as on their
side the backfiring Opel, designed to provide some
cover for the sharp burst of fire from Trigger.  Had
she carried her weapon to and fro every day in that
cello case?  Was the whole orchestra composed of
KGB women?  Had the other instrument cases
contained only equipment—the big drum perhaps the
searchlight—while the real instruments were
available in the concert hall?  Too elaborate?  Too
fantastic?  Probably.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
But there had been no doubt about the girl.  In
the sniperscope, Bond had even been able to see one
wide, heavily lashed, aiming eye.  Had he hurt her?
Almost certainly her left arm.  There would be no
chance of seeing her, seeing how she was, if she left
with the orchestra.  Now he would never see her
again.  Bond's window would be a death trap.  To
underline the fact, a stray bullet smashed into the
mechanism of the Winchester, already overturned
and damaged, and hot lead splashed down on Bond's
hand, burning the skin.  On Bond's emphatic oath,
the firing stopped abruptly and silence sang in the
room.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Captain Sender emerged from beside his bed,
brushing glass out of his hair.  Bond and Sender
crunched across the floor and through the splintered
door into the kitchen.  Here, because the room faced
away from the street, it was safe to switch on the
light.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Any damage?" asked Bond.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"No.  You all right?"  Captain Sender's pale eyes
were bright with the fever that comes in battle.
They also, Bond noticed, held a sharp glint of
accusation.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Yes.  Just get an Elastoplast for my hand.  Caught
a splash from one of the bullets."  Bond went into the
bathroom.  When he came out, Captain Sender was
sitting by the walkie-talkie he had fetched from the
sitting room.  He was speaking into it.  Now he said
into the microphone, "That's all for now.  Fine
about 272.  Hurry the armored car, if you would.  Be
glad to get out of here, and 007 will need to write his
version of what happened.  Okay?  Then over and out."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Captain Sender turned to Bond.  Half accusing,
half embarrassed he said, "Afraid Head of Station
needs your reasons in writing for not getting that
chap.  I had to tell him I'd seen you alter your aim at
the last second.  Gave Trigger time to get off a burst.
Damned lucky for 272 he'd just begun his sprint.
Blew chunks off the wall behind him.  What was it all
about?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
James Bond knew he could lie, knew he could
fake a dozen reasons why.  Instead he took a deep
pull at the strong whiskey he had poured for himself,
put the glass down, and looked Captain Sender
straight in the eye.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Trigger was a woman."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"So what?  KGB has got plenty of women agents—and
women gunners.  I'm not in the least surprised.
The Russian woman's team always does well in the
World Championships.  Last meeting, in Moscow,
they came first, second, and third against seventeen
countries.  I can even remember two of their
names—Donskaya and Lomova.  Terrific shots.  She may
even have been one of them.  What did she look like?
Records'll probably be able to turn her up."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"She was a blonde.  She was the girl who carried
the cello in that orchestra.  Probably had her gun in
the cello case.  The orchestra was to cover up the
shooting."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Oh!" said Captain Sender slowly.  "I see.  The girl
you were keen on?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"That's right."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Well, I'm sorry, but I'll have to put that in my
report too.  You had clear orders to exterminate
Trigger."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
There came the sound of a car approaching.  It
pulled up somewhere below.  The bell rang twice.
Sender said, "Well, let's get going.  They've sent an
armored car to get us out of here."  He paused.  His
eyes flicked over Bond's shoulder, avoiding Bond's
eyes.  "Sorry about the report.  Got to do my duty,
y'know.  You should have killed that sniper whoever
it was."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Bond got up.  He suddenly didn't want to leave
the stinking little smashed-up flat, leave the place
from which, for three days, he had had this
long-range, one-sided romance with an unknown
girl—an unknown enemy agent with much the same job
in her outfit as he had in his.  Poor little bitch!  She
would be in worse trouble now than he was!  She'd
certainly be court-martialed for muffing this job.
Probably be kicked out of the KGB.  He shrugged.
At least they'd stop short of killing her—as he
himself had done.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
James Bond said wearily, "Okay.  With any luck
it'll cost me my Double-O number.  But tell Head of
Station not to worry.  That girl won't do any more
sniping.  Probably lost her left hand.  Certainly broke
her nerve for that kind of work.  Scared the living
daylights out of her.  In my book, that was enough.
Let's go."
