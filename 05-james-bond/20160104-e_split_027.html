<p class="pindent">The train howled on through the night. Bond sat and
watched the hurrying moonlit landscape and concentrated
on keeping awake.</p>

<p class="pindent">Everything conspired to make him sleep—the hasty
metal gallop of the wheels, the hypnotic swoop of the
silver telegraph wires, the occasional melancholy, reassuring
moan of the steam whistle clearing their way, the drowsy
metallic clatter of the couplings at each end of the
corridor, the lullaby creak of the woodwork in the little
room. Even the deep violet glimmer of the nightlight
above the door seemed to say, ‘I will watch for you.
Nothing can happen while I am burning. Close your
eyes and sleep, sleep.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl’s head was warm and heavy on his lap. There
was so obviously just room for him to slip under the
single sheet and fit close up against her, the front of
his thighs against the backs of hers, his head in the
spread curtain of her hair on the pillow.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond screwed up his eyes and opened them again.
He cautiously lifted his wrist. Four o’clock. Only one
more hour to the Turkish frontier. Perhaps he would
be able to sleep during the day. He would give her the
gun and wedge the doors again and she could watch.</p>

<p class="pindent">He looked down at the beautiful sleeping profile.
How innocent she looked, this girl from the Russian
Secret Service—the lashes fringing the soft swell of
the cheek, the lips parted and unaware, the long strand
of hair that had strayed untidily across her forehead
and that he wanted to brush back neatly to join the
rest, the steady slow throb of the pulse in the offered
neck. He felt a surge of tenderness and the impulse to
gather her up in his arms and strain her tight against
him. He wanted her to wake, from a dream perhaps,
so that he could kiss her and tell her that everything
was all right, and see her settle happily back to sleep.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl had insisted on sleeping like this. ‘I won’t
go to sleep unless you hold me,’ she had said. ‘I must
know you’re there all the time. It would be terrible to
wake up and not be touching you. Please James. Please
<span class="it">duschka</span>.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had taken off his coat and tie and had arranged
himself in the corner with his feet up on his suitcase
and the Beretta under the pillow within reach of his
hand. She had made no comment about the gun. She
had taken off all her clothes, except the black ribbon
round her throat, and had pretended not to be provocative
as she scrambled impudically into bed and wriggled
herself into a comfortable position. She had held up her
arms to him. Bond had pulled her head back by her
hair and had kissed her once, long and cruelly. Then
he had told her to go to sleep and had leant back and
waited icily for his body to leave him alone. Grumbling
sleepily, she had settled herself, with one arm flung
across his thighs. At first she had held him tightly,
but her arm had gradually relaxed and then she was
asleep.</p>

<p class="pindent">Brusquely Bond closed his mind to the thought of
her and focused on the journey ahead.</p>

<p class="pindent">Soon they would be out of Turkey. But would Greece
be any easier? No love lost between Greece and
England. And Yugoslavia? Whose side was Tito on?
Probably both. Whatever the orders of the three MGB
men, either they already knew Bond and Tatiana were
on the train or they would soon find out. He and the
girl couldn’t sit for four days in this coupé with the
blinds drawn. Their presence would be reported back
to Istanbul, telephoned from some station, and by the
morning the loss of the Spektor would have been
discovered. Then what? A hasty démarche through the
Russian embassy in Athens or Belgrade? Have the
girl taken off the train as a thief? Or was that all too
simple? And if it was more complicated—if all this
was part of some mysterious plot, some tortuous
Russian conspiracy—should he dodge it? Should he
and the girl leave the train at a wayside station, on the
wrong side of the track, and hire a car and somehow
get a plane to London?</p>

<p class="pindent">Outside, the luminous dawn had begun to edge the
racing trees and rocks with blue. Bond looked at his
watch. Five o’clock. They would soon be at Uzunkopru.
What was going on down the train behind him? What
had Kerim achieved?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat back, relaxed. After all there was a simple,
commonsense answer to his problem. If, between them,
they could quickly get rid of the three MGB agents, they
would stick to the train and to their original plan. If not,
Bond would get the girl and the machine off the train,
somewhere in Greece, and take another route home. But,
if the odds improved, Bond was for going on. He and
Kerim were resourceful men. Kerim had an agent in
Belgrade who was going to meet the train. There was
always the Embassy.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s mind raced on, adding up the pros, dismissing
the cons. Behind his reasoning, Bond calmly admitted
to himself that he had an insane desire to play the game
out and see what it was all about. He wanted to take
these people on and solve the mystery and, if it was
some sort of a plot, defeat it. M had left him in charge.
He had the girl and the machine under his hand. Why
panic? What was there to panic about? It would be mad
to run away and perhaps only escape one trap in order
to fall into another one.</p>

<p class="pindent">The train gave a long whistle and began to slacken
speed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now for the first round. If Kerim failed. If the three
men stayed on the train . . .</p>

<p class="pindent">Some goods trucks, led by a straining engine, filed
by. The silhouette of sheds showed briefly. With a jolt
and a screech of couplings, the Orient Express took
the points and swerved away from the through line.
Four sets of rails with grass growing between them
showed outside the window, and the empty length of
the down platform. A cock crowed. The express slowed
to walking speed and finally, with a sigh of hydraulic
brakes and a noisy whoosh of let-off steam, ground to
a stop. The girl stirred in her sleep. Bond softly shifted
her head on to the pillow and got up and slipped out
of the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a typical Balkan wayside station—a façade of
dour buildings in over-pointed stone, a dusty expanse
of platform, not raised, but level with the ground so
that there was a long step down from the train, some
chickens pecking about and a few drab officials standing
idly, unshaven, not even trying to look important. Up
towards the cheap half of the train, a chattering horde
of peasants with bundles and wicker baskets waited for
the customs and passport control so that they could
clamber aboard and join the swarm inside.</p>

<p class="pindent">Across the platform from Bond was a closed door
with a sign over it which said POLIS. Through the dirty
window beside the door Bond thought he caught a
glimpse of the head and shoulders of Kerim.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Passeports. Douanes!</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">A plain-clothes man and two policemen in dark green
uniform with pistol holsters at their black belts entered
the corridor. The wagon-lit conductor preceded them,
knocking on the doors.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the door of No12 the conductor made an indignant
speech in Turkish, holding out the stack of tickets
and passports and fanning through them as if they were
a pack of cards. When he had finished, the plain-clothes
man, beckoning forward the two policemen, knocked
smartly on the door and, when it was opened, stepped
inside. The two policemen stood guard behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond edged down the corridor. He could hear a
jumble of bad German. One voice was cold, the other
was frightened and hot. The passport and ticket of
Herr Kurt Goldfarb were missing. Had Herr Goldfarb
removed them from the conductor’s cabin? Certainly
not. Had Herr Goldfarb in truth ever surrendered his
papers to the conductor? Naturally. Then the matter
was unfortunate. An inquiry would have to be held.
No doubt the German Legation in Istanbul would
put the matter right (Bond smiled at this suggestion).
Meanwhile, it was regretted that Herr Goldfarb could
not continue his journey. No doubt he would be able
to proceed tomorrow. Herr Goldfarb would get
dressed. His luggage would be transported to the
waiting-room.</p>

<p class="pindent">The MGB man who erupted into the corridor was
the dark Caucasian-type man, the junior of the ‘visitors’.
His sallow face was grey with fear. His hair was awry
and he was dressed only in the bottom half of his
pyjamas. But there was nothing comical about his
desperate flurry down the corridor. He brushed past
Bond. At the door of No6 he paused and pulled
himself together. He knocked with tense control. The
door opened on the chain and Bond glimpsed a thick
nose and part of a moustache. The chain was slipped
and Goldfarb went in. There was silence, during which
the plain-clothes man dealt with the papers of two
elderly French women in Nos9 and 10, and then with
Bond’s.</p>

<p class="pindent">The officer barely glanced at Bond’s passport. He
snapped it shut and handed it to the conductor. ‘You
are travelling with Kerim Bey?’ he asked in French. His
eyes were remote.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Merci, Monsieur. Bon voyage.</span>’ The man saluted. He
turned and rapped sharply on the door of No6. The
door opened and he went in.</p>

<p class="pindent">Five minutes later the door was flung back. The plain-clothes
man, now erect with authority, beckoned forward
the policemen. He spoke to them harshly in Turkish.
He turned back to the coupé. ‘Consider yourself under
arrest, Mein Herr. Attempted bribery of officials is a
grave crime in Turkey.’ There was an angry clamour in
Goldfarb’s bad German. It was cut short by one hard
sentence in Russian. A different Goldfarb, a Goldfarb
with madman’s eyes, emerged and walked blindly down
the corridor and went into No12. A policeman stood
outside the door and waited.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And <span class="it">your</span> papers, Mein Herr. Please step forward. I
must verify this photograph.’ The plain-clothes man
held the green-backed German passport up to the light.
‘Forward please.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Reluctantly, his heavy face pale with anger, the MGB
man who called himself Benz stepped out into the
corridor in a brilliant blue silk dressing-gown. The hard
brown eyes looked straight into Bond’s, ignoring him.</p>

<p class="pindent">The plain-clothes man slapped the passport shut and
handed it to the conductor. ‘Your papers are in order,
Mein Herr. And now, if you please, the baggage.’ He
went in, followed by the second policeman. The MGB
man turned his blue back on Bond and watched the
search.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond noticed the bulge under the left arm of the
dressing-gown, and the ridge of a belt round the waist.
He wondered if he should tip off the plain-clothes man.
He decided it would be better to keep quiet. He might
be hauled in as a witness.</p>

<p class="pindent">The search was over. The plain-clothes man saluted
coldly and moved on down the corridor. The MGB
man went back into No6 and slammed the door behind
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Pity, thought Bond. One had got away.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned back to the window. A bulky man,
wearing a grey Homburg, and with an angry boil on
the back of his neck, was being escorted through
the door marked <span class="sc">polis</span>. Down the corridor a door
slammed. Goldfarb, escorted by the policeman,
stepped down off the train. With bent head, he walked
across the dusty platform and disappeared through
the same door.</p>

<p class="pindent">The engine whistled, a new kind of whistle, the brave
shrill blast of a Greek engine-driver. The door of the
wagon-lit carriage clanged shut. The plain-clothes man
and the second policeman appeared walking over to the
station. The guard at the back of the train looked at
his watch and held out his flag. There was a jerk and a
diminishing crescendo of explosive puffs from the
engine and the front section of the Orient Express
began to move. The section that would be taking the
northern route through the Iron Curtain—through
Dragoman on the Bulgarian frontier, only fifty miles
away—was left beside the dusty platform, waiting.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond pulled down the window and took a last look
back at the Turkish frontier, where two men would be
sitting in a bare room under what amounted to sentence
of death. Two birds down, he thought. Two out of
three. The odds looked more respectable.</p>

<p class="pindent">He watched the dead, dusty platform, with its
chickens and the small black figure of the guard, until
the long train took the points and jerked harshly on
to the single main line. He looked away across the ugly,
parched countryside towards the golden guinea sun
climbing out of the Turkish plain. It was going to be
a beautiful day.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond drew his head in out of the cool, sweet morning
air. He pulled up the window with a bang.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had made up his mind. He would stay on the
train and see the thing through.</p>
