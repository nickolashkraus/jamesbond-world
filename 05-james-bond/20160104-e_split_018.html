<p class="pindent">The four small, square-ended propellers turned slowly,
one by one, and became four whizzing pools. The low
hum of the turbo-jets rose to a shrill smooth whine.
The quality of the noise, and the complete absence of
vibration, were different from the stuttering roar and
straining horsepower of all other aircraft Bond had
flown in. As the Viscount wheeled easily out to the
shimmering east-west runway of London Airport,
Bond felt as if he was sitting in an expensive mechanical
toy.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a pause as the chief pilot gunned up the
four turbo-jets into a banshee scream and then, with a
jerk of released brakes, the 10.30 BEA Flight 130 to
Rome, Athens and Istanbul gathered speed and hurtled
down the runway and up into a quick, easy climb.</p>

<p class="pindent">In ten minutes they had reached 20,000 feet and
were heading south along the wide air-channel that
takes the Mediterranean traffic from England. The
scream of the jets died to a low, drowsy whistle. Bond
unfastened his seat-belt and lit a cigarette. He reached
for the slim, expensive-looking attaché case on the
floor beside him and took out <span class="it">The Mask of Dimitrios</span>
by Eric Ambler and put the case, which was very heavy
in spite of its size, on the seat beside him. He thought
how surprised the ticket clerk at London Airport would
have been if she had weighed the case instead of
letting it go unchecked as an ‘overnight bag’. And if,
in their turn, Customs had been intrigued by its weight,
how interested they would have been when it was
slipped under the Inspectoscope.</p>

<p class="pindent">Q Branch had put together this smart-looking little
bag, ripping out the careful handiwork of Swaine and
Adeney to pack fifty rounds of .25 ammunition, in two
flat rows, between the leather and the lining of the
spine. In each of the innocent sides there was a flat
throwing knife, built by Wilkinsons, the sword-makers,
and the tops of their handles were concealed cleverly
by the stitching at the corners. Despite Bond’s efforts
to laugh them out of it, Q’s craftsmen had insisted on
building a hidden compartment into the handle of the
case, which, by pressure at a certain point, would deliver
a cyanide death-pill into the palm of his hand. (Directly
he had taken delivery of the case, Bond had washed
this pill down the lavatory.) More important was the
thick tube of Palmolive shaving cream in the otherwise
guileless spongebag. The whole top of this unscrewed
to reveal the silencer for the Beretta, packed in cotton
wool. In case hard cash was needed, the lid of the
attaché case contained fifty golden sovereigns. These
could be poured out by slipping sideways one ridge of
welting.</p>

<p class="pindent">The complicated bag of tricks amused Bond, but he
also had to admit that, despite its eight-pound weight,
the bag was a convenient way of carrying the tools of
his trade, which otherwise would have to be concealed
about his body.</p>

<p class="pindent">Only a dozen miscellaneous passengers were on the
plane. Bond smiled at the thought of Loelia Ponsonby’s
horror if she knew that that made the load thirteen. The
day before, when he had left M and had gone back to
his office to arrange the details of his flight, his secretary
had protested violently at the idea of his travelling on
Friday the thirteenth.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But it’s always best to travel on the thirteenth,’ Bond
had explained patiently. ‘There are practically no passengers
and it’s more comfortable and you get better
service. I always choose the thirteenth when I can.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well,’ she had said resignedly, ‘it’s your funeral. But
I shall spend the day worrying about you. And for
heaven’s sake don’t go walking under ladders or anything
silly this afternoon. You oughtn’t to overplay your luck
like this. I don’t know what you’re going to Turkey for,
and I don’t want to know. But I have a feeling in my
bones.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ah, those beautiful bones!’ Bond had teased her. ‘I’ll
take them out to dinner the night I get back.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’ll do nothing of the sort,’ she had said coldly.
Later she had kissed him goodbye with a sudden
warmth, and for the hundredth time Bond had wondered
why he bothered with other women when the most
darling of them all was his secretary.</p>

<p class="pindent">The plane sang steadily on above the endless sea of
whipped-cream clouds that looked solid enough to land
on if the engines failed. The clouds broke up and a
distant blue haze, far away to their left, was Paris. For
an hour they flew high over the burned-up fields of
France until, after Dijon, the land turned from a pale
to a darker green as it sloped up into the Juras.</p>

<p class="pindent">Lunch came. Bond put aside his book and the
thoughts that kept coming between him and the printed
page, and, while he ate, he gazed down at the cool
mirror of the Lake of Geneva. As the pine forests
began to climb towards the snow patches between the
beautifully scoured teeth of the Alps, he remembered
early skiing holidays. The plane skirted the great eyetooth
of Mont Blanc, a few hundred yards to port, and
Bond looked down at the dirty grey elephant’s skin of
the glaciers and saw himself again, a young man in his
teens, with the leading end of the rope round his waist,
bracing himself against the top of a rock-chimney on
the Aiguilles Rouges as his two companions from the
University of Geneva inched up the smooth rock
towards him.</p>

<p class="pindent">And now? Bond smiled wryly at his reflection in
the Perspex as the plane swung out of the mountains
and over the grosgrained terrazza of Lombardy. If
that young James Bond came up to him in the street
and talked to him, would he recognize the clean, eager
youth that had been him at seventeen? And what
would that youth think of him, the secret agent, the
older James Bond? Would he recognize himself
beneath the surface of this man who was tarnished
with years of treachery and ruthlessness and fear—this
man with the cold arrogant eyes and the scar down
his cheek and the flat bulge beneath his left armpit?
If the youth did recognize him what would his judgment
be? What would he think of Bond’s present
assignment? What would he think of the dashing
secret agent who was off across the world in a new
and most romantic role—to pimp for England?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond put the thought of his dead youth out of his
mind. Never job backwards. What-might-have-been was
a waste of time. Follow your fate, and be satisfied with
it, and be glad not to be a second-hand motor salesman,
or a yellow-press journalist, pickled in gin and nicotine, or
a cripple—or dead.</p>

<p class="pindent">Gazing down on the sun-baked sprawl of Genoa and
the gentle blue waters of the Mediterranean, Bond
closed his mind to the past and focused it on the immediate
future—on this business, as he sourly described
it to himself, of ‘pimping for England’.</p>

<p class="pindent">For that, however else one might like to describe it,
was what he was on his way to do—to seduce, and
seduce very quickly, a girl whom he had never seen
before, whose name he had heard yesterday for the
first time. And all the while, however attractive she
was—and Head of T had described her as ‘very beautiful’—Bond’s
whole mind would have to be not on
what she was, but on what she had—the dowry she
was bringing with her. It would be like trying to marry
a rich woman for her money. Would he be able to act
the part? Perhaps he could make the right faces and
say the right things, but would his body dissociate
itself from his secret thoughts and effectively make
the love he would declare? How did men behave credibly
in bed when their whole minds were focused on
a woman’s bank balance? Perhaps there was an erotic
stimulus in the notion that one was ravaging a sack
of gold. But a cipher machine?</p>

<p class="pindent">Elba passed below them and the plane slid into its
fifty-mile glide towards Rome. Half an hour among the
jabbering loudspeakers of Ciampino Airport, time to
drink two excellent Americanos, and they were on their
way again, flying steadily down towards the toe of Italy,
and Bond’s mind went back to sifting the minutest
details of the rendezvous that was drawing closer at
three hundred miles an hour.</p>

<p class="pindent">Was it all a complicated MGB plot of which he
couldn’t find the key? Was he walking into some trap
that not even the tortuous mind of M could fathom?
God knew M was worried about the possibility of such
a trap. Every conceivable angle of the evidence, for and
against, had been scrutinized—not only by M, but also
by a full-dress operations meeting of Heads of Sections
that had worked all through the afternoon and evening
before. But, which ever way the case had been examined,
no one had been able to suggest what the Russians
might get out of it. They might want to kidnap Bond
and interrogate him. But why Bond? He was an operating
agent, unconcerned with the general working of
the Service, carrying in his head nothing of use to the
Russians except the details of his current duty and a
certain amount of background information that could
not possibly be vital. Or they might want to kill Bond,
as an act of revenge. Yet he had not come up against
them for two years. If they wanted to kill him, they had
only to shoot him in the streets of London, or in his
flat, or put a bomb in his car.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s thoughts were interrupted by the stewardess.
‘Fasten your seat-belts, please.’ As she spoke the plane
dropped sickeningly and soared up again with an ugly
note of strain in the scream of the jets. The sky outside
was suddenly black. Rain hammered on the windows.
There came a blinding flash of blue and white light and
a crash as if an anti-aircraft shell had hit them, and the
plane heaved and bucketed in the belly of the electric
storm that had ambushed them out of the mouth of
the Adriatic.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smelt the smell of danger. It is a real smell,
something like the mixture of sweat and electricity you
get in an amusement arcade. Again the lightning flung its
hands across the windows. Crash! It felt as if they were
the centre of the thunder clap. Suddenly the plane seemed
incredibly small and frail. Thirteen passengers! Friday the
Thirteenth! Bond thought of Loelia Ponsonby’s words
and his hands on the arms of his chair felt wet. How old
is this plane, he wondered? How many flying hours has
it done? Had the death-watch beetle of metal fatigue got
into the wings? How much of their strength had it eaten
away? Perhaps he wouldn’t get to Istanbul after all. Perhaps
a plummeting crash into the Gulf of Corinth was going
to be the destiny he had been scanning philosophically
only an hour before.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the centre of Bond was a hurricane-room, the
kind of citadel found in old-fashioned houses in the
tropics. These rooms are small, strongly built cells in
the heart of the house, in the middle of the ground
floor and sometimes dug down into its foundations.
To this cell the owner and his family retire if the storm
threatens to destroy the house, and they stay there
until the danger is past. Bond went to his hurricane-room
only when the situation was beyond his control
and no other possible action could be taken. Now he
retired to this citadel, closed his mind to the hell of
noise and violent movement, and focused on a single
stitch in the back of the seat in front of him, waiting
with slackened nerves for whatever fate had decided
for BEA Flight No130.</p>

<p class="pindent">Almost at once it got lighter in the cabin. The rain
stopped crashing on the Perspex window and the noise
of the jets settled back into their imperturbable whistle.
Bond opened the door of his hurricane-room and
stepped out. He slowly turned his head and looked
curiously out of the window and watched the tiny
shadow of the plane hastening far below across the
quiet waters of the Gulf of Corinth. He heaved a deep
sigh and reached into his hip-pocket for his gunmetal
cigarette case. He was pleased to see his hands were
dead steady as he took out his lighter and lit one of
the Morland cigarettes with the three gold rings. Should
he tell Lil that perhaps she had almost been right? He
decided that if he could find a rude enough postcard
in Istanbul he would.</p>

<p class="pindent">The day outside faded through the colours of a dying
dolphin and Mount Hymettus came at them, blue in
the dusk. Down over the twinkling sprawl of Athens
and then the Viscount was wheeling across the standard
concrete airstrip with its drooping windsock and the
notices in the strange dancing letters Bond had hardly
seen since school.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond climbed out of the plane with the handful of
pale, silent passengers and walked across to the transit
lounge and up to the bar. He ordered a tumbler of
ouzo and drank it down and chased it with a mouthful
of ice water. There was a strong bite under the sickly
anisette taste and Bond felt the drink light a quick, small
fire down his throat and in his stomach. He put down
his glass and ordered another.</p>

<p class="pindent">By the time the loudspeakers called him out again it
was dusk and the half moon rode clear and high above
the lights of the town. The air was soft with evening
and the smell of flowers and there was the steady pulsebeat
of the cicadas—zing-a-zing-a-zing—and the distant
sound of a man singing. The voice was clear and sad
and the song had a note of lament. Near the airport a
dog barked excitedly at an unknown human smell. Bond
suddenly realized that he had come into the East where
the guard-dog howls all night. For some reason the
realization sent a pang of pleasure and excitement into
his heart.</p>

<p class="pindent">They had only a ninety-minute flight to Istanbul,
across the dark Aegean and the Sea of Marmara. An
excellent dinner, with two dry Martinis and a half-bottle
of Calvet claret put Bond’s reservations about flying on
Friday the thirteenth, and his worries about his assignment,
out of his mind and substituted a mood of
pleased anticipation.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then they were there and the plane’s four propellers
wheeled to a stop outside the fine modern airport of
Yesilkoy, an hour’s drive from Istanbul. Bond said
goodbye and thank you for a good flight to the stewardess,
carried the heavy little attaché case through the
passport check into the customs, and waited for his
suitcase to come off the plane.</p>

<p class="pindent">So these dark, ugly, neat little officials were the
modern Turks. He listened to their voices, full of broad
vowels and quiet sibilants and modified u-sounds, and
he watched the dark eyes that belied the soft, polite
voices. They were bright, angry, cruel eyes that had only
lately come down from the mountains. Bond thought
he knew the history of those eyes. They were eyes that
had been trained for centuries to watch over sheep and
decipher small movements on far horizons. They were
eyes that kept the knife-hand in sight without seeming
to, that counted the grains of meal and the small fractions
of coin and noted the flicker of the merchant’s
fingers. They were hard, untrusting, jealous eyes. Bond
didn’t take to them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Outside the customs, a tall rangy man with drooping
black moustaches stepped out of the shadows. He wore
a smart dust-coat and a chauffeur’s cap. He saluted and,
without asking Bond his name, took his suitcase and
led the way over to a gleaming aristocrat of a car—an
old black basketwork Rolls-Royce coupé-de-ville that
Bond guessed must have been built for some millionaire
of the ’20s.</p>

<p class="pindent">When the car was gliding out of the airport, the man
turned and said politely over his shoulder, in excellent
English, ‘Kerim Bey thought you would prefer to rest
tonight, sir. I am to call for you at nine tomorrow
morning. What hotel are you staying at, sir?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The Kristal Palas.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Very good, sir.’ The car sighed off down the wide
modern road.</p>

<p class="pindent">Behind them, in the dappled shadows of the airport
parking place, Bond vaguely heard the crackle of a
motor scooter starting up. The sound meant nothing
to him and he settled back to enjoy the drive.</p>
