<p class="pindent">Not that it matters, but a great deal of the background
to this story is accurate.</p>

<p class="pindent"><span class="sc">smersh</span>, a contraction of Smiert Spionam—Death
to Spies—exists and remains today the most
secret department of the Soviet government.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the beginning of 1956, when this book was
written, the strength of <span class="sc">smersh</span> at home and abroad
was about 40,000 and General Grubozaboyschikov
was its chief. My description of his appearance is
correct.</p>

<p class="pindent">Today the headquarters of <span class="sc">smersh</span> are where, in
Chapter 4, I have placed them—at No 13 Sretenka
Ulitsa, Moscow. The Conference Room is faithfully
described and the Intelligence chiefs who meet
round the table are real officials who are frequently
summoned to that room for purposes similar to
those I have recounted.</p>
