<p class="pindent">Coffee came again, and then more coffee, and the big
room grew thick with cigarette smoke as the two men
took each shred of evidence, dissected it and put it
aside. At the end of an hour they were back where they
had started. It was up to Bond to solve the problem
of this girl and, if he was satisfied with her story, get
her and the machine out of the country.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim undertook to look after the administrative
problems. As a first step he picked up the telephone
and spoke to his travel agent and reserved two seats on
every outgoing plane for the next week—by BEA, Air
France, SAS and Turkair.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And now you must have a passport,’ he said. ‘One
will be sufficient. She can travel as your wife. One of
my men will take your photograph and he will find a
photograph of some girl who looks more or less like
her. As a matter of fact, an early picture of Garbo
would serve. There is a certain resemblance. He can get
one from the newspaper files. I will speak to the Consul
General. He’s an excellent fellow who likes my little
cloak-and-dagger plots. The passport will be ready by
this evening. What name would you like to have?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Take one out of a hat.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Somerset. My mother came from there. David Somerset.
Profession, Company Director. That means nothing. And
the girl? Let us say Caroline. She looks like a Caroline. A
couple of clean-limbed young English people with a taste
for travel. Finance Control Form? Leave that to me. It
will show eighty pounds in traveller’s cheques, let’s say,
and a receipt from the bank to show you changed fifty
while you were in Turkey. Customs? They never look at
anything. Only too glad if somebody has bought something
in the country. You will declare some Turkish Delight—presents
for your friends in London. If you have to get
out quickly, leave your hotel bill and luggage to me. They
know me well enough at the Palas. Anything else?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I can’t think of anything.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim looked at his watch. ‘Twelve o’clock. Just time
for the car to take you back to your hotel. There might
be a message. And have a good look at your things to
see if anyone has been inquisitive.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He rang the bell and fired instructions at the head
clerk who stood with his sharp eyes on Kerim’s and his
lean head straining forward like a whippet’s.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim led Bond to the door. There came again the
warm powerful handclasp. ‘The car will bring you to
lunch,’ he said. ‘A little place in the Spice Bazaar.’ His
eyes looked happily into Bond’s. ‘And I am glad to be
working with you. We will do well together.’ He let go
of Bond’s hand. ‘And now I have a lot of things to do
very quickly. They may be the wrong things, but at any
rate,’ he grinned broadly, ‘<span class="it">jouons mal, mais jouons vite!</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">The head clerk, who seemed to be some sort of
chief-of-staff to Kerim, led Bond through another door
in the wall of the raised platform. The heads were still
bowed over the ledgers. There was a short passage
with rooms on either side. The man led the way into
one of these and Bond found himself in an extremely
well-equipped dark-room and laboratory. In ten
minutes he was out again on the street. The Rolls
edged out of the narrow alley and back again on to
the Galata Bridge.</p>

<p class="pindent">A new concierge was on duty at the Kristal Palace,
a small obsequious man with guilty eyes in a yellow
face. He came out from behind the desk, his hands
spread in apology. ‘Effendi, I greatly regret. My colleague
showed you to an inadequate room. It was not realized
that you are a friend of Kerim Bey. Your things have
been moved to No12. It is the best room in the hotel.
In fact,’ the concierge leered, ‘it is the room reserved
for honeymoon couples. Every comfort. My apologies,
Effendi. The other room is not intended for visitors of
distinction.’ The man executed an oily bow, washing his
hands.</p>

<p class="pindent">If there was one thing Bond couldn’t stand it was
the sound of his boots being licked. He looked the
concierge in the eyes and said, ‘Oh.’ The eyes slid away.
‘Let me see this room. I may not like it. I was quite
comfortable where I was.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Certainly, Effendi,’ the man bowed Bond to the lift.
‘But alas the plumbers are in your former room. The
water supply . . .’ the voice trailed away. The lift rose
about ten feet and stopped at the first floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">Well, the story of the plumbers makes sense, reflected
Bond. And, after all, there was no harm in having the
best room in the hotel.</p>

<p class="pindent">The concierge unlocked a high door and stood
back.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had to approve. The sun streamed in through
wide double windows that gave on to a small balcony.
The motif was pink and grey and the style was mock
French Empire, battered by the years, but still with all
the elegance of the turn of the century. There were
fine Bokhara rugs on the parquet floor. A glittering
chandelier hung from the ornate ceiling. The bed against
the right-hand wall was huge. A large mirror in a gold
frame covered most of the wall behind it. (Bond was
amused. The honeymoon room! Surely there should be
a mirror on the ceiling as well.) The adjoining bathroom
was tiled and fitted with everything, including a bidet
and a shower. Bond’s shaving things were neatly laid
out.</p>

<p class="pindent">The concierge followed Bond back into the bedroom,
and when Bond said he would take the room, bowed
himself gratefully out.</p>

<p class="pindent">Why not? Bond again walked round the room. This
time he carefully inspected the walls and the neighbourhood
of the bed and the telephone. Why not take the
room? Why would there be microphones or secret
doors? What would be the point of them?</p>

<p class="pindent">His suitcase was on a bench near the chest-of-drawers.
He knelt down. No scratches round the lock. The bit
of fluff he had trapped in the clasp was still there. He
unlocked the suitcase and took out the little attaché case.
Again no signs of interference. Bond locked the case
and got to his feet.</p>

<p class="pindent">He washed and went out of the room and down
the stairs. No, there had been no messages for the
Effendi. The concierge bowed as he opened the door
of the Rolls. Was there a hint of conspiracy behind the
permanent guilt in those eyes? Bond decided not to
care if there was. The game, whatever it was, had to be
played out. If the change of rooms had been the
opening gambit, so much the better. The game had to
begin somewhere.</p>

<p class="pindent">As the car sped back down the hill, Bond’s thoughts
turned to Darko Kerim. What a man for Head of Station
T! His size alone, in this country of furtive, stunted
little men, would give him authority, and his giant vitality
and love of life would make everyone his friend. Where
had this exuberant shrewd pirate come from? And how
had he come to work for the Service? He was the rare
type of man that Bond loved, and Bond already felt
prepared to add Kerim to the half dozen of those real
friends whom Bond, who had no ‘acquaintances’, would
be ready to take to his heart.</p>

<p class="pindent">The car went back over the Galata Bridge and drew
up outside the vaulted arcades of the Spice Bazaar. The
chauffeur led the way up the shallow worn steps and into
the fog of exotic scents, shouting curses at the beggars
and sack-laden porters. Inside the entrance the chauffeur
turned left out of the stream of shuffling, jabbering
humanity and showed Bond a small arch in the thick
wall. Turret-like stone steps curled upwards.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Effendi, you will find Kerim Bey in the far room on
the left. You have only to ask. He is known to all.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond climbed the cool stairs to a small ante-room
where a waiter, without asking his name, took charge
and led him through a maze of small, colourfully tiled,
vaulted rooms to where Kerim was sitting at a corner
table over the entrance to the bazaar, Kerim greeted
him boisterously, waving a glass of milky liquid in which
ice twinkled.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Here you are my friend! Now, at once, some raki.
You must be exhausted after your sight-seeing.’ He fired
orders at the waiter.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat down in a comfortable-armed chair and
took the small tumbler the waiter offered him. He lifted
it towards Kerim and tasted it. It was identical with
ouzo. He drank it down. At once the waiter refilled his
glass.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And now to order your lunch. They eat nothing but
offal cooked in rancid olive oil in Turkey. At least the
offal at the Misir Carsarsi is the best.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The grinning waiter made suggestions.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He says the Doner Kebab is very good today. I don’t
believe him, but it can be. It is very young lamb broiled
over charcoal with savoury rice. Lots of onions in it.
Or is there anything you prefer? A pilaff or some of
those damned stuffed peppers they eat here? All right
then. And you must start with a few sardines grilled <span class="it">en
papillote</span>. They are just edible.’ Kerim harangued the
waiter. He sat back, smiling at Bond. ‘That is the only
way to treat these damned people. They love to be
cursed and kicked. It is all they understand. It is in the
blood. All this pretence of democracy is killing them.
They want some sultans and wars and rape and fun.
Poor brutes, in their striped suits and bowler hats. They
are miserable. You’ve only got to look at them. However,
to hell with them all. Any news?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shook his head. He told Kerim about the change
of room and the untouched suitcase.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim downed a glass of raki and wiped his mouth
on the back of his hand. He echoed the thought Bond
had had. ‘Well, the game must begin sometime. I have
made certain small moves. Now we can only wait and
see. We will make a little foray into enemy territory after
lunch. I think it will interest you. Oh, we shan’t be seen.
We shall move in the shadows, underground.’ Kerim
laughed delightedly at his cleverness. ‘And now let us
talk about other things. How do you like Turkey? No,
I don’t want to know. What else?’</p>

<p class="pindent">They were interrupted by the arrival of their first
course. Bond’s sardines en papillote tasted like any other
fried sardines. Kerim set about a large plate of what
appeared to be strips of raw fish. He saw Bond’s look
of interest. ‘Raw fish,’ he said. ‘After this I shall have
raw meat and lettuce and then I shall have a bowl of
yoghourt. I am not a faddist, but I once trained to be
a professional strong man. It is a good profession in
Turkey. The public loves them. And my trainer insisted
that I should eat only raw food. I got the habit. It is
good for me, but,’ he waved his fork, ‘I do not pretend
it is good for everyone. I don’t care the hell what other
people eat so long as they enjoy it. I can’t stand sad
eaters and sad drinkers.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Why did you decide not to be a strong man? How
did you get into this racket?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim forked up a strip of fish and tore at it with
his teeth. He drank down half a tumbler of raki. He
lit a cigarette and sat back in his chair. ‘Well,’ he said
with a sour grin, ‘we might as well talk about me as
about anything else. And you must be wondering “How
did this big crazy man get into the Service?” I will tell
you, but briefly, because it is a long story. You will stop
me if you get bored. All right?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Fine.’ Bond lit a Diplomate. He leant forward on his
elbows.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I come from Trebizond.’ Kerim watched his cigarette
smoke curl upwards. ‘We were a huge family with many
mothers. My father was the sort of man women can’t
resist. All women want to be swept off their feet. In
their dreams they long to be slung over a man’s shoulder
and taken into a cave and raped. That was his way with
them. My father was a great fisherman and his fame
was spread all over the Black Sea. He went after the
swordfish. They are difficult to catch and hard to fight
and he would always outdo all others after these fish.
Women like their men to be heroes. He was a kind of
hero in a corner of Turkey where it is a tradition for
the men to be tough. He was a big, romantic sort of
fellow. So he could have any woman he wanted. He
wanted them all and sometimes killed other men to
get them. Naturally he had many children. We all lived
on top of each other in a great rambling old ruin of
a house that our “aunts” made habitable. The aunts
really amounted to a harem. One of them was an
English governess from Istanbul my father had seen
watching a circus. He took a fancy to her and she
to him and that evening he put her on board his
fishing boat and sailed up the Bosphorus and back to
Trebizond. I don’t think she ever regretted it. I think
she forgot all the world except him. She died just after
the war. She was sixty. The child before me had been
by an Italian girl and the girl had called him Bianco.
He was fair. I was dark. I got to be called Darko. There
were fifteen of us children and we had a wonderful
childhood. Our aunts fought often and so did we. It
was like a gipsy encampment. It was held together by
my father who thrashed us, women or children, when
we were a nuisance. But he was good to us when we
were peaceful and obedient. You cannot understand
such a family?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The way you describe it I can.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Anyway so it was. I grew up to be nearly as big a
man as my father, but better educated. My mother saw
to that. My father only taught us to be clean and to go
to the lavatory once a day and never to feel shame about
anything in the world. My mother also taught me a
regard for England, but that is by the way. By the time
I was twenty, I had a boat of my own and I was making
money. But I was wild. I left the big house and went
to live in two small rooms on the waterfront. I wanted to
have my women where my mother would not know.
There was a stroke of bad luck. I had a little Bessarabian
hell-cat. I had won her in a fight with some gipsies,
here in the hills behind Istanbul. They came after me,
but I got her on board the boat. I had to knock her
unconscious first. She was still trying to kill me when
we got back to Trebizond, so I got her to my place and
took away all her clothes and kept her chained naked
under the table. When I ate, I used to throw scraps to
her under the table, like a dog. She had to learn who
was master. Before that could happen, my mother did
an unheard of thing. She visited my place without
warning. She came to tell me that my father wanted to
see me immediately. She found the girl. My mother was
really angry with me for the first time in my life. Angry?
She was beside herself. I was a cruel ne’er-do-well and
she was ashamed to call me son. The girl must immediately
be taken back to her people. My mother brought
her some of her own clothes from the house. The girl
put them on, but when the time came, she refused to
leave me.’ Darko Kerim laughed hugely. ‘An interesting
lesson in female psychology, my dear friend. However,
the problem of the girl is another story. While my mother
was fussing over her and getting nothing but gipsy
curses for her pains, I was having an interview with my
father, who had heard nothing of all this and who never
did hear. My mother was like that. There was another
man with my father, a tall, quiet Englishman with a
black patch over one eye. They were talking about the
Russians. The Englishman wanted to know what they
were doing along their frontier, about what was going
on at Batoum, their big oil and naval base only fifty
miles away from Trebizond. He would pay good money
for information. I knew English and I knew Russian. I
had good eyes and ears. I had a boat. My father had
decided that I would work for the Englishman. And
that Englishman, my dear friend, was Major Dansey,
my predecessor as Head of this Station. And the rest,’
Kerim made a wide gesture with his cigarette holder,
‘you can imagine.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But what about this training to be a professional
strong man?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ah,’ said Kerim slyly, ‘that was only a sideline. Our
travelling circuses were almost the only Turks allowed
through the frontier. The Russians cannot live without
circuses. It is as simple as that. I was the man who
broke chains and lifted weights by a rope between my
teeth. I wrestled against the local strong men in the
Russian villages. And some of those Georgians are
giants. Fortunately they are stupid giants and I nearly
always won. Afterwards, at the drinking, there was always
much talk and gossip. I would look foolish and pretend
not to understand. Every now and then I would ask an
innocent question and they would laugh at my stupidity
and tell me the answer.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The second course came, and with it a bottle of
Kavaklidere, a rich coarse burgundy like any other Balkan
wine. The Kebab was good and tasted of smoked bacon
fat and onions. Kerim ate a kind of Steak Tartare—a
large flat hamburger of finely minced raw meat laced
with peppers and chives and bound together with yolk
of egg. He made Bond try a forkful. It was delicious.
Bond said so.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You ought to eat it every day,’ said Kerim earnestly.
‘It is good for those who wish to make much love.
There are certain exercises you should do for the same
purpose. These things are important to men. Or at least
they are to me. Like my father, I consume a large quantity
of women. But, unlike him, I also drink and smoke
too much, and these things do not go well with making
love. Nor does this work I do. Too many tensions and
too much thinking. It takes the blood to the head instead
of to where it should be for making love. But I am
greedy for life. I do too much of everything all the
time. Suddenly one day my heart will fail. The Iron Crab
will get me as it got my father. But I am not afraid of
The Crab. At least I shall have died from an honourable
disease. Perhaps they will put on my tombstone “This
Man Died from Living Too Much”.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. ‘Don’t go too soon, Darko,’ he said.
‘M would be very displeased. He thinks the world of
you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He does?’ Kerim searched Bond’s face to see if he
was telling the truth. He laughed delightedly. ‘In that
case I will not let The Crab have my body yet.’ He
looked at his watch. ‘Come, James,’ he said. ‘It is good
that you reminded me of my duty. We will have coffee
in the office. There is not much time to waste. Every
day at 2.30 the Russians have their council of war. Today
you and I will do them the honour of being present at
their deliberations.’</p>
