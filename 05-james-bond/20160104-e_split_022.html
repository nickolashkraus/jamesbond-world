<p class="pindent">It was seven o’clock on the same evening and James
Bond was back in his hotel. He had had a hot bath and
a cold shower. He thought that he had at last scoured
the zoo smell out of his skin.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was sitting, naked except for his shorts, at one
of the windows of his room, sipping a vodka and tonic
and looking out into the heart of the great tragic sunset
over the Golden Horn. But his eyes didn’t see the torn
cloth of gold and blood that hung behind the minareted
stage beneath which he had caught his first glimpse of
Tatiana Romanova.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was thinking of the tall beautiful girl with the
dancer’s long gait who had walked through the drab door
with a piece of paper in her hand. She had stood beside
her Chief and handed him the paper. All the men had
looked up at her. She had blushed and looked down.
What had that expression on the men’s faces meant? It
was more than just the way some men look at a beautiful
girl. They had shown curiosity. That was reasonable. They
wanted to know what was in the signal, why they were
being disturbed. But what else? There had been slyness
and contempt—the way people stare at prostitutes.</p>

<p class="pindent">It had been an odd, enigmatic scene. This was part
of a highly disciplined paramilitary organization. These
were serving officers, each of whom would be wary
of the others. And this girl was just one of the staff,
with a corporal’s rank, who was now going through a
normal routine. Why had they all unguardedly looked
at her with this inquisitive contempt—almost as if
she was a spy who had been caught and was going to
be executed? Did they suspect her? Had she given
herself away? But that seemed less likely as the scene
played itself out. The Resident Director read the signal
and the other men’s eyes turned away from the girl
and on to him. He said something, presumably
repeating the text of the signal, and the men looked
glumly back at him as if the matter did not interest
them. Then the Resident Director looked up at the
girl and the other eyes followed his. He said something
with a friendly, inquiring expression. The girl shook
her head and answered briefly. The other men now
only looked interested. The Director said one word
with a question mark on the end. The girl blushed
deeply, and nodded, holding his eyes obediently. The
other men smiled encouragement, slyly perhaps, but
with approval. No suspicion there. No condemnation.
The scene ended with a few sentences from the
Director to which the girl seemed to say the equivalent
of ‘Yes, sir’ and turned and walked out of the room.
When she had gone, the Director said something with
an expression of irony on his face and the men laughed
heartily and the sly expression was back on their faces,
as if what he had said had been obscene. Then they
went back to their work.</p>

<p class="pindent">Ever since, on their way back down the tunnel, and
later in Kerim’s office while they discussed what Bond
had seen, Bond had racked his brains for a solution to
this maddening bit of dumb crambo and now, looking
without focus at the dying sun, he was still mystified.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond finished his drink and lit another cigarette. He
put the problem away and turned his mind to the girl.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana Romanova. A Romanov. Well, she certainly
looked like a Russian princess, or the traditional idea
of one. The tall, fine-boned body that moved so gracefully
and stood so well. The thick sweep of hair down
to the shoulders and the quiet authority of the profile.
The wonderful Garboesque face with its curiously shy
serenity. The contrast between the level innocence of
the big, deep blue eyes and the passionate promise of
a wide mouth. And the way she had blushed and the
way the long eyelashes had come down over the lowered
eyes. Had that been the prudery of a virgin? Bond
thought not. There was the confidence of having been
loved in the proud breasts and the insolently lilting
behind—the assertion of a body that knows what it
can be for.</p>

<p class="pindent">On what Bond had seen, could he believe that she
was the sort of girl to fall in love with a photograph
and a file? How could one tell? Such a girl would have
a deeply romantic nature. There were dreams in the eyes
and in the mouth. At that age, twenty-four, the Soviet
machine would not yet have ground the sentiment out
of her. The Romanov blood might well have given her
a yearning for men other than the type of modern
Russian officer she would meet—stern, cold, mechanical,
basically hysterical and, because of their Party education,
infernally dull.</p>

<p class="pindent">It could be true. There was nothing to disprove her
story in her looks. Bond wanted it to be true.</p>

<p class="pindent">The telephone rang. It was Kerim. ‘Nothing new?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Then I will pick you up at eight.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ll be ready.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laid down the receiver and slowly started to
put on his clothes.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim had been firm about the evening. Bond had
wanted to stay in his hotel room and wait for the first
contact to be made—a note, a telephone call, whatever
it might be. But Kerim had said no. The girl had been
adamant that she would choose her own time and place.
It would be wrong for Bond to seem a slave to her
convenience. ‘That is bad psychology, my friend,’ Kerim
had insisted. ‘No girl likes a man to run when she
whistles. She would despise you if you made yourself
too available. From your face and your dossier she would
expect you to behave with indifference—even with
insolence. She would want that. She wishes to court
you, to buy a kiss’—Kerim had winked—‘from that
cruel mouth. It is with an image she has fallen in love.
Behave like that image. Act the part.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had shrugged his shoulders. ‘All right, Darko.
I daresay you’re right. What do you suggest?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Live the life you would normally. Go home now and
have a bath and a drink. The local vodka is all right if
you drown it with tonic water. If nothing happens, I
will pick you up at eight. We will have dinner at the
place of a gipsy friend of mine. A man called Vavra.
He is head of a tribe. I must anyway see him tonight. He
is one of my best sources. He is finding out who tried
to blow up my office. Some of his girls will dance for
you. I will not suggest that they should entertain you
more intimately. You must keep your sword sharp. There
is a saying “Once a King, always a King. But once a
Knight is enough!” ’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was smiling at the memory of Kerim’s dictum
when the telephone rang again. He picked up the
receiver. It was only the car. As he went down the few
stairs and out to Kerim in the waiting Rolls, Bond
admitted to himself that he was disappointed.</p>

<p class="pindent">They were climbing up the far hill through the poorer
quarters above the Golden Horn when the chauffeur half
turned his head and said something in a non-committal
voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim answered with a monosyllable. ‘He says a
Lambretta is on our tail. A Faceless One. It is of no
importance. When I wish, I can make a secret of my
movements. Often they have trailed this car for miles
when there has been only a dummy in the back. A
conspicuous car has its uses. They know this gipsy is a
friend of mine, but I think they do not understand why.
It will do no harm for them to know that we are having
a night of relaxation. On a Saturday night, with a friend
from England, anything else would be unusual.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked back through the rear window and
watched the crowded streets. From behind a stopped
tram a motor scooter showed for a minute and then
was hidden by a taxi. Bond turned away. He reflected
briefly on the way the Russians ran their centres—with
all the money and equipment in the world, while the
Secret Service put against them a handful of adventurous,
underpaid men, like this one, with his second-hand
Rolls and his children to help him. Yet Kerim had the
run of Turkey. Perhaps, after all, the right man was
better than the right machine.</p>

<p class="pindent">At half past eight they stopped half way up a long
hill on the outskirts of Istanbul at a dingy-looking
open-air café with a few empty tables on the pavement.
Behind it were the tops of trees over a high stone wall.
They got out and the car drove off. They waited for
the Lambretta, but its wasp-like buzz had stopped and
at once it was on its way back down the hill. All they
saw of the driver was a glimpse of a short squat man
wearing goggles.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim led the way through the tables and into the
café. It seemed empty, but a man rose up quickly from
behind the till. He kept one hand below the counter.
When he saw who it was, he gave Kerim a nervous
white smile. Something clanged to the floor. He stepped
from behind the counter and led them out through the
back and across a stretch of gravel to a door in the
high wall and, after knocking once, unlocked it and
waved them through.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was an orchard with plank tables dotted about
under the trees. In the centre was a circle of terrazza
dancing floor. Round it were strung fairy lights, now
dead, on poles planted in the ground. On the far side,
at a long table, about twenty people of all ages had
been sitting eating, but they had put down their knives
and now looked towards the door. Some children had
been playing in the grass behind the table. They also
were now quiet and watching. The three-quarter moon
showed everything up brightly and made pools of
membraned shadow under the trees.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim and Bond walked forward. The man at the
head of the table said something to the others. He got
up and came to meet them. The rest returned to their
dinner and the children to their games.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man greeted Kerim with reserve. He stood for a
few moments making a long explanation to which Kerim
listened attentively, occasionally asking a question.</p>

<p class="pindent">The gipsy was an imposing, theatrical figure in Macedonian
dress—white shirt with full sleeves, baggy
trousers and laced soft leather top-boots. His hair was
a tangle of black snakes. A large downward-drooping
black moustache almost hid the full red lips. The eyes
were fierce and cruel on either side of a syphilitic nose.
The moon glinted on the sharp line of the jaw and the
high cheekbones. His right hand, which had a gold ring
on the thumb, rested on the hilt of a short curved
dagger in a leather scabbard tipped with filigree silver.</p>

<p class="pindent">The gipsy finished talking. Kerim said a few words,
forceful and apparently complimentary, about Bond, at
the same time stretching his hand out in Bond’s direction
as if he was a compère in a nightclub commending
a new turn. The gipsy stepped up to Bond and scrutinized
him. He bowed abruptly. Bond followed suit. The
gipsy said a few words through a sardonic smile. Kerim
laughed and turned to Bond. ‘He says if you are ever
out of work you should come to him. He will give you
a job—taming his women and killing for him. That is a
great compliment to a <span class="it">gajo</span>—a foreigner. You should
say something in reply.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Tell him that I can’t imagine he needs any help in
these matters.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim translated. The gipsy politely bared his teeth.
He said something and walked back to the table, clapping
his hands sharply. Two women got up and came
towards him. He spoke to them curtly and they went
back to the table and picked up a large earthenware
dish and disappeared among the trees.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim took Bond’s arm and led him to one side.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We have come on a bad night,’ he said. ‘The restaurant
is closed. There are family troubles here which have
to be solved—drastically, and in private. But I am an
old friend and we are invited to share their supper. It
will be disgusting but I have sent for raki. Then we
may watch—but on condition that we do not interfere.
I hope you understand, my friend.’ Kerim gave Bond’s
arm an additional pressure. ‘Whatever you see, you
must not move or comment. A court has just been
held and justice is to be done—their kind of justice.
It is an affair of love and jealousy. Two girls of the
tribe are in love with one of his sons. There is a lot
of death in the air. They both threaten to kill the other
to get him. If he chooses one, the unsuccessful one has
sworn to kill him and the girl. It is an <span class="it">impasse</span>. There is
much argument in the tribe. So the son has been sent
up into the hills and the two girls are to fight it out here
tonight—to the death. The son has agreed to take the
winner. The women are locked up in separate caravans.
It will not be for the squeamish, but it will be a remarkable
affair. It is a great privilege that we may be present.
You understand? We are gajos. You will forget your sense
of the proprieties? You will not interfere? They would
kill you, and possibly me, if you did.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Darko,’ said Bond. ‘I have a French friend. A man
called Mathis who is head of the Deuxième. He once
said to me: “<span class="it">J’aime les sensations fortes</span>.” I am like him. I
shall not disgrace you. Men fighting women is one thing.
Women fighting women is another. But what about the
bomb? The bomb that blew up your office. What did
he say about that?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It was the leader of the Faceless Ones. He put it
there himself. They came down the Golden Horn in a
boat and he climbed up a ladder and fixed it to the wall.
It was bad luck he didn’t get me. The operation was
well thought out. The man is a gangster. A Bulgarian
“refugee” called Krilencu. I shall have to have a reckoning
with him. God knows why they suddenly want
to kill me, but I cannot allow such annoyances. I may
decide to take action later tonight. I know where he
lives. In case Vavra knew the answer, I told my chauffeur
to come back with the necessary equipment.’</p>

<p class="pindent">A fiercely attractive young girl in a thick old-fashioned
black frock, with strings of gold coins round her neck
and about ten thin gold bracelets on each wrist, came
over from the table and swept a low jingling curtsey in
front of Kerim. She said something and Kerim
replied.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We are bidden to the table,’ said Kerim. ‘I hope you
are good at eating with your fingers. I see they are all
wearing their smartest clothes tonight. That girl would
be worth marrying. She has a lot of gold on her. It is
her dowry.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They walked over to the table. Two places had been
cleared on either side of the head gipsy. Kerim gave
what sounded like a polite greeting to the table. There
was a curt nod of acknowledgment. They sat down. In
front of each of them was a large plate of some sort
of ragout smelling strongly of garlic, a bottle of raki,
a pitcher of water and a cheap tumbler. More bottles
of raki, untouched, were on the table. When Kerim
reached for his and poured himself half a tumblerful,
everyone followed suit. Kerim added some water and
raised his glass. Bond did the same. Kerim made a short
and vehement speech and all raised their glasses and
drank. The atmosphere became easier. An old woman
next to Bond passed him a long loaf of bread and said
something. Bond smiled and said ‘thank you’. He broke
off a piece and handed the loaf to Kerim who was
picking among his ragout with thumb and forefinger.
Kerim took the loaf with one hand and at the same
time, with the other, he put a large piece of meat in
his mouth and began to eat.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was about to do the same when Kerim said
sharply and quietly, ‘With the right hand, James. The
left hand is used for only one purpose among these
people.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond halted his left hand in mid-air and moved it on
to grasp the nearest raki bottle. He poured himself
another half tumblerful and started to eat with his right
hand. The ragout was delicious but steaming hot. Bond
winced each time he dipped his fingers into it. Everyone
watched them eat and from time to time the old woman
dipped her fingers into Bond’s stew and chose a piece
for him.</p>

<p class="pindent">When they had scoured their plates, a silver bowl of
water, in which rose leaves floated, and a clean linen
cloth, were put between Bond and Kerim. Bond washed
his fingers and his greasy chin and turned to his host
and dutifully made a short speech of thanks which
Kerim translated. The table murmured its appreciation.
The head gipsy bowed towards Bond and said, according
to Kerim, that he hated all gajos except Bond, whom
he was proud to call his friend. Then he clapped his
hands sharply and everybody got up from the table and
began pulling the benches away and arranging them
round the dance floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim came round the table to Bond. They walked
off together. ‘How do you feel? They’ve gone to get
the two girls.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond nodded. He was enjoying the evening. The
scene was beautiful and thrilling—the white moon
blazing down on the ring of figures now settling on
the benches, the glint of gold or jewellery as somebody
shifted his position, the glaring pool of terrazza and,
all around, the quiet, sentinel trees standing guard in
their black skirts of shadow.</p>

<p class="pindent">Kerim led Bond to a bench where the chief gipsy sat
alone. They took their places on his right.</p>

<p class="pindent">A black cat with green eyes walked slowly across the
terrazza and joined a group of children who were sitting
quietly as if someone was about to come on to the
dance floor and teach them a lesson. It sat down and
began licking its chest.</p>

<p class="pindent">Beyond the high wall, a horse neighed. Two of the
gipsies looked over their shoulders towards the sound
as if they were reading the cry of the horse. From the
road came the silvery spray of a bicycle bell as someone
sped down the hill.</p>

<p class="pindent">The crouching silence was broken by the clang of a
bolt being drawn. The door in the wall crashed back
and two girls, spitting and fighting like angry cats, hurtled
through and across the grass and into the ring.</p>
