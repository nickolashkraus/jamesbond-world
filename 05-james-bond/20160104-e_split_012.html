<p class="pindent">Sitting by the window of her one room and looking
out at the serene June evening, at the first pink of the
sunset reflected in the windows across the street, at the
distant onion spire of a church that flamed like a torch
above the ragged horizon of Moscow roofs, Corporal
of State Security Tatiana Romanova thought that she
was happier than she had ever been before.</p>

<p class="pindent">Her happiness was not romantic. It had nothing to
do with the rapturous start to a love affair—those days
and weeks before the first tiny tear-clouds appear on
the horizon. It was the quiet, settled happiness of security,
of being able to look forward with confidence to the
future, heightened by the immediate things, a word of
praise she had had that afternoon from Professor
Denikin, the smell of a good supper cooking on the
electric stove, her favourite prelude to <span class="it">Boris Goudonov</span>
being played by the Moscow State Orchestra on the
radio, and, over all, the beauty of the fact that the long
winter and short spring were past and it was June.</p>

<p class="pindent">The room was a tiny box in the huge modern apartment
building on the Sadovaya-Chernogriazskay Ulitza
that is the women’s barracks of the State Security Departments.
Built by prison labour, and finished in 1939, the
fine eight-storey building contains two thousand rooms,
some, like hers on the third floor, nothing but square
boxes with a telephone, hot and cold water, a single
electric light and a share of the central bathrooms and
lavatories, others, on the two top floors, consisting of
two- and three-room flats with bathrooms. These were
for high-ranking women. Graduation up the building
was strictly by rank, and Corporal Romanova had to
rise through Sergeant, Lieutenant, Captain, Major and
Lieutenant-Colonel before she would reach the paradise
of the eighth and Colonels’ floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">But heaven knew she was content enough with her
present lot. A salary of 1200 roubles a month (thirty
per cent more than she could have earned in any other
Ministry), a room to herself; cheap food and clothes
from the ‘closed shops’ on the ground floor of the
building; a monthly allocation of at least two Ministry
tickets to the Ballet or the Opera; a full two weeks’ paid
holiday a year. And, above all, a steady job with good
prospects in Moscow—not in one of those dreary
provincial towns where nothing happened month after
month, and where the arrival of a new film or the visit
of a travelling circus was the only thing to keep one
out of bed in the evening.</p>

<p class="pindent">Of course, you had to pay for being in the MGB.
The uniform put you apart from the world. People were
afraid, which didn’t suit the nature of most girls, and
you were confined to the society of other MGB girls
and men, one of whom, when the time came, you would
have to marry in order to stay with the Ministry. And
they worked like the devil—eight to six, five and a half
days a week, and only forty minutes off for lunch in
the canteen. But it was a good lunch, a real meal, and
you could do with little supper and save up for the sable
coat that would one day take the place of the well-worn
Siberian fox.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the thought of her supper, Corporal Romanova
left the chair by the window and went to examine the
pot of thick soup, with a few shreds of meat and some
powdered mushroom, that was to be her supper. It was
nearly done and smelled delicious. She turned off the
electricity and let the pot simmer while she washed and
tidied, as, years before, she had been taught to do before
meals.</p>

<p class="pindent">While she dried her hands, she examined herself in
the big oval looking-glass over the washstand.</p>

<p class="pindent">One of her early boy-friends had said she looked like
the young Greta Garbo. What nonsense! And yet tonight
she did look rather well. Fine dark brown silken hair
brushed straight back from a tall brow and falling heavily
down almost to the shoulders, there to curl slightly up
at the ends (Garbo had once done her hair like that
and Corporal Romanova admitted to herself that she
had copied it), a good, soft pale skin with an ivory sheen
at the cheekbones; wide apart, level eyes of the deepest
blue under straight natural brows (she closed one eye
after the other. Yes, her lashes were certainly long
enough!) a straight, rather imperious nose—and then
the mouth. What about the mouth? Was it too broad?
It must look terribly wide when she smiled. She smiled
at herself in the mirror. Yes, it was wide; but then so
had Garbo’s been. At least the lips were full and finely
etched. There was the hint of a smile at the corners.
No one could say it was a cold mouth! And the oval
of her face. Was that too long? Was her chin a shade
too sharp? She swung her head sideways to see it in
profile. The heavy curtain of hair swung forward and
across her right eye so that she had to brush it back.
Well, the chin was pointed, but at least it wasn’t sharp.
She faced the mirror again and picked up a brush
and started on the long, heavy hair. Greta Garbo! She
was all right, or so many men wouldn’t tell her that
she was—let alone the girls who were always coming
to her for advice about their faces. But a film star—a
famous one! She made a face at herself in the glass and
went to eat her supper.</p>

<p class="pindent">In fact Corporal Tatiana Romanova was a very beautiful
girl indeed. Apart from her face, the tall, firm
body moved particularly well. She had been a year in
the ballet school in Leningrad and had abandoned
dancing as a career only when she grew an inch over
the prescribed limit of five feet six. The school had
taught her to hold herself well and to walk well. And
she looked wonderfully healthy, thanks to her passion
for figure-skating, which she practised all through the
year at the Dynamo ice-stadium and which had already
earned her a place on the first Dynamo women’s team.
Her arms and breasts were faultless. A purist would
have disapproved of her behind. Its muscles were so
hardened with exercise that it had lost the smooth
downward feminine sweep, and now, round at the
back and flat and hard at the sides, it jutted like a
man’s.</p>

<p class="pindent">Corporal Romanova was admired far beyond the
confines of the English translation section of the MGB
Central Index. Everyone agreed that it would not be
long before one of the senior officers came across her
and peremptorily hauled her out of her modest section
to make her his mistress, or if absolutely necessary, his
wife.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl poured the thick soup into a small china
bowl, decorated with wolves chasing a galloping sleigh
round the rim, broke some black bread into it and went
and sat in her chair by the window and ate it slowly
with a nice shiny spoon she had slipped into her bag
not many weeks before after a gay evening at the Hotel
Moskwa.</p>

<p class="pindent">When she had finished, she washed up and went
back to her chair and lit the first cigarette of the day
(no respectable girl in Russia smokes in public, except
in a restaurant, and it would have meant instant
dismissal if she had smoked at her work) and listened
impatiently to the whimpering discords of an orchestra
from Turkmenistan. This dreadful Oriental stuff they
were always putting on to please the kulaks of one of
those barbaric outlying states! Why couldn’t they play
something <span class="it">kulturny</span>? Some of that modern jazz music,
or something classical. This stuff was hideous. Worse,
it was old-fashioned.</p>

<p class="pindent">The telephone rang harshly. She walked over and
turned down the radio and picked up the receiver.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Corporal Romanova?’</p>

<p class="pindent">It was the voice of her dear Professor Denikin. But
out of office hours he always called her Tatiana or even
Tania. What did this mean?</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl was wide-eyed and tense. ‘Yes, Comrade
Professor.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The voice at the other end sounded strange and cold.
‘In fifteen minutes, at 8.30, you are required for interview
by Comrade Colonel Klebb, of Otdyel II. You
will call on her in her apartment, No1875, on the eighth
floor of your building. Is that clear?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But, Comrade, why? What is . . . What is . . . ?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The odd, strained voice of her beloved Professor cut
her short.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That is all, Comrade Corporal.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl held the receiver away from her face. She
stared at it with frenzied eyes as if she could wring
more words out of the circles of little holes in the black
earpiece. ‘Hullo! Hullo!’ The empty mouthpiece yawned
at her. She realized that her hand and her forearm were
aching with the strength of her grip. She bent slowly
forward and put the receiver down on the cradle.</p>

<p class="pindent">She stood for a moment, frozen, gazing blindly at
the black machine. Should she call him back? No, that
was out of the question. He had spoken as he had
because he knew, and she knew, that every call, in and
out of the building, was listened to or recorded. That
was why he had not wasted a word. This was a State
matter. With a message of this sort, you got rid of
it as quickly as you could, in as few words as possible,
and wiped your hands of it. You had got the dreadful
card out of your hand. You had passed the Queen
of Spades to someone else. Your hands were clean
again.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl put her knuckles up to her open mouth and
bit on them, staring at the telephone. What did they
want her for? What had she done? Desperately she cast
her mind back, scrabbling through the days, the months,
the years. Had she made some terrible mistake in her
work and they had just discovered it? Had she made
some remark against the State, some joke that had been
reported back? That was always possible. But which
remark? When? If it had been a bad remark, she would
have felt a twinge of guilt or fear at the time. Her
conscience was clear. Or was it? Suddenly she remembered.
What about the spoon she had stolen? Was it
that? Government property! She would throw it out of
the window, now, far to one side or the other. But no,
it couldn’t be that. That was too small. She shrugged
her shoulders resignedly and her hand dropped to her
side. She got up and moved towards the clothes
cupboard to get out her best uniform, and her eyes
were misty with the tears of fright and bewilderment
of a child. It could be none of those things, <span class="sc">smersh</span>
didn’t send for one for that sort of thing. It must be
something much, much worse.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl glanced through her wet eyes at the cheap
watch on her wrist. Only seven minutes to go! A new
panic seized her. She brushed her forearm across her
eyes and grabbed down her parade uniform. On top
of it all, whatever it was, to be late! She tore at the
buttons of her white cotton blouse.</p>

<p class="pindent">As she dressed and washed her face and brushed her
hair, her mind went on probing at the evil mystery like
an inquisitive child poking into a snake’s hole with a
stick. From whatever angle she explored the hole, there
came an angry hiss.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leaving out the nature of her guilt, contact with any
tentacle of <span class="sc">smersh</span> was unspeakable. The very name
of the organization was abhorred and avoided. <span class="sc">smersh</span>,
‘Smiert Spionam’, ‘Death to Spies’. It was an obscene
word, a word from the tomb, the very whisper of death,
a word never mentioned even in secret office gossip
among friends. Worst of all, within this horrible organization,
Otdyel II, the Department of Torture and
Death, was the central horror.</p>

<p class="pindent">And the Head of Otdyel II, the woman, Rosa Klebb!
Unbelievable things were whispered about this woman,
things that came to Tatiana in her nightmares, things she
forgot again during the day, but that she now paraded.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was said that Rosa Klebb would let no torturing
take place without her. There was a blood-spattered
smock in her office, and a low camp-stool, and they
said that when she was seen scurrying through the
basement passages dressed in the smock and with the
stool in her hand, the word would go round, and even
the workers in <span class="sc">smersh</span> would hush their words and
bend low over their papers—perhaps even cross their
fingers in their pockets—until she was reported back
in her room.</p>

<p class="pindent">For, or so they whispered, she would take the camp-stool
and draw it up close below the face of the man
or woman that hung down over the edge of the interrogation
table. Then she would squat down on the stool
and look into the face and quietly say ‘No1’ or ‘No10’ or
‘No25’ and the inquisitors would know what she meant
and they would begin. And she would watch the eyes
in the face a few inches away from hers and breathe
in the screams as if they were perfume. And, depending
on the eyes, she would quietly change the torture, and
say ‘Now No36’ or ‘Now No64’ and the inquisitors
would do something else. As the courage and resistance
seeped out of the eyes, and they began to weaken and
beseech, she would start cooing softly. ‘There, there my
dove. Talk to me, my pretty one, and it will stop. It
hurts. Ah me, it hurts so, my child. And one is so tired
of the pain. One would like it to stop, and to be able
to lie down in peace, and for it never to begin again.
Your mother is here beside you, only waiting to stop
the pain. She has a nice soft cosy bed all ready for you
to sleep on and forget, forget, forget. Speak,’ she would
whisper lovingly. ‘You have only to speak and you will
have peace and no more pain.’ If the eyes still resisted,
the cooing would start again. ‘But you are foolish, my
pretty one. Oh so foolish. This pain is nothing. Nothing!
You don’t believe me, my little dove? Well then, your
mother must try a little, but only a very little, of No87.’
And the interrogators would hear and change their
instruments and their aim, and she would squat there
and watch the life slowly ebbing from the eyes until she
had to speak loudly into the ear of the person or the
words would not reach the brain.</p>

<p class="pindent">But it was seldom, so they said, that the person had
the will to travel far along <span class="sc">smersh</span>’s road of pain, let alone
to the end, and, when the soft voice promised peace, it
nearly always won, for somehow Rosa Klebb knew from
the eyes the moment when the adult had been broken
down into a child crying for its mother. And she provided
the image of the mother and melted the spirit where the
harsh words of a man would have toughened it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then, after yet another suspect had been broken,
Rosa Klebb would go back down the passage with her
camp-stool and take off her newly soiled smock and get
back to her work and the word would go round that
all was over and normal activity would come back to
the basement.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tatiana, frozen by her thoughts, looked again at her
watch. Four minutes to go. She ran her hands down
her uniform and gazed once more at her white face in
the glass. She turned and said farewell to the dear,
familiar little room. Would she ever see it again?</p>

<p class="pindent">She walked straight down the long corridor and rang
for the lift.</p>

<p class="pindent">When it came, she squared her shoulders and lifted
her chin and walked into the lift as if it was the platform
of the guillotine.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Eighth,’ she said to the girl operator. She stood facing
the doors. Inside her, remembering a word she had not
used since childhood, she repeated over and over ‘My
God—My God—My God.’</p>
