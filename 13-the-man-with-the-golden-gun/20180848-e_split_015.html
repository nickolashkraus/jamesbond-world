<p class="line9">In the back office, James Bond went quickly over the
highlights of the meeting. Nick Nicholson and Felix
Leiter agreed they had enough on the tape, supported
by Bond, to send Scaramanga to the chair. That night,
one of them would do some snooping while the body of
Rotkopf was being disposed of and try and get enough
evidence to have Garfinkel and, better still, Hendriks
indicted as accessories. But they didn’t at all like the outlook
for James Bond. Felix commanded him, “Now
don’t you move an inch without that old equalizer of
yours. We don’t want to have to read that obituary of
yours in <span class="it">The Times</span> all over again. All that crap about
what a great guy you are nearly made me throw up when
I saw it picked up in our papers. I damn nearly fired off
a piece to the <span class="it">Trib</span> putting the record straight.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. He said, “You’re a fine friend, Felix.
When I think of all the trouble I’ve been to to set you a
good example all these years.” He went off to his room,
swallowed two heavy slugs of bourbon, had a cold
shower, and lay on his bed and looked at the ceiling until
it was 8:30 and time for dinner. The meal was less
stuffy than luncheon. Everyone seemed satisfied with the
way the business of the day had gone, and all except
Scaramanga and Mr. Hendriks had obviously had plenty
to drink. Bond found himself excluded from the happy
talk. Eyes avoided his and replies to his attempts at conversation
were monosyllabic. He was bad news. He had
been dealt the death card by the boss. He was certainly
not a man to be pally with.</p>

<p class="pindent">Dinner—the conventional “expensive” dinner of a
cruise ship—was as predictable as such things usually are.
The waiters brought on the desiccated smoked salmon
with a thimbleful of small-grained black caviar, fillets of
some unnamed native fish (possibly silk fish) in a cream
sauce, a “<span class="it">poulet suprême</span>” (a badly roasted broiler with
a thick gravy), and the <span class="it">bombe surprise</span>. And while the
meal moved sluggishly on, the dining-room was being
turned into a “tropical jungle” with the help of potted
plants, piles of oranges and coconuts, and an occasional
stem of bananas—this was a backdrop for the calypso
band, which, in wine-red and gold-frilled shirts, assembled
in due course and began playing “Linstead Market”
too loud. The tune closed. An acceptable but heavily
clad girl appeared and began singing “Belly-Lick”
with the printable words. She wore a false pineapple as a
headdress. Bond saw a “cruise ship” evening stretching
ahead. He decided that he was either too old or too
young for the worst torture of all, boredom, and got up
and went to the head of the table. He said to Scaramanga,
“I’ve got a headache. I’m going to bed.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga looked up at him under lizard eyelids.
“No. If you figure the evening’s not going so good,
make it go better. That’s what you’re being paid for.
You act as if you know Jamaica. Okay. Get these people
off the pad.”</p>

<p class="pindent">It was many years since James Bond had accepted a
dare. He felt the eyes of The Group on him. What he
had drunk had made him careless—perhaps wanting to
show off, like the man at the party who insists on playing
the drums. Stupidly, he wanted to assert his personality
over this bunch of tough guys who rated him insignificant.
He didn’t stop to think that it was bad tactics, that
he would be better off being the ineffectual limey. He
said, “All right, Mr. Scaramanga. Give me a hundred
dollar bill and your gun.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga didn’t move. He looked up at Bond with
surprise and controlled uncertainty. Louie Paradise
shouted thickly, “C’mon, Pistols! Let’s see some action!
Maybe the guy can produce.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga reached for his hip pocket, took out his
billfold, and thumbed out a bill. Next he slowly reached
to his waistband and took out his gun. The subdued
light from the spot on the girl glowed on its gold. He
laid the two objects on the table side by side. James
Bond, his back to the cabaret, picked up the gun and
hefted it. He thumbed back the hammer and twirled the
cylinder with a flash of his hands to verify that it was
loaded. Then he suddenly whirled, dropped on his knee
so that his aim would be above the shadowy musicians in
the background, and, his arm at full length, let fly. The
explosion was deafening in the confined space. The music
died. There was a tense silence. The remains of the
false pineapple hit something in the dark background
with a soft thud. The girl stood under the spot and put
her hands up to her face and slowly folded to the dance
floor like something graceful out of <span class="it">Swan Lake</span>. The
maître d’hôtel came running from among the shadows.</p>

<p class="pindent">As chatter broke out among The Group, James Bond
picked up the hundred dollar bill and walked out into
the spotlight. He bent down and lifted the girl up by her
arm. He pushed the bill down into her cleavage. He
said, “That was a fine act we did together, sweetheart.
Don’t worry. You were in no danger. I aimed for the top
half of the pineapple. Now run off and get ready for
your next turn.” He turned her round and gave her a
sharp pat on the behind. She gave him a horrified glance
and scurried off into the shadows.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond strolled on and came up with the band. “Who’s
in charge here? Who’s in command of the show?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The guitarist, a tall, gaunt Negro, got slowly to his
feet. The whites of his eyes showed. He squinted at the
golden gun in Bond’s hand. He said uncertainly, as if
signing his own death warrant, “Me, sah.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What’s your name?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“King Tiger, sah.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“All right then, King. Now listen to me. This isn’t a
Salvation Army fork supper. Mr. Scaramanga’s friends
want some action. And they want it hot. I’ll be sending
plenty of rum over to loosen things up. Smoke weed if
you like. We’re private here. No one’s going to tell on
you. And get that pretty girl back, but with only half the
clothes on, and tell her to come up close and sing “Belly-Lick”
very clearly with the blue words. And, by the end
of the show, she and the other girls have got to end up
stripped. Understand? Now get cracking, or the evening’ll
fold and there’ll be no tips at the end. Okay?
Then let’s go.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was nervous laughter and whispered exhortation
to King Tiger from the six-piece combo. King Tiger
grinned broadly. “Okay, captain, sah. We was just
holding off until the party got warmed up a little.” He
turned to his men. “Give ’em ‘Iron Bar,’ but hot. And
I’ll go get some steam up with Daisy and her friends.”
He strode to the service exit and the band crashed into
its stride.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked back and laid the pistol down in front of
Scaramanga, who gave Bond a long, inquisitive look and
slid it back into his waistband. He said flatly, “We must
have a shooting match one of these days, mister. How
about it? Twenty paces and no wounding?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thanks,” said Bond, “but my mother wouldn’t approve.
Would you have some rum sent over to the band?
These people can’t play dry.” He went back to his seat.
He was hardly noticed. The five men, or rather four of
them, because Hendriks sat impassively through the
whole evening, were straining their ears to catch the
lewd words of the Fanny Hill version of “Iron Bar” that
were coming across clearly from the soloist. Four girls,
plump, busty little animals wearing nothing but white
sequined G-strings, ran out onto the floor, and advancing
towards the audience, did an enthusiastic belly dance
that brought sweat to the temples of Louie Paradise and
Hal Garfinkel. The number ended amidst applause, the
girls ran off, and the lights were dowsed, leaving only the
circular spot in the middle of the floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">The drummer, on his calypso box, began a hasty beat
like a quickened pulse. The service door opened and
shut, and a curious object was wheeled into the circle of
light. It was a huge hand, perhaps six feet tall at its highest
point, upholstered in black leather. It stood, half
open on its broad base, with the thumb and fingers outstretched
as if ready to catch something. The drummer
hastened his beat. The service door sighed. A glistening
figure slipped through, and after pausing in the darkness,
moved into the pool of light round the hand with a
strutting jerk of belly and limbs. There was Chinese
blood in her, and her body, totally naked and shining
with palm oil, was almost white against the black hand.
As she jerked round the hand she caressed its outstretched
fingers with her hands and arms and then, with
well-acted swooning motions, climbed into the palm of
the hand and proceeded to perform languorous, but explicit
and ingenious, acts of passion with each of the fingers
in turn. The scene, the black hand, now shining
with her oil and seeming to clutch at the squirming
white body, was of an incredible lewdness, and Bond,
himself aroused, noticed that even Scaramanga was
watching with rapt attention, his eyes narrow slits. The
drummer had now worked up to his crescendo. The girl,
in well-simulated ecstasy, mounted the thumb, slowly
expired upon it, and then, with a last grind of her rump,
slid down it and vanished through the exit. The act was
over. The lights came on and everyone, including the
band, applauded loudly. The men came out of their separate
animal trances. Scaramanga clapped his hand for
the bandleader, took a note out of his case, and said
something to him under his breath. The chieftain, Bond
suspected, had chosen his bride for the night!</p>

<p class="pindent">After this inspired piece of sexual dumb crambo, the
rest of the carbaret was an anticlimax. One of the girls,
only after her G-string had been slashed off with a cutlass
by the bandleader, was able to squirm under a bamboo
pole balanced just eighteen inches off the floor on the
top of two beer bottles. The first girl, the one who had
acted as an unwitting pineapple tree to Bond’s William
Tell act, came on and combined an acceptable strip-tease
with a rendering of “Belly-Lick” that got the audience
straining its ears again, and then the whole team, less the
Chinese beauty, came up to the audience and invited
them to dance. Scaramanga and Hendriks refused with
adequate politeness and Bond stood the two left-out girls
glasses of champagne and learned that their names were
Mabel and Pearl while he watched the four others being
almost bent in half by the bearlike embraces of the four
sweating hoods as they clumsily cha-cha’d round the
room to the now riotous music of the half-drunk band.
The climax to what could certainly class as an orgy was
clearly in sight. Bond told his two girls that he must go
to the men’s room and slipped away when Scaramanga
was looking elsewhere, but, as he went, he noted that
Hendriks’ gaze, as cool as if he had been watching an
indifferent film, was firmly on him as he made his escape.</p>

<p class="pindent">When Bond got to his room, it was midnight. His
windows had been closed and the air-conditioning
turned on. He switched it off and opened the windows
halfway and then, with heartfelt relief, took a shower
and went to bed. He worried for a while about having
shown off with the gun, but it was an act of folly which
he couldn’t undo, and he soon went to sleep to dream of
three black-cloaked men dragging a shapeless bundle
through dappled moonlight towards dark waters that
were dotted with glinting red eyes. The gnashing white
teeth and the crackling bones resolved themselves into a
persistent scrabbling noise that brought him suddenly
awake. He looked at the luminous dial of his watch. It
said 3:30. The scrabbling became a quiet tapping from
behind the curtains. James Bond slid quietly out of bed,
took his gun from under his pillow, and crept softly
along the wall to the edge of the curtains. He pulled
them aside with one swift motion. The golden hair
shone almost silver in the moonlight. Mary Goodnight
whispered urgently, “Quick, James! Help me in!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond cursed softly to himself. What the hell? He laid
his gun down on the carpet and reached for her outstretched
hands and half-dragged, half-pulled her over
the sill. At the last moment, her heel caught in the frame
and the window banged shut with a noise like a pistol
shot. Bond cursed again, softly and fluently, under his
breath. Mary Goodnight whispered penitently, “I’m terribly
sorry, James.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shushed her. He picked up his gun and put it
back under his pillow and led her across the room and
into the bathroom. He turned on the light and, as a precaution,
the shower, and, simultaneously with her gasp,
remembered he was naked. He said, “Sorry, Goodnight,”
and reached for a towel and wound it round his
waist and sat down on the edge of the bath. He gestured
to the girl to sit down on the lavatory seat and said, with
icy control, “What in hell are you doing here, Mary?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Her voice was desperate. “I had to come. I had to find
you somehow. I got on to you through the girl at that,
er, dreadful place. I left the car in the trees down the
drive and just sniffed about. There were lights on in
some of the rooms and I listened and, er”—she blushed
crimson—“I gathered you couldn’t be in any of them
and then I saw the open window, and I just somehow
knew you would be the only one to sleep with his window
open. So I just had to take the chance.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, we’ve got to get you out of here as quick as we
can. Anyway, what’s the trouble?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“A Most Immediate in Triple-X came over this evening.
I mean yesterday evening. It was to be passed to
you at all costs. H.Q. thinks you’re in Havana. It said
that one of the K.G.B. top men who goes under the
name of Hendriks is in the area and that he’s known to
be visiting this hotel. You’re to keep away from him.
They know from A Delicate But Sure Source”—Bond
smiled at the old euphemism for cypher-breaking—“that
among his other jobs is to find you and, er, well, kill you.
So I put two and two together, and, what with you being
in this corner of the island and the questions you asked
me, I guessed that you might be already on his track but
that you might be walking into an ambush, sort of. Not
knowing, I mean, that while you were after him, he was
after you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She put out a tentative hand, as if for reassurance that
she had done the right thing. Bond took it and patted it
absent-mindedly while his mind chewed on this new
complication. He said, “The man’s here all right. So’s a
gunman called Scaramanga. You might as well know,
Mary, that Scaramanga killed Ross. In Trinidad.” She
put her hand up to her mouth. “You can report it as a
fact, from me. If I can get you out of here, that is. As for
Hendriks, he’s here all right, but he doesn’t seem to have
identified me for certain. Did H.Q. say whether he was
given a description of me?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You were simply described as ‘the notorious secret
agent, James Bond.’ But this doesn’t seem to have
meant much to Hendriks because he asked for particulars.
That was two days ago. He may get them cabled or
telephoned here at any minute. You do see why I had to
come, James?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, of course. And thanks, Mary. Now, I’ve got to
get you out of that window, and then you must just
make your own way. Don’t worry about me. I think I
can handle the situation all right. Besides, I’ve got
help.” He told her about Felix Leiter and Nicholson.
“You just tell H.Q. you’ve delivered the message and
that I’m here and about the two C.I.A. men. H.Q. can
get the C.I.A. angles from Washington direct. Okay?”
He got to his feet.</p>

<p class="pindent">She stood up beside him and looked up at him. “But
you will take care?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sure, sure.” He patted her shoulder. He turned off
the shower and opened the bathroom door. “Now, come
on. We must pray for a stroke of luck.”</p>

<p class="pindent">A silken voice from the darkness at the end of the bed
said, “Well, the Holy Man just ain’t running for you
today, mister. Step forward, both of you. Hands clasped
behind the neck.”</p>
