<p class="line9">The cars began rolling up. Scaramanga was in evidence.
He switched a careful smile of welcome on and off. No
hands were shaken. The host was greeted either as “Pistols”
or “Mr. S.” except by Mr. Hendriks, who called
him nothing.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stood within earshot of the desk and fitted the
names to the men. In general appearance they were all
much of a muchness. Dark-faced, clean-shaven, around
five feet six, hard-eyed above thinly smiling mouths, curt
of speech to the manager. They all held firmly on to
their briefcases when the bellboys tried to add them to
the luggage on the rubber-tyred barrows. They dispersed
to their rooms along the west wing. Bond took
out his list and added hatcheck notations to each one except
Hendriks, who was clearly etched in Bond’s memory.
Gengerella became “Italian origin, mean, pursed
mouth”; Rotkopf, “Thick neck, totally bald, Jew”;
Binion, “bat ears, scar down left cheek, limp”; Garfinkel,
“the toughest, bad teeth, gun under right armpit”;
and, finally, Paradise, “Showman type, cocky, false smile,
diamond ring.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga came up. “What’s that you’re writing?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Just notes to remember them by.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Let’s see it.” Scaramanga held out a demanding
hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gave him the list.</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga ran his eyes down it. He handed it back.
“Fair enough. But you needn’t have mentioned the only
gun you noticed. They’ll all be protected. These kinda
guys are nervous when they move abroad.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What of?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga shrugged. “Maybe the natives.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“The last people who worried about the natives were
the redcoats, perhaps a hundred and fifty years ago.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Who cares? See you in the bar around twelve. I’ll be
introducing you as my personal assistant.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’ll be fine.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga’s brows came together. Bond strolled off
in the direction of his bedroom. He proposed to needle
this man, and go on needling until it came to a fight. For
the time being, the other man would probably take it
because it seemed he needed Bond. But there would
come a moment, probably on an occasion when there
were witnesses, when his vanity would be so sharply
pricked that he would draw. Then Bond would have a
small edge, for it would be he who had thrown down the
glove. The tactic was a crude one, but Bond could think
of no other.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond verified that his room had been searched at some
time during the morning—and by an expert. He always
used a Hoffritz safety razor patterned on the old-fashioned
heavy-toothed Gillette type. His American friend
Felix Leiter had once bought him one in New York to
prove that they were the best, and Bond had stayed with
them. The handle of a safety razor is a reasonably sophisticated
hideout for the minor tools of espionage—codes,
microdot developers, cyanide, and other pills. That
morning Bond had set a minute nick on the screw base
of the handle in line with the “Z” of the maker’s name
engraved on the shaft. The nick was now a millimetre to
the right of the “Z.” None of his other little traps—handkerchiefs
with indelible dots in particular places arranged
in a certain order, the angle of his suitcase with
the wall of the wardrobe, the semi-extracted lining of
the breast pocket of his spare suit, the particular symmetry
of certain dents in his tube of Macleans toothpaste—had
been bungled or disturbed. They all might have
been by a meticulous servant, a trained valet. But Jamaican
servants, for all their charm and willingness, are not
of this calibre. No. Between nine and ten, when Bond
was doing his rounds and was well away from the hotel,
his room had received a thorough going-over by someone
who knew his business.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was pleased. It was good to know that the fight
was well and truly joined. If he found a chance of making
a foray into Number 20, he hoped that he would do
better. He took a shower. Afterwards, as he brushed his
hair, he looked at himself in the mirror with inquiry. He
was feeling a hundred percent fit, but he remembered
the dull, lacklustre eyes that had looked back at him
when he shaved after first entering The Park—the tense,
preoccupied expression on his face. Now the grey-blue
eyes looked back at him from the tanned face with the
brilliant glint of suppressed excitement and accurate focus
of the old days. He smiled ironically back at the introspective
scrutiny that so many people make of themselves
before a race, a contest of wits, a trial of some sort.
He had no excuses. He was ready to go.</p>

<p class="pindent">The bar was through a brass-studded leather door opposite
the lobby to the conference room. It was—in the
fashion—a mock-English public-house saloon bar with
luxury accessories. The scrubbed wooden chairs and
benches had foam-rubber squabs in red leather. Behind
the bar, the tankards were of silver, or simulated silver,
instead of pewter. The hunting prints, copper and brass
hunting horns, muskets and powder horns, on the walls
could have come from the Parker Galleries in London.
Instead of tankards of beer, bottles of champagne in antique
coolers stood on the tables and, instead of yokels,
the hoods stood around in what looked like Brooks
Brothers “tropical” attire and carefully sipped their
drinks while “Mine Host” leant against the polished mahogany
bar and twirled his golden gun round and round
on the first finger of his right hand like the snide poker
cheat out of an old Western.</p>

<p class="pindent">As the door closed behind Bond with a pressurized
sigh, the golden gun halted in midwhirl and sighted on
Bond’s stomach. “Fellows,” said Scaramanga, mock boisterous,
“meet my personal assistant, Mr. Mark Hazard,
from London, England. He’s come along to make things
run smoothly over this weekend. Mark, come over and
meet the gang and pass round the canapés.” He lowered
the gun and shoved it into his waistband.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond stitched a personal assistant smile on his
face and walked up to the bar. Perhaps because he was
an Englishman, there was a round of handshaking. The
red-coated barman asked him what he would have, and
he said, “Some pink gin. Plenty of bitters. Beefeater’s.”
There was desultory talk about the relative merits of
gins. Everyone else seemed to be drinking champagne
except Mr. Hendriks, who stood away from the group
and nursed a Schweppes Bitter Lemon. Bond moved
among the men. He made small talk about their flight,
the weather in the States, the beauties of Jamaica. He
wanted to fit the voices to the names. He gravitated towards
Mr. Hendriks. “Seems we’re the only two Europeans
here. Gather you’re from Holland. Often passed
through. Never stayed there long. Beautiful country.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The very pale blue eyes regarded Bond unenthusiastically.
“Sank you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What part do you come from?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Den Haag.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Have you lived there long?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Many, many years.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Beautiful town.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sank you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Is this your first visit to Jamaica?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“How do you like it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It is a beautiful place.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond nearly said “Sank you.” He smiled encouragingly
at Mr. Hendriks as much as to say, “I’ve made all
the running so far. Now you say something.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr. Hendriks looked past Bond’s right ear at nothing.
The pressure of the silence built up. Mr. Hendriks
shifted his weight from one foot to the other and finally
broke down. His eyes shifted and looked thoughtfully at
Bond. “And you. You are from London, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes. Do you know it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I have been there, yes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Where do you usually stay?”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was hesitation. “With friends.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That must be convenient.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Pliss?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I mean it’s pleasant to have friends in a foreign town.
Hotels are so much alike.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I have not found this. Excuse pliss.” With a Germanic
bob of the head, Mr. Hendriks moved decisively
away from Bond and went up to Scaramanga, who was
still lounging in solitary splendour at the bar. Mr. Hendriks
said something. His words acted like a command
on the other man. Scaramanga straightened himself and
followed Mr. Hendriks into a far corner of the room. He
stood and listened with deference as Mr. Hendriks
talked rapidly in a low tone.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond, joining the other men, was interested. It was his
guess that no other man in the room could have button-holed
Scaramanga with so much authority. He noticed
that many fleeting glances were cast in the direction of
the couple apart. For Bond’s money, this was either the
Mafia or K.G.B. Probably even the other five wouldn’t
know which, but they would certainly recognize the secret
smell of The Machine, which Mr. Hendriks exuded
so strongly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Luncheon was announced. The Jamaican headwaiter
hovered between two richly prepared tables. There were
place cards. Bond found that, while Scaramanga was host
at one of them, he himself was at the head of the other
table between Mr. Paradise and Mr. Rotkopf. As he expected,
Mr. Paradise was the better value of the two, and
as they went through the conventional shrimp cocktail,
steak, fruit salad of the Americanized hotel abroad,
Bond cheerfully got himself involved in an argument
about the odds at roulette when there are one zero or
two. Mr. Rotkopf’s only contribution was to say,
through a mouthful of steak and French fries, that he
had once tried three zeros at the Black Cat Casino in
Miami but that the experiment had failed. Mr. Paradise
said that so it should have. “You got to let the suckers
win sometimes, Ruby, or they won’t come back. Sure,
you can squeeze the juice out of them, but you oughta
leave them the pips. Like with my slots. I tell the customers,
don’t be too greedy. Don’t set ’em at thirty percent
for the house. Set ’em at twenty. You ever heard of
Mr. J. P. Morgan turning down a net profit of twenty
percent? Hell, no! So why try and be smarter than guys
like that?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr. Rotkopf said sourly, “You got to make big profits
to put against a bum steer like this.” He waved a hand.
“If you ask me”—he held up a bit of steak on his
fork—“you’re eating the only money you’re going to see
out of this dump at this minute.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr. Paradise leaned across the table and said softly,
“You know something?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr. Rotkopf said, “I always told my money that the
bindweed would get this place. The damn fools
wouldn’t listen. And look where we are in three years!
Second mortgage nearly run out, and we’ve only got one
storey up. What I say is. . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">The argument went off into the realms of high
finance. At the next-door table there was not even this
amount of animation. Scaramanga was a man of few
words. There were clearly none available for social occasions.
Opposite him, Mr. Hendriks exuded a silence as
thick as Gouda cheese. The three hoods addressed an occasional
glum sentence to anyone who would listen.
James Bond wondered how Scaramanga was going to
electrify this unpromising company into “having a good
time.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Luncheon broke up, and the company dispersed to
their rooms. James Bond wandered round to the back of
the hotel and found a discarded shingle on a rubbish
dump. It was blazing hot under the afternoon sun, but
the Doctor’s Wind was blowing in from the sea. For all
its air-conditioning, there was something grim about the
impersonal grey and white of Bond’s bedroom. Bond
walked along the shore, took off his coat and tie, and sat
in the shade of a bush of sea grapes and watched the fiddler
crabs about their minuscule business in the sand
while he whittled two chunky wedges out of the Jamaican
cedar. Then he closed his eyes and thought
about Mary Goodnight. She would now be having her
siesta in some villa on the outskirts of Kingston. It
would probably be high up in the Blue Mountains for
the coolness. In Bond’s imagination, she would be lying
on her bed under a mosquito net. Because of the heat,
she would have nothing on, and one could see only an
ivory-and-gold shape through the fabric of the net. But
one would know that there were small beads of sweat on
her upper lip and between her breasts, and the fringes of
the golden hair would be damp. Bond took off his
clothes and lifted up the corner of the mosquito net, not
wanting to wake her until he had fitted himself against
her thighs. But she turned, in half-sleep, towards him
and held out her arms. “James. . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">Under the sea-grape bush, a hundred and twenty
miles away from the scene of the dream, James Bond’s
head came up with a jerk. He looked quickly, guiltily, at
his watch. Three-thirty. He went off to his room and had
a cold shower, verified that his cedar wedges would do
what they were meant to do, and strolled down the corridor
to the lobby.</p>

<p class="pindent">The manager with the neat suit and neat face came
out from behind his desk. “Er, Mr. Hazard.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I don’t think you’ve met my assistant, Mr. Travis.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No, I don’t think I have.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Would you care to step into the office for a moment
and shake him by the hand?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Later perhaps. We’ve got this conference on in a few
minutes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The neat man came a step closer. He said quietly, “He
particularly wants to meet you, Mr.—er—Bond.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond cursed himself. This was always happening in
his particular trade. You were looking in the dark for a
beetle with red wings. Your eyes were focused for that
particular pattern on the bark of the tree. You didn’t
notice the moth with cryptic colouring that crouched
quietly nearby, itself like a piece of the bark, itself just as
important to the collector. The focus of your eyes was
too narrow. Your mind was too concentrated. You were
using 1 by 100 magnification, and your 1 by 10 was not
in focus. Bond looked at the man with the recognition
that exists between crooks, between homosexuals, between
secret agents. It is the look common to men
bound by secrecy—by common trouble. “Better make it
quick.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The neat man stepped behind his desk and opened a
door. Bond went in, and the neat man closed the door
behind them. A tall, slim man was standing at a filing
cabinet. He turned. He had a lean, bronzed Texan face
under an unruly mop of straight, fair hair, and, instead
of a right hand, a bright steel hook. Bond stopped in his
tracks. His face split into a smile broader than he had
smiled for what? Was it three years or four? He said,
“You goddamned lousy crook. What in hell are you doing
here?” He went up to the man and hit him hard on
the biceps of the left arm.</p>

<p class="pindent">The grin was slightly more creased than Bond remembered,
but it was just as friendly and ironical. “Mr.
Travis” said, “The name is Leiter, Mr. Felix Leiter.
Temporary accountant on loan from Morgan Guaranty
Trust to the Thunderbird Hotel. We’re just checking
up on your credit rating, Mr. Hazard. Would you
kindly, in your royal parlance, extract your finger, and
give me some evidence that you are who you claim to
be?”</p>
