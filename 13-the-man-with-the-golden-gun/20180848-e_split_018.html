<p class="line9">At twelve o’clock they all assembled in the lobby. Scaramanga
had added a broad-brimmed white Stetson to his
immaculate tropical attire. He looked like the smartest
plantation owner in the South. Mr. Hendriks wore his
usual stuffy suit, now topped with a grey Homburg.
Bond thought that he should have grey suede gloves and
an umbrella. The four hoods were wearing calypso shirts
outside their slacks. Bond was pleased. If they were
carrying guns in their waistbands, the shirts would hinder
the draw. Cars were drawn up outside, with Scaramanga’s
Thunderbird in the lead. Scaramanga walked
up to the desk. Nick Nicholson was standing washing his
hands in invisible soap and looking helpful. “All set?
Everything loaded on the train? Green Island been told?
Okay, then. Where’s that sidekick of yours, that man
Travis? Haven’t seen him around today.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Nick Nicholson looked serious. “He got an abscess in
his tooth, sir. Real bad. Had to send him in to Sav’ La
Mar to have it out. He’ll be okay by this afternoon.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Too bad. Dock him half a day’s pay. No room for
sleepers on this outfit. We’re shorthanded as it is. Should
have had his choppers attended to before he took the job
on. Okay?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Very good, Mr. Scaramanga. I’ll tell him.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga turned to the waiting group. “Okay, fellows,
here’s the picture. We drive a mile down the road
to the station. We get aboard this little train. Quite an
outfit, that. Fellow by the name of Lucius Beebe had it
copied for the Thunderbird company from the engine
and rolling stock on the little old Denver, South Park
and Pacific line. Okay. So we steam along this old canefield
line about twenty miles to Green Island Harbour.
Plenty birds, bush rats, crocs in the rivers. Maybe we get
a little hunting. Have some fun with the hardware. All
you guys got your guns with you? Fine, fine. Champagne
lunch at Green Island and the girls and the music’ll be
there to keep us happy. After lunch we get aboard the
<span class="it">Thunder Bird</span>, big Chris-Craft, and take a cruise along to
Lucea, that’s a little township up the coast, and see if we
can catch our dinner. Those that don’t want to fish can
play stud. Right? Then back here for drinks. Okay?
Everyone satisfied? Any suggestions? Then let’s go.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was told to get in the back of the car. They set
off. Once again that offered neck! Crazy not to take him
now! But it was open country with no cover and there
were five guns riding behind. The odds simply weren’t
good enough. What was the plan for his removal? During
the “hunting” presumably. James Bond smiled
grimly to himself. He was feeling happy. He wouldn’t
have been able to explain the emotion. It was a feeling
of being keyed up, wound taut. It was the moment, after
twenty passes, when you got a hand you could bet on—not
necessarily win, but bet on. He had been after this
man for over six weeks. Today, this morning perhaps,
was to come the payoff he had been ordered to bring
about. It was win or lose. The odds? Foreknowledge was
playing for him. He was more heavily forearmed than
the enemy knew. But the enemy had the big battalions
on their side. There were more of them. And, taking
only Scaramanga, perhaps more talent. Weapons? Again
leaving out the others, Scaramanga had the advantage.
The long-barrelled Colt .45 would be a fraction slower
on the draw, but its length of barrel would give it
more accuracy than the Walther automatic. Rate of
fire? The Walther should have the edge—and the first
empty chamber of Scaramanga’s gun, if it hadn’t been
discovered, would be an additional bonus. The steady
hand? The cool brain? The sharpness of the lust to kill?
How did they weigh up? Probably nothing to choose on
the first two. Bond might be a shade trigger-happy—of
necessity. That he must watch. He must damp down the
fire in his belly. Get ice-cold. In the lust to kill, perhaps
he was the strongest. Of course. He was fighting for his
life. The other man was just amusing himself—providing
sport for his friends, displaying his potency, showing off.
That was good! That might be decisive! Bond said to
himself that he must increase the other man’s unawareness,
his casual certitude, his lack of caution. He must be
the P. G. Wodehouse Englishman, the limey of the cartoons.
He must play easy to take. The adrenalin coursed
into James Bond’s bloodstream. His pulse rate began to
run a fraction high. He felt it on his wrist. He breathed
deeply and slowly to bring it down. He found that he
was sitting forward, tensed. He sat back and tried to relax.
All of his body relaxed except his right hand. This
was in the control of someone else. Resting on his right
thigh, it still twitched slightly from time to time like the
paw of a sleeping dog chasing rabbits.</p>

<p class="pindent">He put it into his coat pocket and watched a turkey
buzzard a thousand feet up, circling. He put himself into
the mind of the John Crow, watching out for a squashed
toad or a dead bush rat. The circling buzzard had found
its offal. It came lower and lower. Bond wished it <span class="it">bon
appétit</span>. The predator in him wished the scavenger a
good meal. He smiled at the comparison between them.
They were both following a scent. The main difference
was that the John Crow was a protected bird. No one
would shoot back at it when it made its final dive.
Amused by his thoughts, Bond’s right hand came out of
his pocket and lit a cigarette for him, quietly and obediently.
It had stopped going off chasing rabbits on its
own.</p>

<p class="pindent">The station was a brilliant mockup from the Colorado
narrow-gauge era—a low building in faded clapboard ornamented
with gingerbread along its eaves. Its name,
Thunderbird Halt, was in old-style ornamental type,
heavily seriffed. Advertisements proclaimed <span class="calibre2">CHEW ROSELEAF
FINE CUT WARRANTED FINEST VIRGINIA LEAF,
TRAINS STOP FOR ALL MEALS, NO CHECKS ACCEPTED.</span> The
engine, gleaming in black and yellow varnish and polished
brass, was a gem. It stood, panting quietly in the
sunshine, a wisp of black smoke curling up from the tall
stack behind the big brass headlight. The engine’s name,
The Belle, was on a proud brass plate on the gleaming
black barrel, and its number, No. 1, on a similar plate
below the headlight. There was one carriage, an open
affair with padded foam-rubber seats and a surrey roof of
daffodil-yellow fringed canvas to keep off the sun, and
then the brake van, also in black and yellow, with a resplendent
gilt-armed chair behind the conventional
wheel of the brake. It was a wonderful toy, even down to
the old-fashioned whistle which now gave a sharp admonitory
blast.</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga was in ebullient form. “Hear the train
blow, folks! All aboard!” There was an anticlimax. To
Bond’s dismay he took out his golden pistol, pointed it
at the sky, and pressed the trigger. He hesitated only momentarily
and fired again. The deep boom echoed back
from the wall of the station, and the stationmaster, resplendent
in old-fashioned uniform, looked nervous. He
pocketed the big silver turnip watch he had been holding
and stood back obsequiously, the green flag now
drooping at his side. Scaramanga checked his gun. He
looked thoughtfully at Bond and said, “All right, my
friend. Now then, you get up front with the driver.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled happily. “Thanks. I’ve always wanted to
do that since I was a child. What fun!”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You said it,” said Scaramanga. He turned to the
others. “And you, Mr. Hendriks. In the first seat behind
the coal-tender, please. Then Sam and Leroy. Then Hal
and Louie. I’ll be up back in the brake van. Good place
to watch out for game. Okay?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Everybody took their seats. The stationmaster had recovered
his nerve and went through his ploy with the
watch and the flag. The engine gave a triumphant hoot
and with a series of diminishing puffs got under way,
and they bowled off along the three-foot gauge line that
disappeared, as straight as an arrow, into a dancing shimmer
of silver.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond read the speed gauge. It said twenty. For the
first time he paid attention to the driver. He was a villainous-looking
Rastafari in dirty khaki overalls with a
sweat rag round his forehead. A cigarette drooped from
between the thin moustache and the straggling beard.
He smelled quite horrible. Bond said, “My name’s Mark
Hazard. What’s yours?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Rass, man! Ah doan talk wid buckra.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The expression “rass” is Jamaican for “shove it.”
“Buckra” is a tough colloquialism for “white man.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said equably, “I thought part of your religion
was to love thy neighbour.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The Rasta gave the whistle lanyard a long pull. When
the shriek had died away, he simply said “Sheeit,” kicked
the furnace door open, and began shovelling coal.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked surreptitiously round the cabin. Yes.
There it was! The long Jamaican cutlass, this one filed
to an inch blade with a deadly point. It was on a rack by
the man’s hand. Was this the way he was supposed to go?
Bond doubted it. Scaramanga would do the deed in a
suitably dramatic fashion and one that would give him
an alibi. Second executioner would be Hendriks. Bond
looked back over the low coal-tender. Hendriks’ eyes,
bland and indifferent, met his. Bond shouted above the
iron clang of the engine, “Great fun, what?” Hendriks’
eyes looked away and back again. Bond stooped so that
he could see under the surrey roof. All the other four
men were sitting motionless, their eyes also fixed on
Bond. Bond waved a cheerful hand. There was no response.
So they had been told! Bond was a spy in their
midst, and this was his last ride. In mobese, he was “going
to be hit.” It was an uncomfortable feeling having
those ten enemy eyes watching him like ten gun barrels.
Bond straightened himself. Now the top half of his body,
like the iron “man” in a pistol range, was above the roof
of the surrey, and he was looking straight down the flat
yellow surface to where Scaramanga sat on his solitary
throne, perhaps twenty feet away, with all his body in
full view. He also was looking down the little train at
Bond—the last mourner in the funeral cortege behind
the cadaver that was James Bond. Bond waved a cheery
hand and turned back. He opened his coat and got a moment’s
reassurance from the cool butt of his gun. He felt
in his trouser pocket. Three spare magazines. Ah well!
He’d take as many of them as he could with him. He
flipped down the codriver’s seat and sat on it. No point
in offering a target until he had to. The Rasta flicked his
cigarette over the side and lit another. The engine was
driving herself. He leant against the cabin wall and
looked at nothing.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had done his homework on the 1:50,000 Overseas
Survey map that Mary had provided, and he knew
exactly the route the little cane line took. First there
would be five miles of the cane fields, between whose
high green walls they were now travelling. Then came
Middle River, followed by the vast expanse of swamplands,
now being slowly reclaimed but still shown on the
map as <span class="calibre2">THE GREAT MORASS</span>. Then would come Orange
River leading into Orange Bay, and then more sugar
and mixed forest and agricultural smallholdings until
they came to the little hamlet of Green Island at the
head of the excellent anchorage of Green Island Harbour.</p>

<p class="pindent">A hundred yards ahead, a turkey buzzard rose from
beside the line, and after a few heavy flaps, caught the
inshore breeze and soared up and away. There came the
boom of Scaramanga’s gun. A feather drifted down from
the great right-hand wing of the big bird. The turkey
buzzard swerved and soared higher. A second shot rang
out. The bird gave a jerk and began to tumble untidily
down out of the sky. It jerked again as a third bullet hit
it before it crashed into the cane. There was applause
from under the yellow roof. Bond leant out and called to
Scaramanga, “That’ll cost you five pounds unless you’ve
squared the Rasta. That’s the fine for killing a John
Crow.”</p>

<p class="pindent">A shot whistled past Bond’s head. Scaramanga laughed.
“Sorry. Thought I saw a rat.” And then, “Come on, Mr.
Hazard. Let’s see some gun play from you. There’s some
cattle grazing by the line up there. See if you can hit a
cow at ten paces.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The hoods guffawed. Bond put his head out again.
Scaramanga’s gun was on his lap. Out of the corner of his
eye he saw that Mr. Hendriks, perhaps ten feet behind
him, had his right hand in his coat pocket. Bond called,
“I never shoot game that I don’t eat. If you’ll eat the
whole cow, I’ll shoot it for you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The gun flashed and boomed as Bond jerked his head
under cover of the coal-tender. Scaramanga laughed
harshly. “Watch your lip, limey, or you’ll end up without
it.” The hoods hawhawed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Beside Bond, the Rasta gave a curse. He pulled hard
on the whistle lanyard. Bond looked down the line. Far
ahead, across the rails, something pink showed. Without
releasing the whistle, the driver pulled on a lever.
Steam belched from the train’s exhaust, and the engine
began to slow. Two shots rang out, and the bullets
clanged against the iron roof over his head. Scaramanga
shouted angrily, “Keep steam up, damn you to hell!”</p>

<p class="pindent">The Rasta quickly pushed up the lever, and the speed
of the train gathered back to twenty miles an hour. He
shrugged. He glanced at Bond. He licked his lips wetly.
“Dere’s white trash across de line. Guess mebbe it’s some
frien’ of de boss.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond strained his eyes. Yes! It was a naked pink body
with golden blonde hair! A girl’s body!</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga’s voice boomed against the wind. “Folks.
Just a little surprise for you all. Something from the
good old Western movies. There’s a girl on the line
ahead. Tied across it. Take a look. And you know what?
It’s the girl friend of a certain man we’ve been hearing
of called James Bond. Would you believe it? And her
name’s Goodnight, Mary Goodnight. It sure is good
night for her. If only that fellow Bond was aboard now, I
guess we’d be hearing him holler for mercy.”</p>
