<p class="line9">The Chief of Staff stood in front of M.’s desk and said
firmly, “I really wouldn’t do it, sir. I can see him, or
someone else can. I don’t like the smell of it at all. I
think 007’s round the bend. There’s no doubt it’s him
all right. The prints have just been confirmed by Chief
of Security. And the pictures are all right—and the recording
of his voice. But there are too many things that
don’t add up. This forged passport we found in his room
at the Ritz, for instance. All right. So he wanted to come
back into the country quietly. But it’s too good a job.
Typical K.G.B. sample. And the last entry is West Germany,
day before yesterday. Why didn’t he report to Station
B or W? Both those Heads of Station are friends of
his, particularly 016 in Berlin. And why didn’t he go
and have a look at his flat? He’s got some sort of a housekeeper
there, Scotswoman called May, who’s always
sworn he was still alive and has kept the place going on
her savings. The Ritz is sort of stage Bond. And these
new clothes. Why did he have to bother? Doesn’t matter
what he was wearing when he came in through Dover.
Normal thing, if he was in rags, would have been to give
me a ring—he had my home number—and get me to fix
him up. Have a few drinks and run over his story and
then report here. Instead of that we’ve got this typical
penetration approach and Security worried as hell.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The Chief of Staff paused. He knew he wasn’t getting
through. As soon as he had begun, M. had swivelled his
chair sideways and had remained, occasionally sucking at
an unlighted pipe, gazing moodily out through the window
at the jagged skyline of London. Obstinately, the
Chief of Staff concluded, “Do you think you could leave
this one to me, sir? I can get hold of Sir James Molony in
no time and have 007 put into The Park for observation
and treatment. It’ll all be done very gently. V.I.P.
handling and so on. I can say you’ve been called to the
Cabinet or something. Security says 007’s looking a bit
thin. Build him up. Convalescence and all that. That
can be the excuse. If he cuts up rough, we can always
give him some dope. He’s a good friend of mine. He
won’t hold it against us. He obviously needs to be got
back in the groove—if we can do it, that is.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M. slowly swivelled his chair round. He looked up at
the tired, worried face that showed the strain of being
the equivalent of Number Two in the Secret Service for
ten years and more. M. smiled. “Thank you, Chief of
Staff. But I’m afraid it’s not as easy as all that. I sent 007
out on his last job to shake him out of his domestic worries.
You remember how it all came about. Well, we had
no idea that what seemed a fairly peaceful mission was
going to end up in a pitched battle with Blofeld. Or that
007 was going to vanish off the face of the earth for a
year. Now we’ve got to know what happened during that
year. And 007’s quite right. I sent him out on that mission,
and he’s got every right to report back to me personally.
I know 007. He’s a stubborn fellow. If he says he
won’t tell anyone else, he won’t. Of course I want to hear
what happened to him. You’ll listen in. Have a couple of
good men at hand. If he turns rough, come and get him.
As for his gun”—M. gestured vaguely at the ceiling—“I
can look after that. Have you tested the damned thing?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, sir. It works all right. But. . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">M. held up a hand. “Sorry, Chief of Staff. It’s an order.”
A light winked on the intercom. “That’ll be him.
Send him straight in, would you?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Very good, sir.” The Chief of Staff went out and
closed the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond was standing smiling vaguely down at
Miss Moneypenny. She looked distraught. When James
Bond shifted his gaze and said “Hullo, Bill” he still wore
the same distant smile. He didn’t hold out his hand. Bill
Tanner said, with a heartiness that rang with a terrible
falsity in his ears, “Hullo, James. Long time no see.” At
the same time, out of the corner of his eye, he saw Miss
Moneypenny give a quick, emphatic shake of the head.
He looked her straight in the eyes. “M. would like to see
007 straight away.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Miss Moneypenny lied desperately: “You know M.’s
got a Chiefs of Staff meeting at the Cabinet Office in five
minutes?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes. He says you must somehow get him out of it.”
The Chief of Staff turned to James Bond. “Okay, James.
Go ahead. Sorry you can’t manage lunch. Come and
have a gossip after M.’s finished with you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “That’ll be fine.” He squared his shoulders
and walked through the door over which the red light
was already burning.</p>

<p class="pindent">Miss Moneypenny buried her face in her hands. “Oh,
Bill!” she said desperately. “There’s something wrong
with him. I’m frightened.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bill Tanner said, “Take it easy, Penny. I’m going to
do what I can.” He walked quickly into his office and
shut the door. He went over to his desk and pressed a
switch. M.’s voice came into the room: “Hullo, James.
Wonderful to have you back. Take a seat and tell me all
about it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bill Tanner picked up the office telephone and asked
for Head of Security.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond took his usual place across the desk from
M. A storm of memories whirled through his consciousness
like badly cut film on a projector that had gone
crazy. Bond closed his mind to the storm. He must concentrate
on what he had to say, and do, and on nothing
else.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m afraid there’s a lot I still can’t remember, sir. I
got a bang on the head”—he touched his right temple—“somewhere
along the line on that job you sent me to do
in Japan. Then there’s a blank until I got picked up by
the police on the waterfront at Vladivostok. No idea how
I got there. They roughed me up a bit and in the process
I must have got another bang on the head because suddenly
I remembered who I was and that I wasn’t a Japanese
fisherman which was what I thought I was. So then
of course the police passed me on to the local branch of
the K.G.B.—it’s a big grey building on the Morskaya
Ulitsa facing the harbour near the railway station, by the
way—and when they belinographed my prints to Moscow
there was a lot of excitement and they flew me there
from the military airfield just north of the town at
Vtoraya Rechka and spent weeks interrogating me—or
trying to, rather, because I couldn’t remember anything
except when they prompted me with something they
knew themselves and then I could give them a few hazy
details to add to their knowledge. Very frustrating for
them.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Very,” commented M. A small frown had gathered
between his eyes. “And you told them everything you
could? Wasn’t that rather generous of you?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“They were very nice to me in every way, sir. It
seemed the least I could do. There was this Institute
place in Leningrad. They gave me V.I.P. treatment.
Top brain specialists and everything. They didn’t seem
to hold it against me that I’d been working against them
for most of my life. And other people came and talked to
me very reasonably about the political situation and so
forth. The need for East and West to work together for
world peace. They made clear a lot of things that hadn’t
occurred to me before. They quite convinced me.” Bond
looked obstinately across the table into the clear blue
sailor’s eyes that now held a red spark of anger. “I don’t
suppose you understand what I mean, sir. You’ve been
making war against someone or other all your life.
You’re doing so at this moment. And for most of my
adult life you’ve used me as a tool. Fortunately that’s all
over now.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M. said fiercely, “It certainly is. I suppose among
other things you’ve forgotten is reading reports of our
P.O.W.s in the Korean war who were brainwashed by
the Chinese. If the Russians are so keen on peace, what
do they need the K.G.B. for? At the last estimate, that was
about one hundred thousand men and women ‘making
war’—as you call it—against us and other countries. This
is the organization that was so charming to you in Leningrad.
Did they happen to mention the murder of
Horcher and Stutz in Munich last month?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh yes, sir.” Bond’s voice was patient, equable.
“They have to defend themselves against the secret services
of the West. If you would demobilize all this”—Bond
waved a hand—“they would be only too delighted
to scrap the K.G.B. They were quite open about it all.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“And the same thing applies to their two hundred divisions
and their U-boat fleet and their I.C.B.M.s, I suppose?”
M.’s voice rasped.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course, sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, if you found these people so reasonable and
charming, why didn’t you stay there? Others have. Burgess
is dead, but you could have chummed up with Maclean.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“We thought it more important that I should come
back and fight for peace here, sir. You and your agents
have taught me certain skills for use in the underground
war. It was explained to me how these skills could be
used in the cause of peace.”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond’s hand moved nonchalantly to his right-hand
coat pocket. M., with equal casualness, shifted his
chair back from his desk. His left hand felt for the button
under the arm of the chair.</p>

<p class="pindent">“For instance?” said M. quietly, knowing that death
had walked into the room and was standing beside him,
and that this was an invitation for death to take his place
in the chair.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond had become tense. There was a whiteness
round his lips. The blue-grey eyes still stared blankly,
almost unseeingly at M. The words rang out harshly, as
if forced out of him by some inner compulsion. “It
would be a start if the warmongers could be eliminated,
sir. This is for Number One on the list.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The hand, snub-nosed with black metal, flashed out of
the pocket, but, even as the poison hissed down the barrel
of the bulb-butted pistol, the great sheet of armour-plate
glass hurtled down from the baffled slit in the ceiling
and, with a last sigh of hydraulics, braked to the
floor. The jet of viscous brown fluid splashed harmlessly
into its centre and trickled slowly down, distorting the
reflection of M.’s face and the arm he had automatically
thrown up for additional protection.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Chief of Staff had burst into the room, followed
by the Head of Security. They threw themselves on
James Bond. Even as they seized his arms, his head fell
forward on his chest and he would have slid from his
chair to the ground if they hadn’t supported him. They
hauled him to his feet. He was in a dead faint. The Head
of Security sniffed. “Cyanide,” he said curtly. “We must
all get out of here. And bloody quick!” (The emergency
had snuffed out Headquarters manners.) The pistol lay
on the carpet where it had fallen. He kicked it away. He
said to M., who had walked out from behind his glass
shield, “Would you mind leaving the room, sir? Quickly.
I’ll have this cleaned up during the lunch hour.” It was
an order. M. went to the open door. Miss Moneypenny
stood with her clenched hand up to her mouth. She
watched with horror as James Bond’s supine body was
hauled out and, the heels of its shoes leaving tracks on
the carpet, taken into the Chief of Staff’s room.</p>

<p class="pindent">M. said sharply, “Close that door, Miss Moneypenny.
Get the duty M.O. up right away. Come along, girl!
Don’t just stand there gawking! And not a word of this
to anyone. Understood?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Miss Moneypenny pulled herself back from the edge
of hysterics. She said an automatic “Yes, sir,” pulled the
door shut, and reached for the interoffice telephone.</p>

<p class="pindent">M. walked across and into the Chief of Staff’s office
and closed the door. Head of Security was on his knees
beside Bond. He had loosened his tie and collar button
and was feeling his pulse. Bond’s face was white and
bathed in sweat. His breathing was a desperate rattle, as
if he had just run a race. M. looked briefly down at him
and then, his face hidden from the others, at the wall
beyond the body. He turned to the Chief of Staff. He
said briskly, “Well, that’s that. My predecessor died in
that chair. Then it was a simple bullet, but from much
the same sort of a crazed officer. One can’t legislate
against the lunatic. But the Office of Works certainly did
a good job with that gadget. Now then, Chief of Staff.
This is of course to go no further. Get Sir James Molony
as soon as you can and have 007 taken down to The
Park. Ambulance, surreptitious guard. I’ll explain
things to Sir James this afternoon. Briefly, as you heard,
the K.G.B. got hold of him. Brainwashed him. He was
already a sick man. Amnesia of some kind. I’ll tell you
all I know later. Have his things collected from the Ritz
and his bill paid. And put something out to the Press
Association. Something on these lines: ‘The Ministry of
Defence is pleased—’ no, say ‘delighted to announce that
Commander James Bond etc., who was posted as missing,
believed killed while on a mission to Japan last November,
has returned to this country after a hazardous
journey across the Soviet Union which is expected to
yield much valuable information. Commander Bond’s
health has inevitably suffered from his experiences and
he is convalescing under medical supervision.’ ” M.
smiled frostily. “That bit about information’ll give no
joy to Comrade Semichastny and his troops. And add a D
notice-to-editors: ‘It is particularly requested, for security
reasons, that the minimum of speculation or comment
be added to the above communiqué and that no
attempts be made to trace Commander Bond’s whereabouts.’
All right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bill Tanner had been writing furiously to keep up
with M. He looked up from his scratchpad, bewildered.
“But aren’t you going to make any charges, sir? After all,
treason and attempted murder . . . I mean, not even a
court martial?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Certainly not.” M.’s voice was gruff. “007 was a sick
man. Not responsible for his actions. If one can brainwash
a man, presumably one can un-brainwash him. If
anyone can, Sir James can. Put him back on half pay for
the time being, in his old Section. And see he gets full
back pay and allowances for the past year. If the K.G.B.
has the nerve to throw one of my best men at me, I have
the nerve to throw him back at them. 007 was a good
agent once. There’s no reason why he shouldn’t be a
good agent again. Within limits, that is. After lunch,
give me the file on Scaramanga. If we can get him fit
again, that’s the right-sized target for 007.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The Chief of Staff protested, “But that’s suicide, sir!
Even 007 could never take him.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M. said coldly, “What would 007 get for this morning’s
bit of work? Twenty years? As a minimum, I’d say.
Better for him to fall on the battlefield. If he brings it
off, he’ll have won his spurs back again and we can all
forget the past. Anyway, that’s my decision.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a knock on the door and the duty Medical
Officer came into the room. M. bade him good afternoon
and turned stiffly on his heel and walked out through the
open door.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Chief of Staff looked at the retreating back. He
said, under his breath, “You coldhearted bastard!”
Then, with his usual minute thoroughness and sense of
duty, he set about the tasks he had been given. His not to
reason why!</p>
