<p class="line9">The extremely smart policeman from the wrecking
squad on the railway came down the riverbank at the
normal, dignified gait of a Jamaican constable on his
beat. No Jamaican policeman ever breaks into a run. He
has been taught that this lacks authority. Felix Leiter,
now put under with morphine by the doctor, had said
that a good man was after a bad man in the swamp and
that there might be shooting. Felix Leiter wasn’t more
explicit than that, but when he said he was from the
F.B.I.—a legitimate euphemism—in Washington, the policeman
tried to get some of the wrecking squad to come
with him and when he failed, sauntered cautiously off on
his own, his baton swinging with assumed jauntiness.</p>

<p class="pindent">The boom of the guns and the explosion of screeching
marsh birds gave him an approximate fix. He had been
born not far away, at Negril, and as a boy he had often
used his gins and his slingshot in these marshes. They
held no fears for him. When he came to the approximate
point on the riverbank, he turned left into the mangrove,
and conscious that his black-and-blue uniform
was desperately conspicuous, stalked cautiously from
clump to clump into the morass. He was protected by
nothing but his nightstick and the knowledge that to kill
a policeman was a capital offence without the option. He
only hoped that the good man and the bad man knew
this too.</p>

<p class="pindent">With all the birds gone, there was dead silence. The
constable noticed that the tracks of bush rats and other
small animals were running past him on a course that
converged with his target area. Then he heard the rattling
scuttle of the crabs, and in a moment, from behind
a thick mangrove clump, he saw the glint of Scaramanga’s
shirt. He watched and listened. There was no
movement and no sound. He strolled, with dignity, into
the middle of the clearing, looked at the two bodies and
the guns, and took out his nickel police whistle and
blew three long blasts. Then he sat down in the shade of
a bush, took out his report pad, licked his pencil, and
began writing in a laborious hand.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">A week later, James Bond regained consciousness. He
was in a green-shaded room. He was under water. The
slowly revolving fan in the ceiling was the screw of a ship
that was about to run him down. He swam for his life.
But it was no good. He was tied down, anchored to the
bottom of the sea. He screamed at the top of his lungs.
To the nurse at the end of the bed it was the whisper of a
moan. At once she was beside him. She put a cool hand
on his forehead. While she took his pulse, James Bond
looked up at her with unfocused eyes. So this was what a
mermaid looked like! He muttered “You’re pretty,” and
gratefully swam back down into her arms.</p>

<p class="pindent">The nurse wrote ninety-five on his sheet and telephoned
down to the ward sister. She looked in the dim
mirror and tidied her hair in preparation for the
R.M.O. in charge of this apparently Very Important Patient.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Resident Medical Officer, a young Jamaican
graduate from Edinburgh, arrived with the matron, a
kindly dragon on loan from King Edward VII’s. He
heard the nurse’s report. He went over to the bed and
gently lifted Bond’s eyelids. He slipped a thermometer
under Bond’s armpit and held Bond’s pulse in one hand
and a pocket chronometer in the other, and there was
silence in the little room. Outside, the traffic tore up and
down a Kingston road.</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor released Bond’s pulse and slipped the
chronometer back into the trouser pocket under the
white smock. He wrote figures on the chart. The nurse
held the door open, and the three people went out into
the corridor. The doctor talked to the matron. The
nurse was allowed to listen. “He’s going to be all right.
Temperature well down. Pulse a little fast, but that may
have been the result of his waking. Reduce the antibiotics.
I’ll talk to the floor sister about that later. Keep on
with the intravenous feeding. Dr. Macdonald will be up
later to attend to the dressings. He’ll be waking again. If
he asks for something to drink, give him fruit juice. He
should be on soft foods soon. Miracle really. Missed the
abdominal viscera. Didn’t even shave a kidney. Muscle
only. That bullet was clipped in enough poison to kill a
horse. Thank God that man at Sav’ La Mar recognized
the symptoms of snake venom and gave him those massive
anti-snakebite injections. Remind me to write to
him, matron. He saved the man’s life. Now then, no visitors
of course, for at least another week. You can tell the
police and the High Commissioner’s Office that he’s on
the mend. I don’t know who he is, but apparently London
keeps on worrying us about him. Something to do
with the Ministry of Defence. From now on, put them
and all other inquiries through to the High Commissioner’s
Office. They seem to think they’re in charge of
him.” He paused. “By the way, how’s his friend getting
on in Number Twelve? The one the American ambassador
and Washington have been on about. He’s not on
my list, but he keeps on asking to see this Mr. Bond.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Compound fracture of the tibia,” said the matron.
“No complications.” She smiled. “Except that he’s a bit
fresh with the nurses. He should be walking with a stick
in ten days. He’s already seen the police. I suppose it’s all
to do with that story in the <span class="it">Gleaner</span> about those American
tourists being killed when the Orange River Bridge
collapsed. But the Commissioner’s handling it all personally.
The story in the <span class="it">Gleaner</span>’s very vague.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor smiled. “Nobody tells me anything. Just as
well. I haven’t got the time to listen to them. Well,
thank you, matron. I must get along. Multiple crash at
Halfway Tree. The ambulances’ll be here any minute.”
He hurried away. The matron went about her business.
The nurse, excited by all this high-level talk, went softly
back into the green-shaded room, tidied the sheet over
the naked right shoulder of her patient where the doctor
had pulled it down, and went back to her chair at the
end of the bed and her copy of <span class="it">Ebony</span>.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">Ten days later, the little room was crowded. James
Bond, propped up among extra pillows, was amused by
the galaxy of officialdom that had been assembled. On
his left was the Commissioner of Police, resplendent in
his black uniform with silver insignia. On his right was a
justice of the Supreme Court in full regalia, accompanied
by a deferential clerk. A massive figure, to whom
Felix Leiter, on crutches, was fairly respectful, had been
introduced as “Colonel Bannister” from Washington.
Head of Station C, a quiet civil servant called Alec Hill,
who had been flown out from London, stood near the
door and kept his appraising eyes unwaveringly on
Bond. Mary Goodnight, who was to take notes of the
proceedings but also, on the matron’s strict instructions,
watch for any sign of fatigue in James Bond and have
absolute authority to close the meeting if he showed
strain, sat demurely beside the bed with a shorthand pad
on her knees. But James Bond felt no strain. He was delighted
to see all these people and know that at last he
was back in the great world again. The only matters that
worried him were that he had not been allowed to see
Felix Leiter before the meeting to agree their stories and
that he had been rather curtly advised by the High
Commissioner’s Office that legal representation would
not be necessary.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Police Commissioner cleared his throat. He said,
“Commander Bond, our meeting here today is largely a
formality, but it is held on the Prime Minister’s instructions
and with your doctor’s approval. There are many
rumours running around the island and abroad, and Sir
Alexander Bustamante is most anxious to have them dispelled
for the sake of justice and of the island’s good
name. So this meeting is in the nature of a judicial inquiry
having Prime Ministerial status. We very much
hope that, if the conclusions of the meeting are satisfactory,
there need be no more legal proceedings whatever.
You understand?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes,” said Bond—who didn’t.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Now,” the Commissioner spoke weightily. “The facts
as ascertained are as follows. Recently there took place at
the Thunderbird Hotel in the Parish of Westmoreland a
meeting of what can only be described as foreign gangsters
of outstanding notoriety, including representatives
of the Soviet secret service, the Mafia, and the Cuban
secret police. The objects of this meeting were, <span class="it">inter
alia</span>, sabotage of Jamaican installations in the cane industry,
stimulation of illicit ganja-growing in the island
and purchase of the crop for export, the bribery of a
high Jamaican official with the object of installing gangster-run
gambling in the island, and sundry other malfeasances
deleterious to law and order in Jamaica and to
her international standing. Am I correct, Commander?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes,” said Bond, this time with a clear conscience.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Now.” The Commissioner spoke with even greater
emphasis. “The intentions of this subversive group became
known to the Criminal Investigation Department
of the Jamaican police and the facts of the proposed assembly
were placed before the Prime Minister in person
by myself. Naturally the greatest secrecy was observed. A
decision then had to be reached as to how this meeting
was to be kept under surveillance and penetrated so that
its intentions might be learned. Since friendly nations,
including Britain and the United States, were involved,
secret conversations took place with the representatives
of the Ministry of Defence in Britain and of the Central
Intelligence Agency in the United States. As a result, expert
personnel in the shape of yourself, Mr. Nicholson
and Mr. Leiter were generously made available, at no
cost to the Jamaican government, to assist in unveiling
these secret machinations against Jamaica held on Jamaican
soil.” The Commissioner paused and looked
round the room to see if he had stated the position correctly.
Bond noticed that Felix Leiter nodded his head
vigorously with the others, but, in his case, in Bond’s direction.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled. He had at last got the message. He also
nodded his agreement.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Accordingly,” continued the Commissioner, “and
working throughout under the closest liaison and direction
of the Jamaican C.I.D., Messrs. Bond, Nicholson,
and Leiter carried out their duties in exemplary fashion.
The true intentions of the gangsters were unveiled, but
alas, in the process, the identity of at least one of the
Jamaica-controlled agents was discovered and a battle
royal took place. During the course of this, thanks to the
superior gunfire of Commander Bond and Mr. Leiter,
the following enemy agents—here there will be a list—were
killed. Immediately after, thanks to Mr. Leiter’s
ingenious use of explosive on the Orange River Bridge,
the following—another list—lost their lives. Unfortunately,
two of the Jamaica-controlled agents received
severe wounds from which they are now recovering in
the Memorial Hospital. It remains to mention the names
of Constable Percival Sampson of the Negril Constabulary,
who was first on the scene of the final battlefield,
and Dr. Lister Smith of Savannah La Mar, who rendered
vital first aid to Commander Bond and Mr. Leiter. On
the instructions of the Prime Minister, Sir Alexander
Bustamante, a judicial inquiry was held this day at the
bedside of Commander Bond and in the presence of
Mr. Felix Leiter to confirm the above facts. These, in
the presence of Justice Morris Cargill of the Supreme
Court, are now and hereby confirmed.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The Commissioner was obviously delighted with his
rendering of all this rigmarole. He beamed at Bond. “It
only remains”—he handed Bond a sealed packet, a similar
one to Felix Leiter, and one to Colonel Bannister—“to
confer on Commander Bond of Great Britain, Mr.
Felix Leiter of the United States, and, in absentia, Mr.
Nicholas Nicholson of the United States, the immediate
award of the Jamaican Police Medal for gallant and meritorious
services to the Independent State of Jamaica.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was muted applause. Mary Goodnight went on
clapping after the others had stopped. She suddenly realized
the fact, blushed furiously, and stopped.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond and Felix Leiter made stammered acknowledgments.
Justice Cargill rose to his feet and, in
solemn tones, asked Bond and Leiter in turn, “Is this a
true and correct account of what occurred between the
given dates?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, indeed,” said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’ll say it is, Your Honour,” said Felix Leiter fervently.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Judge bowed. All except Bond rose and bowed.
Bond just bowed. “In that case, I declare this inquiry
closed.” The bewigged figure turned to Miss Goodnight.
“If you will be kind enough to obtain all the signatures,
duly witnessed, and send them round to my chambers?
Thank you so much.” He paused and smiled. “And the
carbon, if you don’t mind?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Certainly, my lord.” Mary Goodnight glanced at
Bond. “And now, if you will forgive me, I think the patient
needs a rest. Matron was most insistent. . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">Goodbyes were said. Bond called Leiter back. Mary
Goodnight smelled private secrets. She admonished,
“Now, only a minute!” and went out and closed the
door.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter leant over the end of the bed. He wore his most
quizzical smile. He said, “Well, I’ll be goddamned,
James. That was the neatest wrapup job I’ve ever lied
my head off at. Everything clean as a whistle, and we’ve
even collected a piece of lettuce.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Talking starts with the stomach muscles. Bond’s
wounds were beginning to ache. He smiled, not showing
the pain. Leiter was due to leave that afternoon. Bond
didn’t want to say goodbye to him. Bond treasured his
men friends and Felix Leiter was a great slice of his past.
He said, “Scaramanga was quite a guy. He should have
been taken alive. Maybe Tiffy really did put the hex on
him with Mother Edna. They don’t come like that
often.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter was unsympathetic. “That’s the way you limeys
talk about Rommel and Dönitz and Guderian. Let alone
Napoleon. Once you’ve beaten them, you make heroes
out of them. Don’t make sense to me. In my book, an
enemy’s an enemy. Care to have Scaramanga back? Now,
in this room, with his famous golden gun on you—the
long one or the short one? Standing where I am? One
bets you a thousand you wouldn’t. Don’t be a jerk,
James. You did a good job. Pest control. It’s got to be
done by someone. Going back to it when you’re off the
orange juice?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Felix Leiter jeered at him. “Of course you are, lame-brain.
It’s what you were put into the world for. Pest
control, like I said. All you got to figure is how to control
it better. The pests’ll always be there. God made
dogs. He also made their fleas. Don’t let it worry your
tiny mind. Right?” Leiter had seen the sweat on James
Bond’s forehead. He limped towards the door and
opened it. He raised a hand briefly. The two men had
never shaken hands in their lives. Leiter looked into the
corridor. He said, “Okay, Miss Goodnight. Tell matron
to take him off the danger list. And tell him to keep
away from me for a week or two. Every time I see him a
piece of me gets broken off. I don’t fancy myself as The
Vanishing Man.” Again he raised his only hand in
Bond’s direction and limped out.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shouted, “Wait, you bastard!” But, by the time
Leiter had limped back into the room, Bond, no effort
left in him to fire off the volley of four-letter words that
were to be his only answer to his friend, had lapsed into
unconsciousness.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mary Goodnight shooed the remorseful Leiter out of
the room and ran off down the corridor to the floor sister.</p>
