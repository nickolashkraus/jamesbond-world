<p class="line9">Bond knelt down beside Tiffy and gave her a couple of
sharp slaps on the right cheek. Then on the left. The wet
eyes came back into focus. She put her hand up to her
face and looked at Bond with surprise. Bond got to his
feet. He took a cloth and wetted it at the tap, then leant
down and put his arm round her and wiped the cloth
gently over her face. Then he lifted her up and handed
her her bag that was on a shelf behind the counter. He
said, “Come on, Tiffy. Make up that pretty face again.
Business’ll be warming up soon. The leading lady’s got
to look her best.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiffy took the bag and opened it. She looked past
Bond and saw Scaramanga for the first time since the
shooting. The pretty lips drew back in a snarl. She whispered
fiercely so that only Bond could hear, “I’m goin’
fix that man, but good. There’s Mother Edna up Orange
Hill way. She’s an obeah top woman. I’ll go up there
tomorrow. Come a few days, he won’t know what hit
him.” She took out a mirror and began doing up her
face. Bond reached into his hip pocket and counted out
five one-pound notes. He stuffed them into her open
bag.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You forget all about it. This’ll buy you a nice canary
in a cage to keep you company. Anyway, another pair of
klings’ll come along if you put some food out.” He patted
her shoulder and moved away. When he came up
with Scaramanga he stopped and said, “That may have
been a good circus act”—he used the word again on purpose—“but
it was rough on the girl. Give her some
money.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga said “Shove it” out of the corner of his
mouth. He said suspiciously, “And what’s all this yack
about circuses?” He turned to face Bond. “Just stop
where you are, mister, and answer a few questions. Like
I said, are you from the police? You’ve sure got the smell
of cops around you. If not, what are you doing here-abouts?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “People don’t tell me what to do. I tell
them.” He walked on into the middle of the room and
sat down at a table. He said, “Come and sit down and
stop trying to lean on me. I’m unleanable-on.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga shrugged. He took two long strides,
picked up one of the metal chairs, twirled it round and
thrust it between his legs, and sat ass-backwards, his left
arm lying along the back of the chair. His right arm
rested on his thigh, inches from the pistol butt that
showed above the waistband of his trousers. Bond recognized
that it was a good working position for a gunman,
the metal back of the chair acting as a shield for most of
the body. This was certainly a most careful and professional
man.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond, both hands in full view on the tabletop, said
cheerfully, “No. I’m not from the police. My name’s
Mark Hazard. I’m from a company called Transworld
Consortium. I’ve been doing a job up at Frome, the
WISCO sugar place. Know it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sure I know it. What you been doing there?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Not so fast, my friend. First of all, who are you and
what’s your business?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Scaramanga. Francisco Scaramanga. Labour relations.
Ever heard of me?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond frowned. “Can’t say I have. Should I have?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Some people who hadn’t are dead.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“A lot of people who haven’t heard of me are dead.”
Bond leaned back. He crossed one leg over the other,
above the knee, and grasped the ankle in a clubman
pose. “I do wish you’d stop talking in heroics. For instance,
seven hundred million Chinese have certainly
heard of neither of us. You must be a frog in a very small
pool.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga did not rise to the jibe. He said reflectively,
“Yeah. I guess you could call the Caribbean a
pretty small pool. But there’s good pickin’s to be had
from it. The Man with the Golden Gun. That’s what
they call me in these parts.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It’s a handy tool for solving labour problems. We
could do with you up at Frome.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Been having trouble up there?” Scaramanga looked
bored.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Too many cane fires.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Was that your business?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sort of. One of the jobs of my company is insurance
investigation.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Security work. I’ve come across guys like you before.
Thought I could smell the cop-smell.” Scaramanga
looked satisfied that his guess had been right. “Did you
get anywhere?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Picked up a few Rastafari. I’d have liked to get rid of
the lot of them. But they went crying to their union that
they were being discriminated against because of their
religion, so we had to call a halt. So the fires’ll begin
again soon. That’s why I say we could do with a good
enforcer up there.” Bond added blandly, “I take it that’s
another name for your profession?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Again Scaramanga dodged the sneer. He said, “You
carry a gun?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course. You don’t go after the Rastas without
one.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What kind of a gun?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Walther PPK. Seven sixty-five millimetre.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, that’s a stopper all right.” Scaramanga turned
towards the counter. “Hey, cool cat. Couple of Red
Stripes, if you’re in business again.” He turned back and
the blank eyes looked hard at Bond. “What’s your next
job?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’t know. I’ll have to contact London and find out
if they’ve got any other problems in the area. But I’m in
no hurry. I work for them more or less on a free-lance
basis. Why? Any suggestions?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The other man sat quiet while Tiffy came out from
behind the counter. She came over to the table and
placed the tin tray with the bottles and glasses in front of
Bond. She didn’t look at Scaramanga. Scaramanga uttered
a harsh bark of laughter. He reached inside his
coat and took out an alligator-skin billfold. He extracted
a hundred-dollar bill and threw it on the table. “No
hard feelings, cool cat. You’d be okay if you didn’t always
keep your legs together. Go buy yourself some
more birds with that. I like to have smiling people
around me.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiffy picked up the bill. She said, “Thanks, mister.
You’d be surprised what I’m going to spend your money
on.” She gave him a long, hard look and turned on her
heel.</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga shrugged. He reached for a bottle of beer
and a glass, and both men poured and drank. Scaramanga
took out an expensive cigar case, selected a pencil-thin
cheroot and lit it with a match. He let the smoke
dribble out between his lips and inhaled the thin stream
up his nostrils. He did this several times with the same
mouthful of smoke until the smoke was dissipated. All
the while he stared across the table at Bond, seeming to
weigh up something in his mind. He said, “Care to earn
yourself a grand—a thousand bucks?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “Possibly.” He paused and added, “Probably.”
What he meant was, “Of course! If it means staying
close to you, my friend.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga smoked awhile in silence. A car stopped
outside and two laughing men came quickly up the
steps. When they came through the bead curtains, working-class
Jamaicans, they stopped laughing and went
quietly over to the counter and began whispering to
Tiffy. Then they both slapped a pound note on the
counter and, making a wide detour away from the white
men, disappeared through the curtains at the back of the
room. Their laughter began again as Bond heard their
footsteps on the stairs.</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga hadn’t taken his eyes from Bond’s face.
Now he said, keeping his voice low, “I got myself a problem.
Some partners of mine, they’ve taken an interest in
this Negril development. Far end of the property. Place
called Bloody Bay. Know it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’ve seen it on the map. Just short of Green Island
Harbour.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Right. So I’ve got some shares in the business. So we
start building the Thunderbird Hotel and get the first
storey finished and the main living rooms and restaurant
and so on. So then the tourist boom slackens off—Americans
get frightened of being so close to Cuba or some
such crap. And the banks get difficult and money begins
to run short. Follow me?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“So you’re a stale bull of the place?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Right. So I’m opening the hotel for a few days because
I got a half-dozen of the main stockholders to fly in
for a meeting on the spot. Sort of look the place over and
get our heads together and figure what to do next. Now,
I want to give these guys a good time, so I’m getting a
smart combo over from Kingston, calypso singers, limbo
dancers, plenty of girls—all the jazz. And there’s swimming,
and one of the features of the place is a small-scale
railway that used to handle the sugar cane. Runs to
Green Island Harbour, where I’ve got a forty-foot Chris-Craft
Roamer. Deep-sea fishing. That’ll be another outing.
Get me? Give the guys a real good time.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“So that they’ll get all enthusiastic and buy out your
share of the stock?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga frowned angrily. “I’m not paying you a
grand to get the wrong ideas. Or any ideas for that matter.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What for then?”</p>

<p class="pindent">For a moment or two Scaramanga went through his
smoking routine, the little pillars of smoke vanishing
again and again into the black nostrils. It seemed to calm
him. His forehead cleared. He said, “Some of these men
are kind of rough. We’re all stockholders, of course, but
that don’t necessarily mean we’re friends. Understand?
I’ll be wanting to hold some meetings, private meetings,
with maybe only two or three guys at a time, sort of
sounding out the different interests. Could be that some
of the other guys, the ones not invited to a particular
meeting, might get it into their heads to bug a meeting
or try and get wise to what goes on in one way or another.
So it just occurs to me that you being live to security
and such, that you could act as a kind of guard at
these meetings, clean the room for mikes, stay outside
the door and see that no one comes nosing around, see
that when I want to be private I git private. D’you get
the picture?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had to laugh. He said, “So you want to hire me
as a kind of personal bodyguard. Is that it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The frown was back. “And what’s so funny about that,
mister? It’s good money, ain’t it? Three maybe four days
in a luxury joint like the Thunderbird. A thousand
bucks at the end of it? What’s so screwy about that proposition,
eh?” Scaramanga mashed out the butt of his cigar
against the underside of the table. A shower of sparks
fell. He let them lie.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond scratched the back of his head as if reflecting.
Which he was—furiously. He knew that he hadn’t heard
the full story. He also knew that it was odd, to say the
least of it, for this man to hire a complete stranger to do
this job for him. The job itself stood up, but only just. It
made sense that Scaramanga would not want to hire a
local man, an ex-policeman for instance, even if one
could be found. Such a man might have friends in the
hotel business who would be interested in the speculative
side of the Negril development. And, of course, on
the plus side, Bond would be achieving what he had
never thought possible—he would have got right inside
Scaramanga’s guard. Or would he? There was the strong
smell of a trap. But, assuming that Bond had not, by
some obscure bit of ill luck, been blown, he couldn’t for
the life of him see what the trap could be. Well, clearly,
he must make the gamble. In so many respects it was a
chance in a million.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond lit a cigarette. He said, “I was only laughing at
the idea of a man of your particular skills wanting protection.
But it all sounds great fun. Of course I’ll come
along. When do we start? I’ve got a car at the bottom of
the road.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga thrust out an inside wrist and looked at a
thin gold watch on a two-coloured gold bracelet. He
said, “Six thirty-two. My car’ll be outside.” He got up.
“Let’s go. But don’t forget one thing, mister whoosis. I
rile mighty easy. Get me?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said easily, “I saw how annoyed you got with
those inoffensive birds.” He stood up. “I don’t see any
reason why either of us should get riled.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga said indifferently, “Okay, then.” He
walked to the back of the room and picked up his suitcase,
new-looking but cheap, strode to the exit, and
clashed through the bead curtains and down the steps.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond went quickly over to the counter. “Goodbye,
Tiffy. Hope I’ll be coming by again one day. If anyone
should ask after me, say I’m at the Thunderbird Hotel at
Bloody Bay.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiffy reached out a hand and timidly touched his
sleeve. “Go careful over there, Mister Mark. There’s
gangster money in that place. And watch out for yourself.”
She jerked her head towards the exit: “That’s the
worstest man I ever heard tell of.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Then she leaned forward and whispered, “That’s a
thousand pounds’ worth of ganja he’s got in the bag. A
Rasta left it for him this morning. So I smelled the bag.”
She drew quickly back.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “Thanks, Tiffy. See Mother Edna puts a
good hex on him. I’ll tell you why someday. I hope.
’Bye!” He went quickly out and down into the street,
where a red Thunderbird convertible was waiting, its
exhaust making a noise like an expensive motorboat.
The chauffeur was a Jamaican, smartly dressed, with a
peaked cap. A red pennant on the wireless aerial said
<span class="calibre2">THUNDERBIRD HOTEL</span> in gold. Scaramanga was sitting beside
the chauffeur. He said impatiently, “Get in the back
and we’ll give you a lift down to your car. Then follow
along. It gets a good road after a while.”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond got into the car behind Scaramanga and
wondered whether to shoot the man now, in the back of
the head—the old Gestapo-K.G.B. point of puncture. A
mixture of reasons prevented him—the itch of curiosity,
an inbuilt dislike of cold murder, the feeling that this
was not the predestined moment, the likelihood that he
would have to murder the chauffeur also—these, combined
with the softness of the night and the fact that the
sound system was now playing a good recording of one of
his favourites, “After You’ve Gone,” and that cicadas
were singing from the <span class="it">lignum vitae</span> tree, said no. But at
that moment, as the car coasted down Love Lane towards
the bright mercury of the sea, James Bond knew
that he was not only disobeying orders, or at best dodging
them, but also being a bloody fool.</p>
