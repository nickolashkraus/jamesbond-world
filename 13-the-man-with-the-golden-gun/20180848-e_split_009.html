<p class="line9">There are few less prepossessing places to spend a hot
afternoon than Kingston International Airport in Jamaica.
All the money has been spent on lengthening the
runway out into the harbour to take the big jets, and
little was left over for the comfort of transit passengers.
James Bond had come in an hour before on a B.W.I.A.
flight from Trinidad, and there were two hours to go
before he could continue the roundabout journey to
Havana. He had taken off his coat and tie and now sat on
a hard bench gloomily surveying the contents of the In-Bond
shop with its expensive scents, liquor, and piles of
overdecorated native ware. He had had luncheon on the
plane, it was the wrong time for a drink, and it was too
hot and too far to take a taxi into Kingston even had he
wanted to. He wiped his already soaking handkerchief
over his face and neck and cursed softly and fluently.</p>

<p class="pindent">A cleaner ambled in and, with the exquisite languor
of such people throughout the Caribbean, proceeded to
sweep very small bits of rubbish hither and thither, occasionally
dipping a boneless hand into a bucket to
sprinkle water over the dusty cement floor. Through the
slatted jalousies a small breeze, reeking of the mangrove
swamps, briefly stirred the dead air and then was gone.
There were only two other passengers in the “lounge,”
Cubans perhaps, with jippa-jappa luggage. A man and a
woman. They sat close together against the opposite wall
and stared fixedly at James Bond, adding minutely to
the oppression of the atmosphere. Bond got up and went
over to the shop. He bought a <span class="it">Daily Gleaner</span> and returned
to his place. Because of its inconsequence and occasionally
bizarre choice of news the <span class="it">Gleaner</span> was a favourite
paper of Bond’s. Almost the whole of that day’s
front page was taken up with new ganja laws to prevent
the consumption, sale, and cultivation of this local version
of marijuana. The fact that de Gaulle had just sensationally
announced his recognition of Red China was
boxed well down the page. Bond read the whole paper—“Country
Newsbits” and all—with the minute care bred
of desperation.</p>

<p class="pindent">His horoscope said: “<span class="calibre2">CHEER UP</span>! Today will bring a
pleasant surprise and the fulfilment of a dear wish. But
you must earn your good fortune by watching closely for
the golden opportunity when it presents itself and then
seizing it with both hands.” Bond smiled grimly. He
would be unlikely to get on the scent of Scaramanga on
his first evening in Havana. It was not even certain that
Scaramanga was there. This was a last resort. For six
weeks, Bond had been chasing his man round the Caribbean
and Central America. He had missed him by a day
in Trinidad and by only a matter of hours in Caracas.
Now he had rather reluctantly taken the decision to try
and ferret him out on his home ground, a particularly
inimical home ground, with which Bond was barely familiar.
At least he had fortified himself in British Guiana
with a diplomatic passport, and he was now “Courier”
Bond with splendidly engraved instructions from
Her Majesty to pick up the Jamaican diplomatic bag in
Havana and return with it. He had even borrowed the
famous Silver Greyhound, the British Courier’s emblem
for three hundred years. If he could do his job and then
get a few hundred yards’ start, this would at least give
him sanctuary in the British Embassy. Then it would be
up to the F.O. to bargain him out. If he could find his
man. If he could carry out his instructions. If he could
get away from the scene of the shooting. If, if, if. . . .
Bond turned to the advertisements on the back page.
At once an item caught his eye. It was so typically “old”
Jamaica. This is what he read:</p>

<div class="literal-container1"><div class="literal"> <!-- rend=';' -->
<p class="line11"><span class="gesp">FOR SALE BY AUCTION</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="line9">Containing the substantial residence and all that

</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class="pindent">James Bond was delighted. He had had many assignments
in Jamaica and many adventures on the island.
The splendid address and all the stuff about chains and
perches and the old-fashioned abracadabra at the end of
the advertisement brought back all the authentic smell
of one of the oldest and most romantic of former British
possessions. For all her new-found “independence” he
would bet his bottom dollar that the statue of Queen
Victoria in the centre of Kingston had <span class="it">not</span> been destroyed
or removed to a museum, as similar relics of an
historic infancy had been in the resurgent African states.
He looked at his watch. The <span class="it">Gleaner</span> had consumed a
whole hour for him. He picked up his coat and briefcase.
Not much longer to go! In the last analysis, life wasn’t
all that dismal. One must forget the bad and remember
the good. What were a couple of hours of heat and boredom
in this island compared with memories of Beau Desert
and Honeychile Rider and his survival against the
mad Dr. No? James Bond smiled to himself as the dusty
pictures clicked across his brain. How long ago it all was!
What had happened to her? She never wrote. The last he
had heard, she had had two children by the Philadelphia
doctor she had married. He wandered off into the
grandly named “Concourse,” where the booths of many
airlines stood empty and promotion folders and little
company flags on their counters gathered the dust blown
in with the mangrove breeze.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was the customary central display stand holding
messages for incoming and outgoing passengers. As
usual, Bond wondered whether there would be something
for him. In all his life there never had been. Automatically
he ran his eye over the scattered envelopes,
held, under tape, beneath each parent letter. Nothing
under “B.” And nothing under his alias “H” for “Hazard,
Mark” of the “Transworld Consortium,” successor
to the old “Universal Export,” that had recently been
discarded as cover for the Secret Service. Nothing. He
ran a bored eye over the other envelopes. He suddenly
froze. He looked around him, languidly, casually. The
Cuban couple was out of sight. Nobody else was looking.
He reached out a quick hand, wrapped in his handkerchief,
and pocketed the buff envelope that said, “Scaramanga.
BOAC passenger from Lima.” He stayed where
he was for a few minutes and then wandered slowly off to
the door marked <span class="calibre2">MEN</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">He locked the door and sat down. The envelope was
not sealed. It contained a B.W.I.A. message form. The
neat B.W.I.A. writing said:</p>

<div class="blockquoter">

<p class="pindent1">MESSAGE RECEIVED FROM KINGSTON AT 12:15:
“THE SAMPLES WILL BE AVAILABLE AT NO. 3½ S.L.M.
AS FROM MIDDAY TOMORROW.”</p>

</div>

<p class="pindent">There was no signature. Bond uttered a short bark of
laughter and triumph. S.L.M.—Savannah La Mar. Could
it be? It must be! At last the three red stars of a jackpot
had clicked into line. What was it his <span class="it">Gleaner</span> horoscope
had said? Well, he would go nap on this clue from outer
space—“seize it with both hands” as the <span class="it">Gleaner</span> had instructed.
He read the message again and carefully put it
back in the envelope. His damp handkerchief had left
marks on the buff envelope. In this heat they would dry
out in a matter of minutes. He went out and sauntered
over to the stand. There was no one in sight. He slipped
the message back into its place under “S” and walked
over to the Aeronaves de Mexico booth and cancelled his
reservation. He then went to the BOAC counter and
looked through the timetable. Yes, the Lima flight for
Kingston, New York, and London was due in at 13:15
the next day. He was going to need help. He remembered
the name of Head of Station J. He went over to
the telephone booth and got through to the High Commissioner’s
Office. He asked for Commander Ross. After
a moment a girl’s voice came on the line. “Commander
Ross’s assistant. Can I help you?”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was something vaguely familiar in the lilt of
the voice. Bond said, “Could I speak to Commander
Ross? This is a friend from London.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl’s voice became suddenly alert. “I’m afraid
Commander Ross is away from Jamaica. Is there anything
I can do?” There was a pause. “What name did
you say?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I didn’t say any name. But in fact it’s. . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">The voice broke in excitedly. “Don’t tell me. It’s
James!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. “Well I’m damned! It’s Goodnight!
What the hell are you doing here?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“More or less what I used to do for you. I heard you
were back, but I thought you were ill or something.
How absolutely marvellous! But where are you talking
from?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Kingston Airport. Now listen, darling. I need help.
We can talk later. Can you get cracking?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course. Wait till I get a pencil. Right.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“First I need a car. Anything that’ll go. Then I want
the name of the top man at Frome, you know, the
WISCO estate beyond Savannah La Mar. Large-scale
survey map of that area, a hundred pounds in Jamaican
money. Then be an angel and ring up Alexander’s the
auctioneers and find out anything you can about a property
that’s advertised in today’s <span class="it">Gleaner</span>. Say you’re a
prospective buyer. Three-and-a-half Love Lane. You’ll
see the details. Then I want you to come out to Morgan’s
Harbour, where I’m going in a minute, be staying the
night there, and we’ll have dinner and swop secrets until
the dawn steals over the Blue Mountains. Can do?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course. But that’s a hell of a lot of secrets. What
shall I wear?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Something that’s tight in the right places. Not too
many buttons.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She laughed. “You’ve established your identity. Now
I’ll get on with all this. See you about seven. ’Bye.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Gasping for air, James Bond pushed his way out of the
little sweatbox. He ran his handkerchief over his face
and neck. He’d be damned! Mary Goodnight, his darling
secretary from the old days in the Double-O Section!
At Headquarters they had said she was abroad. He
hadn’t asked any questions. Perhaps she had opted for a
change when he had gone missing. Anyway, what a
break! Now he’d got an ally, someone he knew. Good
old <span class="it">Gleaner</span>! He got his bag from the Aeronaves de Mexico
booth and went out and hailed a taxi and said “Morgan’s
Harbour” and sat back and let the air from the
open windows begin to dry him.</p>

<p class="pindent">The romantic little hotel is on the site of Port Royal
at the tip of the Palisadoes. The proprietor, an Englishman
who had once been in Intelligence himself and who
guessed what Bond’s job was, was glad to see him. He
showed Bond to a comfortable air-conditioned room
with a view of the pool and the wide mirror of Kingston
Harbour. He said, “What is it this time? Cubans or
smuggling? They’re the popular targets these days.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Just on my way through. Got any lobsters?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Be a good chap and save two for dinner. Broiled with
melted butter. And a pot of that ridiculously expensive
foie gras of yours. All right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Wilco. Celebration? Champagne on the ice?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Good idea. Now I must get a shower and some sleep.
That Kingston Airport’s murder.”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond awoke at six. At first he didn’t know
where he was. He lay and remembered. Sir James
Molony had said that his memory would be sluggish for
a while. The E.C.T. treatment at The Park, a discreet so-called
“convalescent home” in a vast mansion in Kent,
had been fierce. Twenty-four bashes at his brain from
the black box in thirty days. After it was over, Sir James
had confessed that, if he had been practising in America,
he wouldn’t have been allowed to administer more than
eighteen. At first, Bond had been terrified at the sight of
the box and of the two cathodes that would be cupped to
each temple. He had heard that people undergoing
shock treatment had to be strapped down, that their
jerking, twitching bodies, impelled by the volts, often
hurtled off the operating table. But that, it seemed, was
old hat. Now there was the longed-for needle with the
pentathol, and Sir James said there was no movement of
the body when the current flashed through except a
slight twitching of the eyelids. And the results had been
miraculous. After the pleasant, quiet-spoken analyst had
explained to him what had been done to him in Russia,
and after he had passed through the mental agony of
knowing what he had nearly done to M., the old fierce
hatred of the K.G.B. and all its works had been reborn
in him, and, six weeks after he had entered The Park, all
he wanted was to get back at the people who had invaded
his brain for their own murderous purposes. And
then had come his physical rehabilitation and the inexplicable
amount of gun practice he had had to do at the
Maidstone police range. And then the day arrived when
the Chief of Staff had come down and spent the day
briefing Bond on his new assignment. The reason for the
gun practice became clear. And the scribble of green ink
wishing him luck—signed “M.”—boosted his spirits.
Two days later he was ready to enjoy the excitement of
the ride to London Airport on his way across the world.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took another shower and dressed in shirt, slacks,
and sandals and wandered over to the little bar on the
waterfront and ordered a double Walker’s deluxe bourbon
on the rocks and watched the pelicans diving for
their dinner. Then he had another drink with a water
chaser to break it down and wondered about 3½ Love
Lane and what the “samples” would consist of and
how he would take Scaramanga. This had been worrying
him since he had been given his orders. It was all
very fine to be told to “eliminate” the man, but James
Bond had never liked killing in cold blood and to provoke
a draw against a man who was possibly the fastest
gun in the world was suicide. Well, he would just
have to see which way the cards fell. The first thing to do
was to clean up his cover. The diplomatic passport he
would leave with Goodnight. He would now be “Mark
Hazard” of the “Transworld Consortium,” the splendidly
vague title which could cover almost any kind of
human activity. His business would have to be with the
West Indian Sugar Company because that was the only
business, apart from Kaiser Bauxite, that existed in the
comparatively deserted western districts of Jamaica.
And, at Negril, there was also the project for developing
one of the most spectacular beaches in the world, beginning
with the building of the Thunderbird Hotel. He
could be a rich man looking around for a building site.
If his hunch and the childish predictions of his horoscope
were right, and he came up with Scaramanga at
the romantic Love Lane address, it would be a question
of playing it by ear.</p>

<p class="pindent">The prairie fire of the sunset raged briefly in the west
and the molten sea cooled off into moonlit gunmetal.</p>

<p class="pindent">A naked arm smelling of Chanel Number 5 snaked
round his neck and warm lips kissed the corner of his
mouth. As he reached up to hold the arm where it was, a
breathless voice said, “Oh, James! I’m sorry. I just had
to! It’s so wonderful to have you back.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond put his hand under the soft chin and lifted up
her mouth and kissed her full on the half-open lips. He
said, “Why didn’t we ever think of doing that before,
Goodnight? Three years with only that door between us!
What must we have been thinking of?”</p>

<p class="pindent">She stood away from him. The golden bell of hair fell
back to embrace her neck. She hadn’t changed. Still only
the faintest trace of makeup, but now the face was
golden with sunburn from which the wide-apart blue
eyes, now ablaze with the moon, shone out with that
challenging directness that had disconcerted him when
they had argued over some office problem. Still the same
glint of health over the good bones and the broad uninhibited
smile from the full lips that, in repose, were so
exciting. But now the clothes were different. Instead of
the severe shirt and skirt of the days at Headquarters, she
was wearing a single string of pearls and a one-piece
short-skirted frock in the colour of a pink gin with a lot
of bitters in it—the orangey-pink of the inside of a
conch shell. It was all tight against the bosom and the
hips. She smiled at his scrutiny. “The buttons are down
the back. This is standard uniform for a tropical Station.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I can just see Q Branch dreaming it up. I suppose
one of the pearls has a death pill in it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course. But I can’t remember which. I’ll just have
to swallow the whole string. Can I have a daiquiri please
instead?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gave the order. “Sorry, Goodnight. My manners
are slipping. I was dazzled. It’s so tremendous finding
you here. And I’ve never seen you in your working
clothes before. Now then, tell me the news. Where’s
Ross? How long have you been here? Have you managed
to cope with all that junk I gave you?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Her drink came. She sipped it carefully. Bond remembered
that she rarely drank and didn’t smoke. He ordered
another for himself and felt vaguely guilty that
this was his third double and that she wouldn’t know it
and when it came wouldn’t recognize it as a double. He
lit a cigarette. Nowadays he was trying to keep to twenty
and failing by about five. He stabbed the cigarette out.
He was getting near to his target, and the rigid training
rules that had been drilled into him at The Park must
from now on be observed meticulously. The champagne
wouldn’t count. He was amused by the conscience this
girl had awakened in him. He was also surprised and impressed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mary Goodnight knew that the last question was the
one he would want answered first. She reached into a
plain straw handbag on a gold metal chain and handed
him a thick envelope. She said, “Mostly in used singles.
A few fivers. Shall I debit you direct or put it in as expenses?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Direct please.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“The top man at Frome is Tony Hugill. Nice man.
Nice wife. Nice children. We’ve had a lot to do with
him, so he’ll be friendly. He was in Naval Intelligence
during the war, sort of commando job, so he knows the
score. Does a good job—Frome produces about a quarter
of Jamaica’s sugar output—but Hurricane Flora and the
tremendous rains we’ve been having here have delayed
the crop. Besides that, he’s having a lot of trouble with
cane burning and other small sabotage—mostly with
thermite bombs brought in from Cuba. Jamaica’s sugar
is competition for Castro, you see. And with Flora and
all the rains, the Cuban crop is going to be only about
three million tons this year, compared with a Batista
level of about seven—and very late because the rains
have played havoc with the sucrose content.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She smiled her wide smile. “No secrets. Just reading
the <span class="it">Gleaner</span>. I don’t understand it all, but apparently,
because of the damaged crops and increased world consumption,
there’s a tremendous chess game going on all
over the world in sugar—in what they call sugar futures,
that’s sort of buying the stuff forward for delivery dates
later in the year. Washington’s trying to keep the price
down, to upset Cuba’s economy, and Castro’s out to keep
the world price up so that he can bargain with Russia. So
it’s worth Castro’s trouble to do as much damage as possible
to rival sugar crops. He’s only got his sugar to sell
and he wants food badly. This wheat the Americans are
selling to Russia. A lot of that will find its way back to
Cuba, in exchange for sugar, to feed the Cuban sugar
croppers.” She smiled again.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Pretty daft business, isn’t it? I don’t think Castro can
hold out much longer. The missile business in Cuba
must have cost Russia about a billion pounds. And now
they’re having to pour money into Cuba, money and
goods, to keep the place on its feet. I can’t help thinking
they’ll pull out soon and leave Castro to go the way Batista
went. It’s a fiercely Catholic country, and Hurricane
Flora was considered as the final judgment from
heaven. It sat over the island and simply whipped it, day
after day, for five days. No hurricane in history has ever
behaved like that. The churchgoers don’t miss an omen
like that. It was a straight indictment of the regime.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said with admiration, “Goodnight, you’re a
treasure. You’ve certainly been doing your homework.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The direct blue eyes looked straight into his, dodging
the compliment. “This is the stuff I live with here. It’s
built into the Station. But I thought you might like
some background to Frome, and what I’ve said explains
why WISCO are getting these cane fires. At least we
think it is.” She took a sip of her drink. “Well, that’s all
about sugar. The car’s outside. You remember Strangways?
Well, it’s his old Sunbeam Alpine. The Station
bought it, and now I use it. It’s a bit aged, but it’s still
pretty fast and it won’t let you down. It’s rather bashed
about, so it won’t be conspicuous. The tank’s full, and
I’ve put the survey map in the glove compartment.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s fine. Now, last question and then we’ll go and
have dinner and tell each other our life stories. But, by
the way, what’s happened to your chief, Ross?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Mary Goodnight looked worried. “To tell you the
truth, I don’t exactly know. He went off last week on
some job to Trinidad. It was to try and locate a man
called Scaramanga. He’s a local gunman of some sort. I
don’t know much about him. Apparently Headquarters
wants him traced for some reason.” She smiled ruefully.
“Nobody ever tells me anything that’s interesting. I just
do the donkey work. Well, Commander Ross was due
back two days ago and he hasn’t turned up. I’ve had to
send off a Red Warning, but I’ve been told to give him
another week.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, I’m glad he’s out of the way. I’d rather have his
Number Two. Last question. What about this three-and-a-half
Love Lane? Did you get anywhere?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Mary Goodnight blushed. “Did I not! That was a fine
question to get me mixed up with. Alexander’s was non-committal,
and I finally had to go to the Special Branch.
I shan’t be able to show my face there for weeks. Heaven
knows what they must think of you. That place is a, is a,
er”—she wrinkled her nose—“it’s a famous disorderly
house in Sav’ La Mar.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed out loud at her discomfiture. He teased
her with malicious but gentle sadism. “You mean it’s a
whorehouse?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“James! For heaven’s sake! Must you be so crude?”</p>
