<p class="line9">The cough sounded about twenty yards away, towards
the river. Bond dropped to one knee, his senses questing
like the antennae of an insect. He waited five minutes.
When the cough was not repeated, he crept forwards on
hands and knees, his gun gripped between his teeth.</p>

<p class="pindent">In a small clearing of dried, cracked black mud, he
saw the man. He stopped in his tracks, trying to calm his
breathing.</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga was lying stretched out, his back supported
by a clump of sprawling mangrove roots. His hat
and his high stock had gone, and the whole of the right-hand
side of his suit was black with blood upon which
insects crawled and feasted. But the eyes in the controlled
face were still very much alive. They swept the
clearing at regular intervals, questing. Scaramanga’s
hands rested on the roots beside him. There was no sign
of a gun.</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga’s face suddenly pointed, like a retriever’s,
and the roving scrutiny held steady. Bond could not see
what had caught his attention, but then a patch of the
dappled shadow at the edge of the clearing moved and a
large snake, beautifully diamonded in dark and pale
brown, zigzagged purposefully across the black mud towards
the man.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond watched, fascinated. He guessed it was a boa of
the Epicrates family, attracted by the smell of blood. It
was perhaps five feet long and quite harmless to man.
Bond wondered if Scaramanga would know this. He was
immediately put out of his doubt. Scaramanga’s expression
had not changed, but his right hand crept softly
down his trouser leg, gently pulled up the cuff, and removed
a thin, stiletto-style knife from the side of his
short Texan boot. Then he waited, the knife held ready
across his stomach, not clenched in his fist, but pointed
in the flick-knife fashion. The snake paused for a moment
a few yards from the man and raised its head high
to give him a final inspection. The forked tongue licked
out inquisitively, again and again, then, still with its
head held above the ground, it moved slowly forward.</p>

<p class="pindent">Not a muscle moved in Scaramanga’s face. Only the
eyes were dead-steady, watchful slits. The snake came
into the shadow of his trouser leg and moved slowly up
towards the glistening shirt. Suddenly the tongue of steel
that lay across Scaramanga’s stomach came to life and
leaped. It transfixed the head of the snake exactly in the
centre of the brain and pierced through it, pinning it to
the ground and holding it there while the powerful
body thrashed wildly, seeking a grip on the mangrove
roots, on Scaramanga’s arm. But immediately, when it
had a grip, its convulsions released its coils which flailed
off in another direction.</p>

<p class="pindent">The death struggles diminished and finally ceased altogether.
The snake lay motionless. Scaramanga was
careful. He ran his hand down the full length of the
snake. Only the tip of the tail lashed briefly. Scaramanga
extracted the knife from the head of the snake, cut off its
head with a single hard stroke, and threw it, after reflection,
accurately towards a crab hole. He waited, watching,
to see if a crab would come out and take it. None
did. The thud of the arrival of the snake’s head would
have kept any crab underground for many minutes,
however enticing the scent of what had made the thud.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond, kneeling in the bush, watched all this,
every nuance of it, with the most careful attention. Each
one of Scaramanga’s actions, every fleeting expression on
his face, had been an index of the man’s awareness of his
aliveness. The whole episode of the snake was as revealing
as a temperature chart or a lie detector. In Bond’s
judgment, Scaramanga, for all his blood-letting and internal
injuries, was still very much alive. He was still a
most formidable and dangerous man.</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga, his task satisfactorily completed, minutely
shifted his position, and, once again, made his
penetrating examination of the surrounding bush.</p>

<p class="pindent">As Scaramanga’s gaze swept by him without a flicker,
Bond blessed the darkness of his suit—a black patch of
shadow among so many others. In the sharp blacks and
whites from the midday sun, Bond was well camouflaged.</p>

<p class="pindent">Satisfied, Scaramanga picked up the limp body of the
snake, laid it across his stomach, and carefully slit it
down its underside as far as the anal vent. Then he
scoured it and carefully etched the skin away from the
red-veined flesh with the precise flicks and cuts of a surgeon.
Every scrap of unwanted reptile he threw towards
crab holes, and, with each throw, a flicker of annoyance
crossed the granite face that no one would come and
pick up the crumbs from the rich man’s table. When the
meal was ready, he once again scanned the bush, and
then, very carefully, coughed and spat into his hand. He
examined the results and flung his hand sideways. On
the black ground, the sputum made a bright pink scrawl.
The cough didn’t seem to hurt him or cause him much
effort. Bond guessed that his bullet had hit Scaramanga
in the right chest and had missed a lung by a fraction.
There was haemorrhage and Scaramanga was a hospital
case, but the blood-soaked shirt was not telling the whole
truth.</p>

<p class="pindent">Satisfied with his inspection of his surroundings, Scaramanga
bit into the body of the snake and was at once,
like a dog with its meal, absorbed by his hunger and
thirst for the blood and juices of the snake.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had the impression that if he now came forward
from his hiding place Scaramanga, like a dog,
would bare his teeth in a furious snarl. He got quietly
up from his knees, took out his gun, and, his eyes watching
Scaramanga’s hands, strolled out into the centre of
the little clearing.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was mistaken. Scaramanga did not snarl. He
barely looked up from the cut-off length of snake in his
two hands and, his mouth full of meat, said, “You’ve
been a long while coming. Care to share my meal?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No thanks. I prefer my snake grilled with hot butter
sauce. Just keep on eating. I like to see both hands occupied.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga sneered. He gestured at his blood-stained
shirt. “Frightened of a dying man? You limeys come
pretty soft.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“The dying man handled that snake quite efficiently.
Got any more weapons on you?” Scaramanga moved to
undo his coat. “Steady! No quick movements. Just show
your belt, armpits, pat the thighs inside and out. I’d do
it myself only I don’t want what the snake got. And
while you’re about it, just toss the knife into the trees.
Toss. No throwing, if you don’t mind. My trigger finger’s
been getting a bit edgy today. Seems to want to go
about its business on its own. Wouldn’t like it to take
over. Yet, that is.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga, with a flick of his wrist, tossed the knife
into the air. The sliver of steel spun like a wheel in the
sunshine. Bond had to step aside. The knife pierced the
mud where Bond had been standing and stood upright.
Scaramanga gave a harsh laugh. The laugh turned into a
cough. The gaunt face contorted painfully. Too painfully?
Scaramanga spat red, but not all that red. There
could be only slight haemorrhage. Perhaps a broken rib
or two. Scaramanga could be out of hospital in a couple
of weeks. Scaramanga put down his piece of snake and
did exactly as Bond had told him, all the while watching
Bond’s face with his usual cold, arrogant stare. He finished
and picked up the piece of snake and began gnawing
it. He looked up. “Satisfied?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sufficiently.” Bond squatted down on his heels. He
held his gun loosely, aiming somewhere halfway between
the two of them. “Now then, let’s talk. Afraid you
haven’t got too much time, Scaramanga. This is the end
of the road. You’ve killed too many of my friends. I have
the licence to kill you and I am going to kill you. But I’ll
make it quick. Not like Margesson. Remember him?
You put a shot through both of his knees and both of his
elbows. Then you made him crawl and kiss your boots.
You were foolish enough to boast about it to your
friends in Cuba. It got back to us. As a matter of interest,
how many men have you killed in your life?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“With you, it’ll make the round fifty.” Scaramanga
had gnawed the last segment of backbone clean. He
tossed it towards Bond. “Eat that, scum, and get on with
your business. You won’t get any secrets out of me, if
that’s the pitch. And don’t forget. I’ve been shot at by
experts and I’m still alive. Maybe not precisely kicking,
but I’ve never heard of a limey who’d shoot a defenceless
man who’s badly wounded. They haven’t got the guts.
We’ll just sit here, chewing the fat, until the rescue team
comes. Then I’ll be glad to go for trial. What’ll they get
me for, eh?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, just for a start, there’s that nice Mr. Rotkopf
with one of your famous silver bullets in his head in the
river back of the hotel.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’ll match with the nice Mr. Hendriks with one
of your bullets somewhere behind his face. Maybe we’ll
serve a bit of time together. That’d be nice, wouldn’t it?
They say the jail at Spanish Town has all the comforts.
How about it, limey? That’s where you’ll be found with
a shiv in your back in the sack-sewing department. And
by the same token, how d’you know about Rotkopf?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Your bug was bugged. Seems you’re a bit accident-prone
these days, Scaramanga. You hired the wrong security
men. Both your managers were from the C.I.A.
The tape’ll be on the way to Washington by now. That’s
got the murder of Ross on it too. See what I mean?
You’ve got it coming from every which way.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Tape isn’t evidence in an American court. But I see
what you mean, shamus. Mistakes seem to have got made.
So okay”—Scaramanga made an expansive gesture of the
right hand—“take a million bucks and call it quits?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I was offered three million on the train.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’ll double that.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No. Sorry.” Bond got to his feet. The left hand behind
his back was clenched with the horror of what he
was about to do. He forced himself to think of what the
broken body of Margesson must have looked like, of the
others that this man had killed, of the ones he would kill
afresh if Bond weakened. This man was probably the
most efficient one-man death-dealer in the world. James
Bond had him. He had been instructed to take him. He
must take him—lying down wounded or in any other position.
Bond assumed casualness, tried to make himself
the enemy’s cold equal. “Any messages for anyone, Scaramanga?
Any instructions? Anyone you want looking
after? I’ll take care of it if it’s personal. I’ll keep it to
myself.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga laughed his harsh laugh, but carefully.
This time the laugh didn’t turn into the red cough.
“Quite the little English gentleman! Just like I spelled it
out. S’pose you wouldn’t like to hand me your gun and
leave me to myself for five minutes like in the books?
Well, you’re right, boyo! I’d crawl after you and blast
the back of your head off.” The eyes still bored into
Bond’s with the arrogant superiority, the cold superman
quality that had made him the greatest pro gunman in
the world—no drinks, no drugs—the impersonal trigger
man who killed for money and, by the way he sometimes
did it, for the kicks.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond examined him carefully. How could Scaramanga
fail to break when he was going to die in minutes?
Was there some last trick the man was going to
spring? Some hidden weapon? But the man just lay
there, apparently relaxed, propped up against the mangrove
roots, his chest heaving rhythmically, the granite
of his face not crumbling even minutely in defeat. On
his forehead there was not as much sweat as there was on
Bond’s. Scaramanga lay in dappled black shadow. For
ten minutes James Bond had stood in the middle of the
clearing in blazing sunshine. Suddenly he felt the vitality
oozing out through his feet into the black mud. And
his resolve was going with it. He said, and he heard his
voice ring out harshly, “All right, Scaramanga, this is it.”
He lifted his gun and held it in the two-handed grip of
the target man. “I’m going to make it as quick as I can.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga held up a hand. For the first time his face
showed emotion. “Okay, fellow.” The voice, amazingly,
supplicated. “I’m a Catholic, see? Just let me say my last
prayer. Okay? Won’t take long, then you can blaze away.
Every man’s got to die sometime. You’re a fine guy as
guys go. It’s the luck of the game. If my bullet had been
an inch, maybe two inches, to the right, it’d be you that’s
dead in place of me. Right? Can I say my prayer, mister?”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond lowered his gun. He would give the man
a few minutes. He knew he couldn’t give him more.
Pain and heat and exhaustion and thirst. It wouldn’t be
long before he lay down himself, right there on the hard
cracked mud, just to rest. If someone wanted to kill him,
they could. He said, and the words came out slowly,
tiredly, “Go ahead, Scaramanga. One minute only.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thanks, pal.” Scaramanga’s hands went up to his
face and covered his eyes. There came a drone of Latin
which went on and on. Bond stood there in the sunshine,
his gun lowered, watching Scaramanga, but at the
same time not watching him, the edge of his focus dulled
by the pain and the heat and the hypnotic litany that
came from behind the shuttered face and the horror of
what Bond was going to have to do—in one minute, perhaps
two.</p>

<p class="pindent">The fingers of Scaramanga’s right hand crawled imperceptibly
sideways across his face, inch by inch, centimetre
by centimetre. They got to his ear and stopped.
The drone of the Latin prayer never altered its slow,
lulling tempo.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then the hand leaped behind the head and the
tiny golden Derringer roared, and James Bond spun
round as if he had taken a right to the jaw and crashed to
the ground.</p>

<p class="pindent">At once Scaramanga was on his feet and moving forward
like a swift cat. He snatched up the discarded knife
and held it forward like a tongue of silver flame.</p>

<p class="pindent">But James Bond twisted like a dying animal on the
ground and the iron in his hand cracked viciously again
and again—five times—and then fell out of his hand
onto the black earth as his gun hand went to the right
side of his belly and stayed there, clutching at the terrible
pain.</p>

<p class="pindent">The big man stood for a moment and looked up at the
deep blue sky. His fingers opened in a spasm and let go
the knife. His pierced heart stuttered and limped and
stopped. He crashed flat back and lay, his arms flung
wide, as if someone had thrown him away.</p>

<p class="pindent">After a while, the land crabs came out of their holes
and began nosing at the scraps of the snake. The bigger
offal could wait until the night.</p>
