<p class="line9">Scaramanga walked to the door and turned the lights on.
He was naked save for his shorts and the holster below
his left arm. The golden gun remained trained on Bond
as he moved.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked at him incredulously, then to the carpet
inside the door. The wedges were still there, undisturbed.
He could not possibly have got through the window
unaided. Then he saw that his clothes cupboard
stood open and that light showed through into the next
room. It was the simplest of secret doors—just the whole
of the back of the cupboard, impossible to detect from
Bond’s side of the wall and, on the other, probably, in
appearance, a locked communicating door.</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga came back into the centre of the room
and stood looking at them both. His mouth and eyes
sneered. He said, “I didn’t see this piece of tail in the
lineup. Where you been keeping it, buster? And why
d’you have to hide it away in the bathroom? Like doing
it under the shower?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “We’re engaged to be married. She works
in the British High Commissioner’s Office in Kingston.
Cypher clerk. She found out where I was staying from
that place you and I met. She came out to tell me that
my mother’s in the hospital in London. Had a bad fall.
Her name’s Mary Goodnight. What’s wrong with that?
And what do you mean coming busting into my room in
the middle of the night waving a gun about? And kindly
keep your foul tongue to yourself.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was pleased with his bluster and decided to take
the next step towards Mary Goodnight’s freedom. He
dropped his hands to his sides and turned to the girl.
“Put your hands down, Mary. Mr. Scaramanga must
have thought there were burglars about when he heard
that window bang. Now, I’ll get some clothes on and
take you out to your car. You’ve got a long drive back to
Kingston. Are you sure you wouldn’t rather stay here for
the rest of the night? I’m sure Mr. Scaramanga could
find us a spare room.” He turned back to Scaramanga.
“It’s all right, Mr. Scaramanga, I’ll pay for it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Mary Goodnight chipped in. She had dropped her
hands. She picked up her small bag from the bed where
she had thrown it, opened it and began busying herself
with her hair in a fussy, feminine way. She chattered,
falling in well with Bond’s bland piece of very British
“Now-look-here-my-man-manship.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No, honestly, darling, I really think I’d better go. I’d
be in terrible trouble if I was late at the office, and the
Prime Minister, Sir Alexander Bustamante, you know
will have his eightieth birthday, well he’s coming to
lunch, and you know His Excellency always likes me to
do the flowers and arrange the place cards and as a matter
of fact”—she turned charmingly towards Mr. Scaramanga—“it’s
quite a day for me. The party was going to
make up thirteen, so His Excellency has asked me to be
the fourteenth. Isn’t that marvellous? But heaven knows
what I’m going to look like after tonight. The roads
really are terrible in parts, aren’t they, Mr.—er—Scramble.
But there it is. And I do apologize for causing
all this disturbance and keeping you from your beauty
sleep.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She went towards him like the Queen Mother opening
a bazaar, her hand outstretched. “Now you run
along off back to bed again, and my fiancé” (Thank God
she hadn’t said James! The girl was inspired!) “will see
me safely off the premises. Goodbye, Mr., er. . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond was proud of her. It was almost pure
Joyce Grenfell. But Scaramanga wasn’t going to be
taken in by any doubletalk, limey or otherwise. She almost
had Bond covered from Scaramanga. He moved
swiftly aside. He said, “Hold it, lady. And you, mister,
stand where you are.” Mary Goodnight let her hand
drop to her side. She looked inquiringly at Scaramanga
as if he had just rejected the cucumber sandwiches.
Really! These Americans! The Golden Gun didn’t go
for polite conversation. It held dead steady between the
two of them. Scaramanga said to Bond, “Okay, I’ll buy
it. Put her through the window again. Then I’ve got
something to say to you.” He waved his gun at the girl.
“Okay, bimbo. Get going. And don’t come trespassing
on other people’s lands again. Right? And you can tell
His friggin’ Excellency where to shove his place cards.
His writ don’t run over the Thunderbird. Mine does.
Got the picture? Okay. Don’t bust your stays getting
through the window.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Mary Goodnight said icily, “Very good, Mr. . . .
er . . . I will deliver your message. I’m sure the High
Commissioner will take more careful note than he has
done of your presence on the island. And the Jamaican
government also.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond reached out and took her arm. She was on the
edge of overplaying her role. He said, “Come on, Mary.
And please tell Mother that I’ll be through here in a day
or two, and I’ll be telephoning her from Kingston.” He
led her to the window and helped, or rather bundled,
her out. She gave a brief wave and ran off across the
lawn. Bond came away from the window with considerable
relief. He hadn’t expected the ghastly mess to sort
itself out so painlessly.</p>

<p class="pindent">He went and sat down on his bed. He sat on the pillow.
He was reassured to feel the hard shape of his gun
against his thighs. He looked across at Scaramanga. The
man had put his gun back in his shoulder holster. He
leant up against the clothes cupboard and ran his finger
reflectively along the black line of his moustache. He
said, “High Commissioner’s Office. That also houses the
local representative of your famous Secret Service. I suppose,
Mister Hazard, that your real name wouldn’t be
James Bond? You showed quite a turn of speed with the
gun tonight. I seem to have read somewhere that this
man Bond fancies himself with the hardware. I also have
information to the effect that he’s somewhere in the Caribbean
and that he’s looking for me. Funny coincidence
department, eh?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed easily. “I thought the Secret Service
packed up at the end of the war. Anyway, I’m afraid I
can’t change my identity to suit your book. All you’ve
got to do in the morning is ring up Frome and ask for
Mr. Tony Hugill, the boss up there, and check on my
story. And can you explain how this Bond chap could
possibly have tracked you down to a brothel in Sav’ La
Mar? And what does he want from you anyway?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga contemplated him silently for a while.
Then he said, “Guess he may be lookin’ for a shootin’
lesson. Be glad to oblige him. But you’ve got something
about Number three-and-a-half. That’s what I figgered
when I hired you. But coincidence doesn’t come in
that size. Mebbe I should have thought again. I said
from the first I smelled cops. That girl may be your
fiancée or she may not—but that play with the shower
bath. That’s an old hood’s trick. Probably a Secret Service
one too. Unless, that is, you were screwin’ her.” He
raised one eyebrow.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I was. Anything wrong with that? What have you
been doing with the Chinese girl? Playing mah-jongg?”
Bond got to his feet. He stitched impatience and outrage
on his face in equal quantities. “Now look here, Mr.
Scaramanga. I’ve had just about enough of this. Just stop
leaning on me. You go around waving that damned gun
of yours and acting like God Almighty and insinuating a
lot of tommyrot about the Secret Service, and you expect
me to kneel down and lick your boots. Well, my friend,
you’ve come to the wrong address. If you’re dissatisfied
with the job I’m doing, just hand over the thousand dollars
and I’ll be on my way. Who in hell d’you think you
are anyway?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga smiled his thin, cruel smile. “You may be
getting wise to that sooner than you think, shamus.” He
shrugged. “Okay, okay. But just you remember this, mister.
If it turns out you’re not who you say you are, I’ll
blow you to bits. Get me? And I’ll start with the little
bits and go on to the bigger ones. Just so it lasts a heck of
a long time. Right? Now you’d better get some shuteye.
I’ve got a meeting with Mr. Hendriks at ten in the conference
room. And I don’t want to be disturbed. After
that the whole party goes on an excursion on the railroad
I was tellin’ you about. It’ll be your job to see that
that gets properly organized. Talk to the manager first
thing. Right? Okay, then. Be seeing ya.” Scaramanga
walked into the clothes cupboard, brushed Bond’s suit
aside, and disappeared. There came a decisive click from
the next room. Bond got to his feet. He said “phew!” at
the top of his voice and walked off into the bathroom to
wash the last two hours away in the shower.</p>

<p class="pindent">He awoke at 6:30, by arrangement with that curious
extrasensory alarm clock that some people keep in their
heads that always seems to know the exact time. He put
on his bathing trunks and went out to the beach and
did his long swim again. When at 7:15 he saw Scaramanga
come out of the west wing, followed by the boy
carrying his towel, he made for the shore. He listened for
the twanging thump of the trampoline and then, keeping
well out of sight of it, entered the hotel by the main
entrance, and moved quickly down the corridor to his
room. He listened at his window to make sure the man
was still exercising, then he took the master key Nick
Nicholson had given him and slipped across the corridor
to Number 20 and was quickly inside. He left the door
on the latch. Yes, there was his target, lying on the dressing
table. He strode across the room, picked up the gun,
and slipped out the round in the cylinder that would next
come up for firing. He put the gun down exactly as he
had found it, got back to the door, listened, and then was
out and across the corridor and into his own room. He
went back to the window and listened. Yes. Scaramanga
was still at it. It was an amateurish ploy that Bond had
executed, but it might gain him just that fraction of a
second that—he felt it in his bones—was going to be life
or death for him in the next twenty-four hours. In his
mind, he smelled that slight whiff of smoke that indicated
that his cover was smouldering at the edges. At any
moment Mark Hazard of the Transworld Consortium
might go up in flames, like some clumsy effigy on Guy
Fawkes Night, and James Bond would stand there, revealed,
with nothing between him and a possible force
of six other gunmen but his own quick hand and the
Walther PPK. So every shade of odds that he could shift
to his side of the board would be worthwhile. Undismayed
by the prospect, in fact rather excited by it, he
ordered a large breakfast, consumed it with relish, and
after pulling the connecting pin out of the ballcock in
his lavatory, went along to the manager’s office.</p>

<p class="pindent">Felix Leiter was on duty. He gave a thin managerial
smile and said, “Good morning, Mr. Hazard. Can I help
you?” Leiter’s eyes were looking beyond Bond, over his
right shoulder. Mr. Hendriks materialized at the desk
before Bond could answer.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “Good morning.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr. Hendriks replied with his little Germanic bow.
He said to Leiter, “The telephone operator is saying
that there is a long-distance call from my office in Havana.
Where is the most private place to take it, pliss?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Not in your bedroom, sir?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Is not sufficiently private.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond guessed that he too had bowled out the microphone.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter looked helpful. He came out from behind his
desk. “Just over here, sir. The lobby telephone. The box
is soundproof.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr. Hendriks looked stonily at him. “And the machine.
That also is soundproof?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter looked politely puzzled. “I’m afraid I don’t understand,
sir. It is connected directly with the operator.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Is no matter. Show me, pliss.” Mr. Hendriks followed
Leiter to the far corner of the lobby and was
shown into the booth. He carefully closed the leather-padded
door and picked up the receiver and talked into
it. Then he stood waiting, watching Leiter come back
across the marble floor and speak deferentially to Bond.
“You were saying, sir?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It’s my lavatory. Something wrong with the ballcock.
Is there anywhere else?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m so sorry, sir. I’ll have the house engineer look at
it at once. Yes, certainly. There’s the lobby toilet. The
decoration isn’t completed and it’s not officially in use,
but it’s in perfectly good working order.” He lowered
his voice. “And there’s a connecting door with my office.
Leave it for ten minutes while I run back the tape of
what this bastard’s saying. I heard the call was coming
through. Don’t like the sound of it. May be your worry.”
He gave a little bow and waved Bond towards the central
table with magazines on it. “If you’ll just take a seat
for a few moments, sir, and then I’ll take care of you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond nodded his thanks and turned away. In the
booth, Hendriks was talking. His eyes were fixed on
Bond with a terrible intensity. Bond felt the skin crawl
at the base of his stomach. This was it all right! He sat
down and picked up an old <span class="it">Wall Street Journal</span>. Surreptitiously
he tore a small piece out of the centre of page
one. It could have been a tear at the crossfold. He held
the paper up at page two and watched Hendriks through
the little hole.</p>

<p class="pindent">Hendriks watched the back of the paper and talked
and listened. He suddenly put down the receiver and
came out of the booth. His face gleamed with sweat. He
took out a clean white handkerchief and ran it over his
face and neck and walked rapidly off down the corridor.</p>

<p class="pindent">Nick Nicholson, as neat as a pin, came across the lobby
and, with a courtly smile and a bow for Bond, took up
his place behind the desk. It was 8:30. Five minutes
later, Felix Leiter came out from the inner office. He
said something to Nicholson and came over to Bond.
There was a pale, pinched look round his mouth. He
said, “And now, if you’ll follow me, sir.” He led the way
across the lobby, unlocked the men’s room door, followed
Bond in, and locked the door behind him. They
stood among the carpentry work by the washbasins. Leiter
said tensely, “I guess you’ve had it, James. They were
talking Russian, but your name and number kept on
cropping up. Guess you’d better get out of here just as
quickly as that old jalopy of yours’ll carry you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled thinly. “Forewarned is forearmed, Felix.
I knew it already. Hendriks has been told to rub me.
Our old friend at K.G.B. headquarters, Semichastny, has
got it in for me. I’ll tell you why one of these days.” He
told Leiter of the Mary Goodnight episode of the early
hours. Leiter listened gloomily. Bond concluded, “So
there’s no object in getting out now. We shall hear all
the dope and probably their plans for me at this meeting
at ten. Then they’ve got this excursion business afterwards.
Personally, I guess the shooting match’ll take
place somewhere out in the country, where there are no
witnesses. Now, if you and Nick could work out something
that’d upset the Away Engagement, I’ll make myself
responsible for the home pitch.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter looked thoughtful. Some of the cloud lifted
from his face. He said, “I know the plans for this afternoon.
Off on this miniature train through the cane
fields, picnic, then the boat out of Green Island Harbour,
deep-sea fishing, and all that. I’ve reconnoitred the
route for it all.” He raised the thumb of his left hand
and pinged the end of his steel hook thoughtfully. “Ye-e-e-s.
It’s going to mean some quick action and a heap of
luck, and I’ll have to get the hell up to Frome for some
supplies from your friend Hugill. Will he hand over
some gear on your say-so? Okay, then. Come into my
office and write him a note. It’s only a half-hour’s drive
and Nick can hold the front desk for that time. Come
on.” He opened a side door and went through into his
office. He beckoned Bond to follow and shut the door
behind him. At Leiter’s dictation, Bond took down the
note to the manager of the WISCO sugar estates and
then went out and along to his room. He took a strong
nip of straight bourbon and sat on the edge of his bed
and looked unseeingly out of the window and across the
lawn to the sea’s horizon. Like a dozing hound chasing a
rabbit in its dreams, or like the audience at an athletics
meeting that lifts a leg to help the high-jumper over the
bar, every now and then, his right hand twitched involuntarily.
In his mind’s eye, in a variety of imagined circumstances,
it was leaping for his gun.</p>

<p class="pindent">Time passed and James Bond still sat there, occasionally
smoking halfway through a Royal Blend and then
absent-mindedly stubbing it out in the bed-table ashtray.
No observer could have guessed what Bond was
thinking about—or how intently he was concentrating.
There were some signs of tension—the pulse in his left
temple was beating a little fast, the lips were slightly
pursed—but the brooding, blue-grey eyes that saw nothing
were relaxed, almost sleepy. It would have been impossible
to guess that James Bond was contemplating the
possibility of his own death later that day, feeling the
soft-nosed bullets tearing into him, seeing his body jerking
on the ground, his mouth perhaps screaming. Those
were certainly part of his thoughts, but the twitching
right hand was evidence that, in much of the whirring
film of his thoughts, the enemy’s fire was not going unanswered—perhaps
had even been anticipated.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond gave a deep relaxed sigh. His eyes came
back into focus. He looked at his watch. It said 9:50. He
got up, ran both hands down his lean face with a scrubbing
motion, and went out and along the corridor to the
conference room.</p>
