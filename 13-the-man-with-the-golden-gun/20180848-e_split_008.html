<p class="line9">At Blades, M. ate his usual meagre luncheon—a grilled
Dover sole followed by the ripest spoonful he could
gouge from the club Stilton. And as usual he sat by himself
in one of the window seats and barricaded himself
behind <span class="it">The Times</span>, occasionally turning a page to demonstrate
that he was reading it, which, in fact, he wasn’t.
But Porterfield commented to the headwaitress, Lily, a
handsome, much-loved ornament of the club, that
“there’s something wrong with the old man today. Or
maybe not exactly wrong, but there’s something up with
him.” Porterfield prided himself on being something of
an amateur psychologist. As headwaiter, and father confessor
to many of the members, he knew a lot about all of
them and liked to think he knew everything, so that, in
the tradition of incomparable servants, he could anticipate
their wishes and their moods. Now, standing with
Lily in a quiet moment behind the finest cold buffet on
display at that date anywhere in the world, he explained
himself. “You know that terrible stuff Sir Miles always
drinks? That Algerian red wine that the wine committee
won’t even allow on the wine list. They only have it in
the club to please Sir Miles. Well, he explained to me
once that in the navy they used to call it the Infuriator
because if you drank too much of it, it seems that it used
to put you into a rage. Well now, in the ten years that
I’ve had the pleasure of looking after Sir Miles, he’s
never ordered more than half a carafe of the stuff.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Porterfield’s benign, almost priestly countenance assumed
an expression of theatrical solemnity as if he had
read something really terrible in the tea leaves. “Then
what happens today?” Lily clasped her hands tensely and
bent her head fractionally closer to get the full impact of
the news. “The old man says, ‘Porterfield. A bottle of
Infuriator. You understand? A full bottle!’ So of course I
didn’t say anything but went off and brought it to him.
But you mark my words, Lily”—he noticed a lifted hand
down the long room and moved off—“there’s something
hit Sir Miles hard this morning and no mistake.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M. sent for his bill. As usual he paid, whatever the
amount of the bill, with a five-pound note for the pleasure
of receiving in change crisp new pound notes, new
silver and gleaming copper pennies, for it is the custom
at Blades to give its members only freshly minted
money. Porterfield pulled back his table and M. walked
quickly to the door, acknowledging the occasional greeting
with a preoccupied nod and a brief lifting of the
hand. It was two o’clock. The old black Phantom Rolls
took him quietly and quickly northwards through
Berkeley Square, across Oxford Street and via Wigmore
Street, into Regent’s Park. M. didn’t look out at the
passing scene. He sat stiffly in the back, his bowler hat
squarely set on the middle of his head, and gazed unseeing
at the back of the chauffeur’s head with hooded,
brooding eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">For the hundredth time, since he had left his office
that morning, he assured himself that his decision was
right. If James Bond could be straightened out—and M.
was certain that that supreme neurologist, Sir James
Molony, could bring it off—it would be ridiculous to reassign
him to normal staff duties in the Double-O Section.
The past could be forgiven, but not forgotten—except
with the passage of time. It would be most irksome
for those in the know to have Bond moving about Headquarters
as if nothing had happened. It would be doubly
embarrassing for M. to have to face Bond across that
desk. And James Bond, if aimed straight at a known target—M.
put it in the language of battleships—was a supremely
effective firing-piece. Well, the target was
there and it desperately demanded destruction. Bond
had accused M. of using him as a tool. Naturally. Every
officer in the Service was a tool for one secret purpose or
another. The problem on hand could only be solved by a
killing. James Bond would not possess the Double-O
prefix if he had not high talents, frequently proved, as a
gunman. So be it! In exchange for the happenings of
that morning, in expiation of them, Bond must prove
himself at his old skills. If he succeeded, he would have
regained his previous status. If he failed, well, it would
be a death for which he would be honoured. Win or lose,
the plan would solve a vast array of problems. M. closed
his mind once and for all on his decision. He got out of
the car and went up in the lift to the eighth floor and
along the corridor, smelling the smell of some unknown
disinfectant more and more powerfully as he approached
his office.</p>

<p class="pindent">Instead of using his key to the private entrance at the
end of the corridor M. turned right, through Miss
Moneypenny’s door. She was sitting in her usual place,
typing away at the usual routine correspondence. She
got to her feet.</p>

<p class="pindent">“What’s this dreadful stink, Miss Moneypenny?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I don’t know what it’s called, sir. Head of Security
brought along a squad from Chemical Warfare at the
War Office. He says your office is all right to use again
but to keep the windows open for a while. So I’ve turned
on the heating. Chief of Staff isn’t back from lunch yet,
but he told me to tell you that everything you wanted
done is under way. Sir James is operating until four but
will expect your call after that. Here’s the file you
wanted, sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M. took the brown folder with the red Top Secret star
in its top right-hand corner. “How’s 007? Did he come
round all right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Miss Moneypenny’s face was expressionless. “I gather
so, sir. The M.O. gave him a sedative of some kind, and
he was taken off on a stretcher during the lunch hour.
He was covered up. They took him down in the service
lift to the garage. I haven’t had any inquiries.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Good. Well, bring me in the signals, would you.
There’s been a lot of time wasted today on all these domestic
excitements.” Carrying the brown folder, M.
went through the door into his office. Miss Moneypenny
brought in the signals and stood dutifully beside him
while he went through them, occasionally dictating a
comment or a query. She looked down at the bowed,
iron-grey head with the bald patch polished for years by
a succession of naval caps and wondered, as she had wondered
so often over the past ten years, whether she loved
or hated this man. One thing was certain. She respected
him more than any man she had known or had read of.</p>

<p class="pindent">M. handed her the file. “Thank you. Now just give me
a quarter of an hour, and then I’ll see whoever wants
me. The call to Sir James has priority of course.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M. opened the brown folder, reached for his pipe and
began absent-mindedly filling it as he glanced through
the list of subsidiary files to see if there was any other
docket he immediately needed. Then he set a match to
his pipe and settled back in his chair and read:</p>

<p class="line11">FRANCISCO (PACO) “PISTOLS”</p>
<p class="line11">SCARAMANGA</p>
</div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class="line9">And underneath, in lower-case type:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="line9">Free-lance assassin mainly under K.G.B. control
through D.S.S., Havana, Cuba, but often as an independent
operator for other organizations, in the
Caribbean and Central American states. Has caused
widespread damage, particularly to the S.S., but also
to C.I.A. and other friendly services, by murder and
scientific maiming since 1959, the year when Castro
came to power and which seems also to have been
the trigger for Scaramanga’s operations. Is widely
feared and admired in said territory throughout
which he appears, despite police precautions, to
have complete freedom of access. Has thus become
something of a local myth and is known in his “territory”
as The Man with the Golden Gun—a reference
to his main weapon which is a gold-plated,
long-barrelled, single-action Colt .45. He uses special
bullets with a heavy, soft (24 ct.) gold core
jacketed with silver and cross-cut at the tip, on the
dum-dum principle, for maximum wounding effect.
Himself loads and artifices this ammunition. Is responsible
for the death of 267 (British Guiana),
398 (Trinidad), 943 (Jamaica), and 768 and 742
(Havana), and for the maiming and subsequent retirement
from the S.S. of 098, Area Inspection Officer,
by bullet wounds in both knees. (See above references
in Central Records for Scaramanga’s victims
in Martinique, Haiti, and Panama.)</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="pindent"><span class="calibre2">DESCRIPTION</span>: Age about 35. Height 6 ft. 3 in.
Slim and fit. Eyes, light brown. Hair reddish in a
crew cut. Long sideburns. Gaunt, sombre face with
thin pencil moustache, brownish. Ears very flat to
the head. Ambidextrous. Hands very large and
powerful and immaculately manicured. Distinguishing
marks: a third nipple about two inches
below his left breast. (N.B. In Voodoo and allied
local cults this is considered a sign of invulnerability
and great sexual prowess.) Is an insatiable but
indiscriminate womanizer who invariably has sexual
intercourse shortly before a killing in the belief
that it improves his “eye.” (N.B. A belief shared by
many professional lawn tennis players, golfers, gun
and rifle marksmen, and others.)</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="pindent"><span class="calibre2">ORIGINS</span>: A relative of the Catalan family of circus
managers of the same name with whom he spent his
youth. Self-educated. At the age of 16 (after the incident
described below under <span class="calibre2">MOTIVATION</span>) emigrated
illegally to the United States where he lived
a life of petty crime on the fringes of the gangs until
he graduated as a full-time gunman for The Spangled
Mob in Nevada with the cover of pitboy in the
casino of the Tiara Hotel in Las Vegas where in fact
he acted as executioner of cheats and other transgressors
within and outside The Mob. In 1958 was
forced to flee the States as the result of a famous
duel against his opposite number for the Detroit
Purple Gang, a certain Ramon “The Rod” Rodriguez,
which took place by moonlight on the third
green of the Thunderbird golf course at Las Vegas.
(Scaramanga got two bullets into the heart of his
opponent before the latter had fired a shot. Distance
20 paces.) Believed to have been compensated
by The Mob with $100,000. Travelled the
whole Caribbean area investing fugitive funds for
various Las Vegas interests and later, as his reputation
for keen and successful dealing in real estate
and plantations became consolidated, for Trujillo
of the Dominican Republic and Batista of Cuba. In
1959 settled in Havana and, seeing the way the
wind blew, while remaining ostensibly a Batista
man, began working undercover for the Castro
party, and after the revolution, obtained an influential
post as foreign “enforcer” for the D.S.S. In
this capacity, on behalf, that is, of the Cuban secret
police, he undertook the assassinations mentioned
above.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="pindent"><span class="calibre2">PASSPORT</span>: Various, including Cuban diplomatic.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="pindent"><span class="calibre2">DISGUISES</span>: None. They are not necessary. The
myth surrounding this man, the equivalent, let us
say, of that surrounding the most famous film star,
and the fact that he has no police record, have hitherto
given him complete freedom of movement and
indemnity from interference in “his” territory. In
most of the islands and mainland republics which
constitute this territory, he has groups of admirers
(e.g., the Rastafari in Jamaica) and commands
powerful pressure groups who give him protection
and succour when called upon to do so. Moreover,
as the ostensible purchaser, and usually the legal
front, for the “hot money” properties mentioned
above, he has legitimate access, frequently supported
by his diplomatic status, to any part of his
territory.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="pindent"><span class="calibre2">RESOURCES</span>: Considerable but of unknown extent.
Travels on various credit cards of the Diners’
Club variety. Has a numbered account with the
Union des Banques de Crédit, Zurich, and appears
to have no difficulty in obtaining foreign currency
from the slim resources of Cuba when he needs it.</p>

</div>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="pindent"><span class="calibre2">MOTIVATION</span>: (Comment by C.C.). . . .</p>

</div>

<p class="pindent">M. refilled and relit his pipe, which had died. What
had gone before was routine information which added
nothing to his basic knowledge of the man. What followed
would be of more interest. “C.C.” covered the
identity of a former Regius Professor of History at
Oxford who lived a—to M.—pampered existence at
Headquarters in a small and—in M.’s opinion—overcomfortable
office. In between—again in M.’s opinion—overluxurious
and overlong meals at the Garrick Club,
he wandered, at his ease, into Headquarters, examined
such files as the present one, asked questions and had signals
of inquiry sent, and then delivered his judgment.
But M., for all his prejudices against the man, his haircut,
the casualness of his clothes, what he knew of his way
of life, and the apparently haphazard process of his ratiocination,
appreciated the sharpness of the mind, the
knowledge of the world, that C.C. brought to his task,
and, so often, the accuracy of his judgments. In short, M.
always enjoyed what C.C. had to say, and he now picked
up the file again with relish.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="pindent">I am interested in this man [wrote C.C.] and I
have caused inquiries to be made on a somewhat
wider front than usual, since it is not common to be
confronted with a secret agent who is at once so
much of a public figure and yet appears to be infinitely
successful in the difficult and dangerous field
of his choice—that of being, in common parlance, “a
gun for hire.” I think I may have found the origin
of this partiality for killing his fellow men in cold
blood, men against whom he has no personal animosity
but merely the reflected animosity of his employers,
in the following bizarre anecdote from his
youth. In the travelling circus of his father, Enrico
Scaramanga, the boy had several roles. He was a
most spectacular trick shot, he was a stand-in strong
man in the acrobatic troop, often taking the place
of the usual artiste as bottom man in the “human
pyramid” act, and he was the mahout, in gorgeous
turban, Indian robes, etc., who rode the leading elephant
in a troupe of three. This elephant, by the
name of Max, was a male, and it is a peculiarity of
the male elephant, which I have learned with much
interest and verified with eminent zoologists, that,
at intervals during the year, they go “on heat” sexually.
During these periods, a mucous deposit forms
behind the animal’s ears and this needs to be scraped
off since otherwise it causes the elephant intense irritation.
Max developed this symptom during a visit
of the circus to Trieste, but, through an oversight,
the condition was not noticed and given the necessary
treatment. The big top of the circus had been
erected on the outskirts of the town adjacent to the
coastal railway line and, on the night which was, in
my opinion, to determine the future way of life of
the young Scaramanga, Max went berserk, threw
the youth, and, screaming horrifically, trampled his
way through the auditorium, causing many casualties,
and charged off across the fairground and onto
the railway line, down which (a frightening spectacle
under the full moon which, as newspaper cuttings
record, was shining on that night) he galloped
at full speed. The local carabinièri were alerted
and set off in pursuit by car along the main road
that flanks the railway line. In due course they
caught up with the unfortunate monster, which, his
frenzy expired, stood peacefully facing back the way
he had come. Not realizing that the elephant, if approached
by his handler, could now be led peacefully
back to his stall, the police opened rapid fire
and bullets from their carbines and revolvers
wounded the animal superficially in many places.
Infuriated afresh, the miserable beast, now pursued
by the police car from which the hail of fire continued,
charged off again along the railway line. On
arrival at the fairground, the elephant seemed to
recognize his home, the big top, and, turning off the
railway line, lumbered back through the fleeing
spectators to the centre of the deserted arena, and
there, weakened by loss of blood, pathetically continued
with his interrupted act. Trumpeting dreadfully
in his agony, the mortally wounded Max endeavoured
again and again to raise himself and
stand upon one leg. Meanwhile the young Scaramanga,
now armed with his pistols, tried to throw a
lariat over the animal’s head while calling out the
“elephant talk” with which he usually controlled
him. Max seems to have recognized the youth and—it
must have been a truly pitiful sight—lowered his
trunk to allow the youth to be hoisted to his usual
seat behind the elephant’s head. But at this moment
the police burst into the sawdust ring, and their
captain, approaching very close, emptied his revolver
into the elephant’s right eye at a range of a
few feet, upon which Max fell dying to the ground.
Upon this, the young Scaramanga who, according to
the press, had a deep devotion for his charge, drew
one of his pistols and shot the policeman through
the heart, and fled off into the crowd of bystanders
pursued by the other policemen who could not fire
because of the throng of people. He made good his
escape, found his way south to Naples, and thence,
as noted above, stowed away to America.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now, I see in this dreadful experience a possible
reason for the transformation of Scaramanga into
the most vicious gunman of recent years. In him
was, I believe, born on that day a cold-blooded desire
to avenge himself on all humanity. That the
elephant had run amok and trampled many innocent
people, that the man truly responsible was his
handler, and that the police were only doing their
duty, would be, psychopathologically, either forgotten
or deliberately suppressed by a youth of hot-blooded
stock whose subconscious had been so
deeply lacerated. At all events, Scaramanga’s subsequent
career requires some explanation, and I trust
I am not being fanciful in putting forward my own
prognosis from the known facts.</p>

</div>

<p class="pindent">M. rubbed the bowl of his pipe thoughtfully down the
side of his nose. Well, fair enough! He turned back to
the file.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="pindent">I have comment [wrote C.C.] to make on this
man’s alleged sexual potency when seen in relation
to his profession. It is a Freudian thesis, with which
I am inclined to agree, that the pistol, whether in
the hands of an amateur or of a professional gunman,
has significance for the owner as a symbol of
virility—an extension of the male organ—and that
excessive interests in guns (e.g., gun collections and
gun clubs) is a form of fetishism. The partiality of
Scaramanga for a particularly showy variation of
weapon and his use of silver and gold bullets clearly
point, I think, to his being a slave to this fetish—and,
if I am right, I have doubts about his alleged
sexual prowess, for the lack of which his gun fetish
would be either a substitute or a compensation. I
have also noted, from a “profile” of this man in
<span class="it">Time</span> magazine, one fact which supports my thesis
that Scaramanga may be sexually abnormal. In listing
his accomplishments, <span class="it">Time</span> notes, but does not
comment upon, the fact that this man cannot
whistle. Now it may only be myth, and it is certainly
not medical science, but there is a popular
theory that a man who cannot whistle has homosexual
tendencies. (At this point, the reader may care
to experiment and, from his self-knowledge, help to
prove or disprove this item of folklore!—C.C.)</p>

</div>

<p class="pindent">M. hadn’t whistled since he was a boy. Unconsciously
his mouth pursed and a clear note was emitted. He uttered
an impatient “tchah!” and continued with his
reading.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="pindent">So I would not be surprised to learn that Scaramanga
is not the Casanova of popular fancy. Passing
to the wider implications of gunmanship, we enter
the realms of the Adlerian power urge as compensation
for the inferiority complex, and here I will
quote some well-turned phrases of a certain Mr.
Harold L. Peterson in his preface to his finely illustrated
<span class="it">The Book of the Gun</span> (published by Paul
Hamlyn). Mr. Peterson writes:</p>

<p class="pindent">“In the vast array of things man has invented to
better his condition, few have fascinated him more
than the gun. Its function is simple; as Oliver Winchester
said, with nineteenth-century complacency,
‘A gun is a machine for throwing balls.’ But its ever-increasing
efficiency in performing this task, and its
awesome ability to strike home from long range,
have given it tremendous psychological appeal.</p>

<p class="pindent">“For possession of a gun and the skill to use it
enormously augments the gunner’s personal power,
and extends the radius of his influence and effect a
thousand times beyond his arm’s length. And since
strength resides in the gun, the man who wields it
may be less than strong without being disadvantaged.
The flashing sword, the couched lance, the
bent longbow performed to the limit of the man
who held it. The gun’s power is inherent and needs
only to be released. A steady eye and an accurate
aim are enough. Wherever the muzzle points, the
bullet goes, bearing the gunner’s wish or intention
swiftly to the target. . . . Perhaps more than any
other implement, the gun has shaped the course of
nations and the destiny of men.”</p>

<p class="pindent">In the Freudian thesis, “his arm’s length” would
become the length of the masculine organ. But we
need not linger over these esoterica. The support
for my premise is well expressed in Mr. Peterson’s
sinewy prose and—though I would substitute the
printing press for the gun in his concluding paragraph—his
points are well taken. The subject, Scaramanga,
is, in my opinion, a paranoiac in subconscious
revolt against the father figure (i.e., the figure
of authority) and a sexual fetishist with possible
homosexual tendencies. He has other qualities
which are self-evident from the earlier testimony.
In conclusion, and having regard to the damage he
has already wrought upon the personnel of the S.S.,
I conclude that his career should be terminated
with the utmost dispatch—if necessary by the inhuman
means he himself employs—in the unlikely
event an agent of equal courage and dexterity can
be made available.</p>

<p class="line9">[Signed “C.C.”]</p>

<p class="pindent">Beneath, at the end of the docket, the Head of the
Caribbean and Central American Section had minuted
“I concur,” signed “C.A.” To this Chief of Staff had
added, in red ink, “Noted. C.O.S.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M. gazed into space for perhaps five minutes. Then he
reached for his pen and, in green ink, scrawled the word
