<p class="line9">James Bond, almost lightheaded with pleasure, picked
up a handful of travel literature from the front desk,
said “Hi!” to Mr. Gengerella, who didn’t reply, and followed
him into the conference room lobby. They were
the last to show. Scaramanga, beside the open door to the
conference room, looked pointedly at his watch and said
to Bond, “Okay, feller. Lock the door when we’re all settled,
and don’t let anyone in even if the hotel catches
fire.” He turned to the barman behind the buffet. “Get
lost, Joe. I’ll call for you later.” He said to the room,
“Right. We’re all set. Let’s go.” He led the way into the
conference room and the six men followed. Bond stood
by the door and noted the seating order round the table.
He closed the door and locked it and quickly also locked
the exit from the lobby. Then he picked up a champagne
glass from the buffet, pulled over a chair, and
sited the chair very close to the door of the conference
room. He placed the bowl of the champagne glass as near
as possible to a hinge of the door, and holding the glass
by the stem, put his left ear up against its base. Through
the crude amplifier, what had been the rumble of a voice
became Mr. Hendriks speaking, “. . . and so it is that I
will now report from my superiors in Europe. . . .”
The voice paused and Bond heard another noise, the
creak of a chair. Like lightning he pulled his chair back
a few feet, opened one of the travel folders on his lap,
and raised the glass to his lips. The door jerked open and
Scaramanga stood in the opening, twirling his passkey
on a chain. He examined the innocent figure on the
chair. He said, “Okay, feller. Just checking,” and kicked
the door shut.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond noisily locked it and took up his place again.
Mr. Hendriks said, “I have one most important message
for our chairman. It is from a sure source. There is a
man that is called James Bond that is looking for him in
this territory. This is a man who is from the British Secret
Service. I have no informations or descriptions of
this man, but it seems that he is highly rated by my superiors.
Mr. Scaramanga, have you heard of this man?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga snorted. “Hell, no! And should I care? I
eat one of their famous secret agents for breakfast from
time to time. Only ten days ago, I disposed of one of
them who came nosing after me. Man called Ross. His
body is now very slowly sinking to the bottom of a pitch
lake in Eastern Trinidad—place called La Brea. The oil
company, the Trinidad Lake Asphalt people, will obtain
an interesting barrel of crude one of these days. Next
question, please, Mr. Hendriks.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Next I am wishing to know what is the policy of The
Group in the matter of cane sabotage. At our meeting
six months ago in Havana, against my minority vote, it
was decided, in exchange for certain favours, to come to
the aid of Fidel Castro and assist in maintaining and indeed
increasing the world price of sugar to offset the
damage caused by Hurricane Flora. Since this time there
have been very numerous fires in the cane fields of Jamaica
and Trinidad. In this connection, it has come to
the ears of my superiors that individual members of The
Group, notably”—there was the rustle of paper—“Messrs.
Gengerella, Rotkopf, and Binion, in addition to
our chairman, have engaged in extensive purchasing of
July sugar futures for the benefit of private gain. . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">There came an angry murmur from round the table.
“Why shouldn’t we . . . ? Why shouldn’t they . . . ?”
The voice of Gengerella dominated the others. He
shouted, “Who in hell said we weren’t to make money?
Isn’t that one of the objects of The Group? I ask you
again, Mr. Hendriks, as I asked you six months ago, who
in hell is it among your so-called superiors who wants to
keep the price of raw sugar down? For my money, the
most interested party in such a gambit would be Soviet
Russia. They’re selling goods to Cuba, including, let me
say, the recently abortive shipment of missiles to fire
against my country, in exchange for raw sugar. They’re
sharp traders, the Reds. In their doubledealing way,
even from a friend and ally, they would want more sugar
for fewer goods. Yes? I suppose,” the voice sneered, “one
of your superiors, Mr. Hendriks, would not by any
chance be in the Kremlin?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The voice of Scaramanga cut through the ensuing
hubbub. “Hey you guys, cut it out!” A reluctant silence
fell. “When we formed this cooperative, it was agreed
that the first object was to cooperate with one another.
Okay, then. Mr. Hendriks. Let me put you more fully in
the picture. So far as the total finances of The Group are
concerned, we have a fine situation coming up. As an
investment group, we have good bets and bad bets.
Sugar is a good bet, and we should ride that bet even
though certain members of The Group have chosen not
to be on the horse. Get me? Now hear me through.
There are six ships controlled by The Group at this moment
riding at anchor outside New York and other U.S.
harbours. These ships are loaded with raw sugar. These
ships, Mr. Hendriks, will not dock and unload until
sugar futures, July futures, have risen another ten cents.
In Washington, the Department of Agriculture and the
sugar lobby know this. They know that we have them by
the balls. Meantimes the liquor lobby is leaning on
them—let alone Russia. The price of molasses is going
up with sugar, and the rum barons are kicking up hell
and want our ships let in before there’s a real shortage
and the price goes through the roof. But there’s another
side to it. We’re having to pay our crews and our charter
bills and so on, and squatting ships are dead ships, dead
losses. So something’s going to give. In the business, the
situation we’ve developed is called the floating crop
game—our ships lying offshore, lined up against the
Government of the United States. All right. So now four
of us stand to win or lose ten million bucks or so—us and
our backers. And we’ve got this little business of the
Thunderbird on the red side of the sheet. So what do
you think, Mr. Hendriks? Of course we burn the crops
where we can get away with it. I got a good in with the
Rastafaris—that’s a beat sect here that grows beards and
smokes ganja and mostly lives on a bit of land outside
Kingston called the Dungle, the Dunghill, and believes
it owes allegiance to the King of Ethiopia, this King Zog
or what-have-you, and that that’s their rightful home. So
I’ve got a man in there, a man who wants the ganja for
them, and I keep him supplied in exchange for plenty
fires and troubles on the cane lands. So all right, Mr.
Hendriks. You just tell your superiors that what goes up
must come down, and that applies to the price of sugar
like anything else. Okay?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr. Hendriks said, “I will pass on your saying, Mr.
Scaramanga. It will not cause pleasure. Now there is this
business of the hotel. How is she standing, if you pliss? I
think we are all wishing to know the true situation, isn’t
it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a growl of assent.</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga went off into a long dissertation which
was only of passing interest to Bond. Felix Leiter would
in any case be getting it all on the tape in a drawer of his
filing cabinet. He had reassured Bond on this score. The
neat American, Leiter had explained, filling him in with
the essentials, was in fact a certain Mr. Nick Nicholson
of the C.I.A. His particular concern was Mr. Hendriks,
who, as Bond had suspected, was a top man of the K.G.B.
The K.G.B. favours oblique control—a man in Geneva
being the Resident Director for Italy, for instance—and
Mr. Hendriks at The Hague was in fact Resident Director
for the Caribbean and in charge of the Havana centre.
Leiter was still working for Pinkerton’s, but was
also on the reserve of the C.I.A., who had drafted him
for this particular assignment because of his knowledge,
gained in the past mostly with James Bond, of Jamaica.
His job was to get a breakdown of The Group and find
out what they were up to. They were all well-known
hoods who would normally have been the concern of the
F.B.I., but Gengerella was a <span class="it">capo Mafioso</span> and this was
the first time the Mafia had been found consorting with
the K.G.B.—a most disturbing partnership which must
at all costs be quickly broken up, by physical elimination
if need be. Nick Nicholson, whose “front” name
was Stanley Jones, was an electronics expert. He had
traced the main lead to Scaramanga’s recording device
under the floor of the central switch room and had bled
off the microphone cable to his own tape recorder in the
filing cabinet. So Bond had not much to worry about.
He was listening to satisfy his own curiosity and to fill in
on anything that might transpire in the lobby or out of
range of the bug in the telephone on the conference
room table. Bond had explained his own presence. Leiter
had given a long low whistle of respectful apprehension.
Bond had agreed to keep well clear of the other two
men and to paddle his own canoe, but they had arranged
an emergency meeting place and a postal “drop” in the
uncompleted and <span class="calibre2">OUT OF ORDER</span> men’s room off the lobby.
Nicholson had given him a passkey for this place and
all other rooms, and then Bond had had to hurry off to
his meeting. James Bond was immensely reassured by
finding these unexpected reinforcements. He had
worked with Leiter on some of his most hazardous assignments.
There was no man like him when the chips
were down. Although Leiter had only a steel hook instead
of a right arm—a memento of one of those assignments—he
was one of the finest left-handed one-armed
shots in the States and the hook itself could be a devastating
weapon at close quarters.</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga was finishing his exposition. “So the net
of it is, gentlemen, that we need to find ten million
bucks. The interests I represent, which are the majority
interests, suggest that this sum should be provided by a
note issue, bearing interest at ten percent and repayable
in ten years, such an issue to have priority over all other
loans.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The voice of Mr. Rotkopf broke in angrily. “The hell
it will! Not on your life, mister. What about the seven
percent second mortgage put up by me and my friends
only a year back? What do you think I’d get if I went
back to Vegas with that kind of parley? The old heave-ho!
And at that I’m being optimistic.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Beggars can’t be choosers, Ruby. It’s that or close.
What have you other fellows got to say?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Hendriks said, “Ten percent on a first charge is good
pizzness. My friends and I will take one million dollars.
On the understanding, it is natural, that the conditions
of the issue are, how shall I say, more substantial, less
open to misunderstandings, than the second mortgage of
Mr. Rotkopf and his friends.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course. And I and my friends will also take a million.
Sam?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr. Binion said reluctantly, “Okay, okay. Count us in
for the same. But by golly this has got to be the last
touch.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Mr. Gengerella?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It sounds a good bet. I’ll take the rest.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The voices of Mr. Garfinkel and Mr. Paradise broke
in excitedly, Garfinkel in the lead. “Like hell you will!
I’m taking a million.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“And so am I,” shouted Mr. Paradise. “Cut the cake
equally. But dammit. Let’s be fair to Ruby. Ruby, you
oughta have first pick. How much do you want? You can
have it off the top.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I don’t want a damned cent of your phoney notes. As
soon as I get back, I’m going to reach for the best
damned lawyers in the States—all of them. You think
you can scrub a mortgage just by saying so, you’ve all got
another think coming.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was silence. The voice of Scaramanga was soft
and deadly. “You’re making a big mistake, Ruby. You’ve
just got yourself a nice fat tax loss to put against your
Vegas interests. And don’t forget that when we formed
this Group, we all took an oath. None of us was to operate
against the interests of the others. Is that your last
word?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It damn well is.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Would this help you change your mind? They’ve got
a slogan for it in Cuba—<span class="it">Rapido! Seguro! Economico!</span>
This is how the system operates.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The scream of terror and the explosion were simultaneous.
A chair crashed to the floor and there was a moment’s
silence. Then someone coughed nervously. Mr.
Gengerella said calmly, “I think that was the correct solution
of an embarrassing conflict of interests. Ruby’s
friends in Vegas like a quiet life. I doubt if they will
even complain. It is better to be a live owner of some
finely engraved paper than to be a dead holder of a second
mortgage. Put them in for a million, Pistol. I think
you behaved with speed and correctness. Now then, can
you clean this up?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sure, sure.” Scaramanga’s voice was relaxed, happy.
“Ruby’s left here to go back to Vegas. Never heard of
again. We don’t know nuthin’. I’ve got some hungry
crocs out back there in the river. They’ll give him free
transportation to where he’s going—and his baggage if
it’s good leather. I shall need some help tonight. What
about you, Sam? And you, Louie?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The voice of Mr. Paradise pleaded. “Count me out,
Pistol. I’m a good Catholic.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr. Hendriks said, “I will take his place. I am not a
Catholic person.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“So it be then. Well, fellers, any other business? If not,
we’ll break up the meeting and have a drink.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Hal Garfinkel said nervously, “Just a minute, Pistol.
What about that guy outside the door? That limey feller?
What’s he going to say about the fireworks and
all?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga’s chuckle was like the dry chuckle of a
gekko. “Just don’t you worry your tiny head about the
limey, Hal. He’ll be looked after when the weekend’s
over. Picked him up in a bordello in a village nearby.
Place where I go get my weed and a bit of local tail. Got
only temporary staff here to see you fellers have a good
time over the weekend. He’s the temporariest of the lot.
Those crocs have a big appetite. Ruby’ll be the main
dish, but they’ll need a dessert. Just you leave him to me.
For all I know he may be this James Bond man Mr.
Hendriks has told us about. I should worry. I don’t like
limeys. Like some good Yankee once said, ‘For every
Britisher that dies, there’s a song in my heart.’ Remember
the guy? Around the time of the Israeli war against
them. I dig that viewpoint. Stuck-up bastards. Stuffed
shirts. When the time comes, I’m going to let the stuffing
out of this one. Just you leave him to me. Or let’s just say
leave him to this.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled a thin smile. He could imagine the
golden gun being produced and twirled round the finger
and stuck back in the waistband. He got up and moved
his chair away from the door and poured champagne
into the useful glass and leant against the buffet and
studied the latest handout from the Jamaica Tourist
Board.</p>

<p class="pindent">The click of Scaramanga’s passkey sounded in the
lock. Scaramanga looked at Bond from the doorway. He
ran a finger along the small moustache. “Okay, fellow. I
guess that’s enough of the house champagne. Cut along
to the manager and tell him Mr. Ruby Rotkopf’ll be
checking out tonight. I’ll fix the details. And say a major
fuse blew during the meeting and I’m going to seal off
this room and find out why we’re having so much bad
workmanship around the place. Okay? Then drinks and
dinner and bring on the dancing girls. Got the picture?”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond said that he had. He weaved slightly as he
went to the lobby door and unlocked it. E. &amp; O.E. (errors
and omissions excepted), as the financial prospectuses
say, he thought that he had indeed now “got the
picture.” And it was an exceptionally clear print in
black and white without fuzz.</p>
