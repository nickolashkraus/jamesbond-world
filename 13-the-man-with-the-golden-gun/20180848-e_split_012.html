<p class="line9">When he arrives at a place on a dark night, particularly
in an alien land which he has never seen before—a
strange house, perhaps, or an hotel—even the most alert
man is assailed by the confused sensations of the meanest
tourist.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond more or less knew the map of Jamaica.
He knew that the sea had always been close to him on his
left and, as he followed the twin red glares of the leading
car through an impressive entrance gate of wrought iron
and up an avenue of young royal palms, he heard the
waves scrolling into a beach very close to his car. The
fields of sugar cane would, he guessed from the approach,
come close up against the new high wall that
surrounded the Thunderbird property, and there was a
slight smell of mangrove swamp coming down from below
the high hills whose silhouette he had occasionally
glimpsed under a scudding three-quarter moon on his
right. But otherwise he had no clue to exactly where he
was or what sort of a place he was now approaching and,
particularly for him, the sensation was an uncomfortable
one.</p>

<p class="pindent">The first law for a secret agent is to get his geography
right, his means of access and exit, and assure his communications
with the outside world. James Bond was
uncomfortably aware that for the past hour he had been
driving into limbo, and that his nearest contact was a
girl in a brothel thirty miles away. The situation was not
reassuring.</p>

<p class="pindent">Half a mile ahead, someone must have seen the approaching
lights of the leading car and pressed switches,
for there was a sudden blaze of brilliant yellow illumination
through the trees and a final sweep of the drive revealed
the hotel. With the theatrical lighting and the
surrounding blackness to conceal any evidence of halted
construction work, the place made a brave show. A vast
pale-pink-and-white pillared portico gave the hotel an
aristocratic frontage, and when Bond drew up behind
the other car at the entrance, he could see through the
tall Regency windows a vista of black-and-white marble
flooring beneath blazing chandeliers. A bell captain and
his Jamaican staff in red jackets and black trousers hurried
down the steps, and after showing great deference to
Scaramanga, took his suitcase and Bond’s. Then the
small cavalcade moved into the entrance hall, where
Bond wrote Mark Hazard and the Kensington address of
Transworld Consortium in the register.</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga had been talking to a man who appeared
to be the manager, a young American with a neat face
and a neat suit. He turned to Bond. “You’re in Number
twenty-four in the west wing. I’m close by in Number
twenty. Order what you want from room service. See
you about ten in the morning. The guys’ll be coming in
from Kingston around midday. Okay?” The cold eyes in
the gaunt face didn’t mind whether it was or not. Bond
said it was. He followed one of the bellboys with his suitcase
across the slippery marble floor and was led into a
long white corridor with a close-fitted carpet in royal-blue
Wilton. There was a smell of new paint and Jamaican
cedar. The numbered doors and the light fittings
were in good taste. Bond’s room was almost at the end on
the left. Number 20 was opposite. The bellhop unlocked
Number 24 and held the door for Bond. Air-conditioned
air gushed out. It was a pleasant modern double bedroom
and bath in grey and white. When he was alone,
Bond went to the air-conditioning control and turned it
to zero. Then he drew back the curtains and wound
down the two broad windows to let in real air. Outside,
the sea whispered softly on an invisible beach and the
moonlight splashed the black shadows of palms across
trim lawns. To his left, where the yellow light of the
entrance showed a corner of the gravel sweep, Bond
heard his car being started up and driven away, presumably
to a parking lot, which would, he guessed, be at the
rear so as not to spoil the impact of the façade. He
turned back into his room and inspected it minutely.
The only objects of suspicion were a large picture on the
wall above the two beds and the telephone. The picture
was a Jamaican market scene painted locally. Bond lifted
it off its nail, but the wall behind was innocent. He then
took out a pocketknife, laid the telephone carefully, so as
not to shift the receiver, upside down on a bed, and very
quietly and carefully unscrewed the bottom plate. He
smiled his satisfaction. Behind the plate was a small microphone
joined by leads to the main cable inside the
cradle. He screwed back the plate with the same care and
put the telephone quietly back on the night table. He
knew the gadget. It would be transistorized and of sufficient
power to pick up a conversation in normal tones
anywhere in the room. It crossed his mind to say very
devout prayers out loud before he went to bed. That
would be a fitting prologue for the central recording device!</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond unpacked his few belongings and called
room service. A Jamaican voice answered. Bond ordered
a bottle of Walker’s deluxe bourbon, three glasses, ice,
and, for nine o’clock, eggs Benedict. The voice said,
“Sure, sir.” Bond then took off his clothes, put his gun
and holster under a pillow, rang for the valet, and had
his suit taken away to be pressed. By the time he had
taken a hot shower followed by an ice-cold one and
pulled on a fresh pair of sea island cotton underpants,
the bourbon had arrived.</p>

<p class="pindent">The best drink in the day is just before the first one
(the Red Stripe didn’t count). James Bond put ice in
the glass and three fingers of the bourbon and swilled it
round the glass to cool it and break it down with the ice.
He pulled a chair up to the window, put a low table
beside it, took <span class="it">Profiles in Courage</span> by Jack Kennedy out
of his suitcase, happened to open it at Edmund G. Ross
(“I . . . looked down into my open grave”), then went
and sat down, letting the scented air, a compound of sea
and trees, breathe over his body, naked save for the underpants.
He drank the bourbon down in two long
draughts and felt its friendly bite at the back of his
throat and in his stomach. He filled up his glass again,
this time with more ice to make it a weaker drink, and
sat back and thought about Scaramanga.</p>

<p class="pindent">What was the man doing now? Talking long-distance
with Havana or the States? Organizing things for tomorrow?
It would be interesting to see these fat, frightened
stockholders! If Bond knew anything, they would be a
choice bunch of hoods, the type that had owned the Havana
hotels and casinos in the old Batista days, the men
that held the stock in Las Vegas, that looked after the
action in Miami. And whose money was Scaramanga
representing? There was so much hot money drifting
around the Caribbean that it might be any of the syndicates,
any of the banana dictators from the islands or the
mainland. And the man himself? It had been damned
fine shooting that had killed the two birds swerving
through the window of 3½. How in hell was Bond going
to take him? On an impulse, Bond went over to his bed
and took the Walther from under the pillow. He slipped
out the magazine and pumped the single round onto the
counterpane. He tested the spring of the magazine and
of the breech and drew a quick bead on various objects
round the room. He found he was aiming an inch or so
high. But that would be because the gun was lighter
without its loaded magazine. He snapped the magazine
back and tried again. Yes, that was better. He pumped a
round into the breech, put up the safety, and replaced
the gun under the pillow. Then he went back to his
drink and picked up the book and forgot his worries in
the high endeavours of great men.</p>

<p class="pindent">The eggs came and were good. The <span class="it">mousseline</span> sauce
might have been mixed at Maxim’s. Bond had the tray
removed, poured himself a last drink and prepared for
bed. Scaramanga would certainly have a master key. Tomorrow,
Bond would whittle himself a wedge to jam the
door. For tonight, he upended his suitcase just inside
the door and balanced the three glasses on top of it. It
was a simple booby trap, but it would give him all the
warning he needed. Then he took off his shorts and got
into bed and slept.</p>

<p class="pindent">A nightmare woke him, sweating, around two in the
morning. He had been defending a fort. There were
other defenders with him, but they seemed to be wandering
around aimlessly, ineffectively, and when Bond
shouted to rally them, they seemed not to hear him. Out
on the plain, Scaramanga sat ass-backwards on the café
chair beside a huge golden cannon. Every now and then,
he put his long cigar to the touchhole, and there came a
tremendous flash of soundless flame. A black cannonball,
as big as a football, lobbed up high in the air and crashed
down into the fort with a shattering noise of breaking
timber. Bond was armed with nothing but a longbow,
but even this he could not fire because every time he
tried to fit the notch of the arrow into the gut the arrow
slipped out of his fingers to the ground. He cursed his
clumsiness. Any moment now and a huge cannonball
would land on the small open space where he was standing!
Out on the plain, Scaramanga reached his cigar to
the touchhole. The black ball soared up. It was coming
straight for Bond! It landed just in front of him and
came rolling very slowly towards him, getting bigger and
bigger, smoke and sparks coming from its shortening
fuse. Bond threw up an arm to protect himself. Painfully,
the arm crashed into the side of the night table,
and Bond woke up.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got out of bed, gave himself a cold shower, and
drank a glass of water. By the time he was back in bed,
he had forgotten the nightmare and he went quickly to
sleep and slept dreamlessly until 7:30 in the morning.
He put on swimming trunks, removed the barricade
from in front of the door, and went out into the passage.
To his left, a door into the garden was open and sun
streamed in. He went out and was walking over the
dewy grass towards the beach when he heard a curious
thumping noise from among the palms to his right. He
walked over. It was Scaramanga, in trunks, attended by a
good-looking young Negro holding a flame-coloured
terrycloth robe, doing exercises on a trampoline. Scaramanga’s
body gleamed with sweat in the sunshine as he
hurled himself high in the air from the stretched canvas
and bounded back, sometimes from his knees or his buttocks
and sometimes even from his head. It was an impressive
exercise in gymnastics. The prominent third
nipple over the heart made an obvious target! Bond
walked thoughtfully down to the beautiful crescent of
white sand fringed with gently clashing palm trees. He
dived in, and because of the other man’s example, swam
twice as far as he had intended.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond had a quick and small breakfast in his
room, dressed, reluctantly because of the heat, in his
dark blue suit, armed himself, and went for a walk
round the property. He quickly got the picture. The
night, and the lighted façade, had covered up a half-project.
The east wing on the other side of the lobby was
still lath and plaster. The body of the hotel—the restaurant,
nightclub, and living rooms that were the tail of
the T-shaped structure—were mockups, stages for a dress
rehearsal, hastily assembled with the essential props, carpets,
light fixtures, and a scattering of furniture, but
stinking of fresh paint and wood shavings. Perhaps fifty
men and women were at work, tacking up curtains, vacuuming
carpets, fixing the electricity, but no one was
employed on the essentials—the big cement mixers, the
drills, the ironwork that lay about behind the hotel like
the abandoned toys of a giant. At a guess, the place would
need another year and another few million pounds to become
what the plans had said it was to be. Bond saw
Scaramanga’s problem. Someone was going to complain
about this. Others would want to get out. But then again,
others would want to buy in, but cheaply, and use it as a
tax loss to set against more profitable enterprises elsewhere.
Better to have a capital asset, with the big tax concessions
that Jamaica gave, than pay the money to Uncle
Sam, Uncle Fidel, Uncle Leoni of Venezuela. So Scaramanga’s
job would be to blind his guests with pleasure,
send them back half-drunk to their syndicates. Would it
work? Bond knew such people and he doubted it. They
might go to bed drunk with a pretty coloured girl but
they would awake sober. Or else they wouldn’t have
their jobs, they wouldn’t be coming here with their discreet
briefcases.</p>

<p class="pindent">He walked farther back on the property. He wanted
to locate his car. He found it on a deserted lot behind
the west wing. The sun would get at it where it was, so
he drove it forward and into the shade of a giant ficus
tree. He checked the petrol and pocketed the ignition
key. There were not too many small precautions he
could take.</p>

<p class="pindent">On the parking lot the smell of the swamps was very
strong. While it was still comparatively cool, he decided
to walk farther. He soon came to the end of the young
shrubs and guinea grass the landscaper had laid on. Behind
these was desolation—a great area of sluggish
streams and swampland from which the hotel land had
been recovered. Egrets, shrikes, and Louisiana herons
rose and settled lazily, and there were strange insect
noises and the call of frogs and gekkos. On what would
probably be the border of the property, a biggish stream
meandered towards the sea, its muddy banks pitted with
the holes of land crabs and water rats. As Bond approached,
there was a heavy splash and a man-sized alligator
left the bank and showed its snout before submerging.
Bond smiled to himself. No doubt, if the hotel
got off the ground, all this area would be turned into an
asset. There would be native boatmen, suitably attired
as Arawak Indians, a landing stage, and comfortable
boats with fringed shades from which the guests could
view the “tropical jungle” for an extra ten dollars on the
bill.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond glanced at his watch. He strolled back. To the
left, not yet screened by the young oleanders and crotons
that had been planted for this eventual purpose, were
the kitchens and laundry and staff quarters, the usual
back quarters of a luxury hotel; and music, the heartbeat
thump of Jamaican calypso, came from their direction—presumably
the Kingston combo rehearsing. Bond
walked round and under the portico into the main
lobby. Scaramanga was at the desk talking to the manager.
When he heard Bond’s footsteps on the marble, he
turned and looked, and gave Bond a curt nod. He was
dressed as on the previous day, and the high white cravat
suited the elegance of the hall. He said “Okay, then” to
the manager and, to Bond, “Let’s go take a look at the
conference room.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond followed him through the restaurant door and
then through another door to the right that opened into
a lobby, one of whose walls was taken up with the glasses
and plates of a buffet. Beyond this was another door.
Scaramanga led the way through into what would one
day perhaps be a card room or writing room. Now there
was nothing but a round table in the centre of a wine-red
carpet and seven white leatherette armchairs with
scratchpads and pencils in front of them. The chair facing
the door, presumably Scaramanga’s, had a white
telephone in front of it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond went round the room and examined the windows
and the curtains and glanced at the wall brackets of
the lighting. He said, “The brackets could be bugged.
And of course there’s the telephone. Like me to go over
it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga looked at Bond stonily. He said, “No
need to. It’s bugged all right. By me. Got to have a record
of what’s said.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “All right, then. Where do you want me to
be?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Outside the door. Sitting reading a magazine or
something. There’ll be the general meeting this afternoon
around four. Tomorrow there’ll maybe be one or
two smaller meetings, maybe just me and one of the
guys. I don’t want any of these meetings to be disturbed.
Got it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Seems simple enough. Now, isn’t it about time you
told me the names of these men and more or less who
they represent and which ones, if any, you’re expecting
trouble from?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga said, “Take a chair and a paper and pencil.”
He strolled up and down the room. “First there’s
Mr. Hendriks. Dutchman. Represents the European
money, mostly Swiss. You needn’t bother with him. He’s
not the arguing type. Then there’s Sam Binion from Detroit.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“The Purple Gang?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga stopped in his stride and looked hard at
Bond. “These are all respectable guys, mister whoosis.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Hazard is the name.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“All right. Hazard, then. But respectable, you understand.
Don’t go getting the notion that this is another
Appalachia. These are all solid businessmen. Get me?
This Sam Binion, for instance. He’s in real estate. He
and his friends are worth maybe twenty million bucks.
See what I mean? Then there’s Leroy Gengerella. Miami.
Owns Gengerella Enterprises. Big shot in the entertainment
world. He may cut up rough. Guys in that
line of business like quick profits and a quick turnover.
And Ruby Rotkopf, the hotel man from Vegas. He’ll ask
the difficult questions because he’ll already know most of
the answers from experience. Hal Garfinkel from Chicago.
He’s in labour relations, like me. Represents a lot
of Teamster Union funds. He shouldn’t be any trouble.
Those unions have got so much money they don’t know
where to put it. That makes five. Last comes Louie Paradise
from Phoenix, Arizona. Owns Paradise Slots, the
biggest people in the one-armed bandit business. Got casino
interests too. I can’t figure which way he’ll bet.
That’s the lot.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“And who do you represent, Mr. Scaramanga?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Caribbean money.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Cuban?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I said Caribbean. Cuba’s in the Caribbean, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Castro or Batista?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The frown was back. Scaramanga’s right hand balled
into a fist. “I told you not to rile me, mister. So don’t go
prying into my affairs or you’ll get hurt. And that’s for
sure.” As if he could hardly control himself longer, the
big man turned on his heel and strode brusquely out of
the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond smiled. He turned back to the list in
front of him. A strong reek of high gangsterdom rose
from the paper. But the name he was most interested in
was Mr. Hendriks, who represented “European money.”
If that was his real name, and he was a Dutchman, so,
James Bond reflected, was he.</p>

<p class="pindent">He tore off three sheets of paper to efface the impression
of his pencil and walked out and along into the
lobby. A bulky man was approaching the desk from the
entrance. He was sweating mightily in his unseasonable
wooden-looking suit. He might have been anybody—an
Antwerp diamond merchant, a German dentist, a Swiss
bank manager. The pale, square-jowled face was totally
anonymous. He put a heavy briefcase on the desk and
said in a thick Central European accent, “I am Mr. Hendriks.
I think it is that you have a room for me, isn’t
it?”</p>
