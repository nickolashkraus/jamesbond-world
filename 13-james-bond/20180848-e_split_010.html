<p class="line9">The south coast of Jamaica is not as beautiful as the
north, and it is a long hundred-and-twenty-mile hack
over very mixed road surfaces from Kingston to Savannah
La Mar. Mary Goodnight had insisted on coming
along, “to navigate and help with the punctures.” Bond
had not demurred.</p>

<p class="pindent">Spanish Town, May Pen, Alligator Pond, Black
River, Whitehouse Inn, where they had luncheon—the
miles unrolled under the fierce sun until, late in the afternoon,
a stretch of good straight road brought them
among the spruce little villas, each with its patch of
brownish lawn, its bougainvillaea, and its single bed of
canna lilies and crotons, which make up the “smart”
suburbs of the modest little coastal township that is, in
the vernacular, Sav’ La Mar.</p>

<p class="pindent">Except for the old quarter on the waterfront, it is not
a typically Jamaican town, or a very attractive one. The
villas, built for the senior staff of the Frome sugar estates,
are drably respectable, and the small straight
streets smack of a most un-Jamaican bout of town planning
around the 1920s. Bond stopped at the first garage,
took in petrol, and put Mary Goodnight into a hired car
for the return trip. He had told her nothing of his assignment,
and she had asked no questions when Bond
told her vaguely that it was “something to do with
Cuba.” Bond said he would keep in touch when he
could, and get back to her when his job was done, and
then, businesslike, she was off back down the dusty road
and Bond drove slowly down to the waterfront. He identified
Love Lane, a narrow street of brokendown shops
and houses that meandered back into the town from the
jetty. He circled the area to get the neighbouring geography
clear in his mind and parked the car in a deserted
area near the spit of sand on which fishing canoes were
drawn up on raised stilts. He locked the car and sauntered
back and into Love Lane. There were a few people
about, poor people of the fisherman class. Bond bought a
packet of Royal Blend at a small general store that
smelled of spices. He asked where Number 3½ was and
got a look of polite curiosity. “Further up de street.
Mebbe a chain. Big house on de right.” Bond moved
over to the shady side and strolled on. He slit open
the packet with his thumbnail and lit a cigarette to
help the picture of an idle tourist examining a corner of
old Jamaica. There was only one big house on the right.
He took some time lighting the cigarette while he examined
it.</p>

<p class="pindent">It must once have had importance, perhaps as the private
house of a merchant. It was of two storeys with balconies
running all the way round and it was wooden
built with silvering shingles, but the gingerbread tracery
beneath the eaves was broken in many places and there
was hardly a scrap of paint left on the jalousies that closed
off all the upstairs windows and most of those below.
The patch of “yard” bordering the street was inhabited
by a clutch of vulturine-necked chickens that pecked at
nothing and three skeletal Jamaican black-and-tan
mongrels. They gazed lazily across the street at Bond
and scratched and bit at invisible flies. But in the background,
there was one very beautiful <span class="it">lignum vitae</span> tree
in full blue blossom. Bond guessed that it was as old as
the house—perhaps fifty years. It certainly owned the
property by right of strength and adornment. In its delicious
black shade a girl in a rocking chair sat reading a
magazine. At the range of about thirty yards she looked
tidy and pretty. Bond strolled up the opposite side of the
street until a corner of the house hid the girl. Then he
stopped and examined the house more closely.</p>

<p class="pindent">Wooden steps ran up to an open front door, over
whose lintel, whereas few of the other buildings in the
street bore numbers, a big enamelled metal sign announced
“3½” in white on dark blue. Of the two broad
windows that bracketed the door, the left-hand one was
shuttered, but the right-hand one was a single broad
sheet of rather dusty glass through which tables and
chairs and a serving counter could be seen. Over the
door a swinging sign said <span class="calibre2">DREAMLAND CAFÉ</span> in sun-bleached
letters, and round this window were advertisements
for Red Stripe beer, Royal Blend, Four Aces cigarettes,
and Coca-Cola. A hand-painted sign said <span class="calibre2">SNAX</span>
and, underneath, <span class="calibre2">HOT COCK SOUP FRESH DAILY</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked across the street and up the steps and
parted the bead curtain that hung over the entrance. He
walked over to the counter and was inspecting its contents—a
plate of dry-looking ginger cakes, a pile of packeted
banana crisps, and some jars—when he heard quick
steps outside. The girl from the garden came in. The
beads clashed softly behind her. She was an octoroon,
pretty, as in Bond’s imagination the word octoroon suggested.
She had bold, brown eyes, slightly uptilted at the
corners, beneath a fringe of silken black hair. (Bond reflected
that there would be Chinese blood somewhere in
her heredity.) She was dressed in a short frock of shocking
pink which went well with the coffee and cream of
her skin. Her wrists and ankles were tiny. She smiled politely.
The eyes flirted. “Evenin’.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Good evening. Could I have a Red Stripe?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sure.” She went behind the counter. She gave him a
quick glimpse of fine bosoms as she bent to the door of
the icebox—a glimpse not dictated by the geography of
the place. She nudged the door shut with a knee, deftly
uncapped the bottle, and put it on the counter beside an
almost clean glass. “That’ll be one and six.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond paid. She rang the money into the cash register.
Bond drew up a stool to the counter and sat down. She
rested her arms on the wooden top and looked across at
him. “Passing through?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“More or less. I saw this place was for sale in yesterday’s
<span class="it">Gleaner</span>. I thought I’d take a look at it. Nice big
house. Does it belong to you?”</p>

<p class="pindent">She laughed. It was a pity, because she was a pretty
girl, but the teeth had been sharpened by munching raw
sugar cane. “What a hope! I’m sort of, well sort of manager.
There’s the café”—she pronounced it caif—“and
mebbe you heard we got other attractions.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked puzzled. “What sort?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Girls. Six bedrooms upstairs. Very clean. It only cost
a pound. There’s Sarah up there now. Care to meet up
with her?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Not today, thanks. It’s too hot. But do you only have
one at a time?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“There’s Lindy, but she’s engaged. She’s a big girl. If
you like them big, she’ll be free in half an hour.” She
glanced at a kitchen clock on the wall behind her.
“Around six o’clock. It’ll be cooler then.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I prefer girls like you. What’s your name?”</p>

<p class="pindent">She giggled. “I only do it for love. I told you I just
manage the place. They call me Tiffy.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s an unusual name. How did you come by
it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“My momma had six girls. Called them all after flowers.
Violet, Rose, Cherry, Pansy, and Lily. Then when I
came, she couldn’t think of any more flower names so she
called me ‘Artificial.’ ” Tiffy waited for him to laugh.
When he didn’t, she went on. “When I went to school
they all said it was a wrong name and laughed at me and
shortened it to Tiffy and that’s how I’ve stayed.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, I think it’s a very pretty name. My name’s
Mark.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She flirted. “You a saint too?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No one’s ever accused me of it. I’ve been up at
Frome doing a job. I like this part of the island and it
crossed my mind to find some place to rent. But I want
to be closer to the sea than this. I’ll have to look around
a bit more. Do you rent rooms by the night?”</p>

<p class="pindent">She reflected. “Sure. Why not. But you may find it a
bit noisy. There’s sometimes a customer who’s taken
some drinks too many. And there’s not too much plumbing.”
She leaned closer and lowered her voice. “But I
wouldn’t have advised you to rent the place. The shingles
are in bad shape. Cost you mebbe five hunnerd,
mebbe a thousand, to get the roof done.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It’s nice of you to tell me that. But why’s the place
being sold? Trouble with the police?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Not so much. We operate a respectable place. But in
the <span class="it">Gleaner</span>, after Mr. Brown, that’s my boss, you read
that <span class="it">et ux</span>?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, seems that means ‘and his wife.’ And Mistress
Brown, Mistress Agatha Brown, she was Church of England,
but she just done gone to the Catholics. And
it seems they don’t hold with places like three-and-a-half,
not even when they’re decently run. And their
church here, just up the street, seems that needs a new
roof like here. So Mistress Brown figures to kill two birds
with the same stone and she goes on at Mr. Brown to
close the place down and sell it and with her portion she
goin’ fix the roof for the Catholics.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s a shame. It seems a nice quiet place. What’s
going to happen to you?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Guess I’ll move to Kingston. Live with one of my
sisters and mebbe work in one of the big stores—Issa’s
mebbe, or Nathan’s. Sav’ La Mar is sort of quiet.” The
brown eyes became introspective. “But I’ll sure miss the
place. Folks have fun here and Love Lane’s a pretty
street. We’re all friends up and down the Lane. It’s got
sort of, sort of. . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Atmosphere.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Right. That’s what it’s got. Like sort of old Jamaica.
Like it must have been in the old days. Everyone’s
friends with each other. Help each other when they have
trouble. You’d be surprised how often the girls do it for
free if the man’s a good feller, regular customer sort of,
and he’s short.” The brown eyes gazed inquiringly at
Bond to see if he understood the strength of the evidence.</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s nice of them. But it can’t be good for business.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She laughed. “This ain’t no business, Mister Mark.
Not while I’m running it. This is a public service, like
water and electricity and health and education and.
. . .” She broke off and glanced over her shoulder at
the clock which said 5:45. “Hell! You get me talking
so much I’ve forgot Joe and May. It’s their supper.” She
went to the café window and wound it down. At once,
from the direction of the <span class="it">lignum vitae</span> tree, two large
black birds, slightly smaller than ravens, whirled in, circled
the interior of the café amidst a metallic clangour of
song unlike the song of any other bird in the world, and
untidily landed on the counter within reach of Bond’s
hand. They strutted up and down imperiously, eyeing
Bond without fear from bold, golden eyes and went
through a piercing repertoire of tinny whistles and trills,
some of which required them to ruffle themselves up to
almost twice their normal size.</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiffy went back behind the bar, took two pennies out
of her purse, rang them up on the register, and took two
ginger cakes out of the flyblown display case. She broke
off bits and fed the two birds, always the smaller of the
two, the female, first, and they greedily seized the pieces
from her fingers and, holding the scraps to the wooden
counter with a claw, tore them into smaller fragments
and devoured them. When it was all over, and Tiffy had
chided them both for pecking her fingers, they made
small, neat white messes on the counter and looked
pleased with themselves. Tiffy took a cloth and cleaned
up the messes. She said, “We call them kling-klings but
learned folk call them Jamaican grackles. They’re very
friendly folk. The doctorbird, the humming bird with
the streamer tail, is the Jamaican national bird, but I
like these best. They’re not so beautiful, but they’re the
friendliest birds and they’re funny besides. They seem to
know it. They’re like naughty black thieves.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The kling-klings eyed the cake stand and complained
stridently that their supper was over. James Bond produced
twopence and handed it over. “They’re wonderful.
Like mechanical toys. Give them a second course
from me.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiffy rang up the money and took out two more cakes.
“Now listen, Joe and May. This nice gemmun’s been
nice to Tiffy and he’s now being nice to you. So don’t
you peck my fingers and make messes or mebbe he won’t
visit us again.” She was halfway through feeding the
birds when she cocked an ear. There was the noise of
creaking boards somewhere overhead and then the
sound of quiet footsteps treading stairs. All of a sudden
Tiffy’s animated face became quiet and tense. She whispered
to Bond: “That’s Lindy’s man. Important man.
He’s a good customer here. But he don’t like me because
I won’t go with him. So he can talk rough sometimes.
And he don’t like Joe and May because he reckons they
make too much noise.” She shooed the birds in the direction
of the open window, but they saw there was half
their cake to come and they just fluttered into the air
and then down to the counter again. Tiffy appealed to
Bond. “Be a good friend and just sit quiet whatever he
says. He likes to get people mad. And then. . . .” She
stopped. “Will you have another Red Stripe, mister?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bead curtains swished in the shadowy back of the
room.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had been sitting with his chin propped on his
right hand. He now dropped the hand to the counter
and sat back. The Walther PPK inside the waistband of
his trousers to the left of his flat stomach signalled its
presence to his skin. The fingers of his right hand curled
slightly, ready to receive its butt. He moved his left foot
off the rail of the stool onto the floor. He said, “That’d
be fine.” He unbuttoned his coat with his left hand and
then, with the same hand, took out his handkerchief and
wiped his face with it. “It always gets extra hot around
six before the Undertaker’s Wind has started to
blow.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Mister, the undertaker’s right here. You care to feel
his wind?”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond turned his head slowly. Dusk had crept
into the big room and all he could see was a pale, tall
outline. The man was carrying a suitcase. He put it
down on the floor and came forward. He must have been
wearing rubber-soled shoes for his feet made no sound.
Tiffy moved nervously behind the counter and a switch
clicked. Half a dozen low-voltage bulbs came to life in
rusty brackets around the walls.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said easily, “You made me jump.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga came up and leant against the counter.
The description in Records was exact, but it had not
caught the catlike menace of the big man, the extreme
breadth of the shoulders, and the narrow waist, or the
cold immobility of the eyes that now examined Bond
with an expression of aloof disinterest. He was wearing a
well-cut, single-breasted tan suit and co-respondent
shoes in brown and white. Instead of a tie, he wore a
high stock in white silk secured by a gold pin the shape
of a miniature pistol. There should have been something
theatrical about the getup but, perhaps because of
the man’s fine figure, there wasn’t.</p>

<p class="pindent">He said, “I sometimes make ’em dance. Then I shoot
their feet off.” There was no trace of a foreign accent
underneath the American.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “That sounds rather drastic. What do you
do it for?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“The last time it was five thousand dollars. Seems like
you don’t know who I am. Didn’t the cool cat tell you?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond glanced at Tiffy. She was standing very still, her
hands by her sides. The knuckles were white.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “Why should she? Why would I want to
know?”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a quick flash of gold. The small black hole
looked directly at Bond’s navel. “Because of this. What
are you doing here, stranger? Kind of a coincidence finding
a city slicker at three-and-a-half. Or at Sav’ La Mar
for the matter of that. Not by any chance from the police?
Or any of their friends?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Kamerad!” Bond raised his hands in mock surrender.
He lowered them and turned to Tiffy. “Who is this
man? A one-man takeover bid for Jamaica? Or a refugee
from a circus? Ask him what he’d like to drink. Whoever
he is, it was a good act.” James Bond knew that he had
very nearly pulled the trigger of the gun. Hit a gunman
in his vanity. . . . He had a quick vision of himself
writhing on the floor, his right hand without the power
to reach for his own weapon. Tiffy’s pretty face was no
longer pretty. It was a taut skull. She stared at James
Bond. Her mouth opened but no sound came from the
gaping lips. She liked him and she knew he was dead.
The kling-klings, Joe and May, smelled the same electricity.
With a tremendous din of metallic squawks, they
fled for the open window, like black thieves escaping
into the night.</p>

<p class="pindent">The explosions from the Colt .45 were deafening.
The two birds disintegrated against the violet backdrop
of the dusk, the scraps of feathers and pink flesh blasting
out of the yellow light of the café into the limbo of the
deserted street like shrapnel.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a moment of deafening silence. James
Bond didn’t move. He sat where he was, waiting for the
tension of the deed to relax. It didn’t. With an inarticulate
scream that was half a filthy word, Tiffy took James
Bond’s bottle of Red Stripe off the counter and clumsily
flung it. There came a distant crash of glass from the
back of the room. Then, having made her puny gesture,
Tiffy fell to her knees behind the counter and went
into sobbing hysterics.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond drank down the rest of his beer and got
slowly to his feet. He walked towards Scaramanga and
was about to pass him when the man reached out a languid
left arm and caught him at the biceps. He held the
snout of his gun to his nose, sniffing delicately. The expression
in the dead brown eyes was faraway. He said,
“Mister, there’s something quite extra about the smell of
death. Care to try it?” He held out the glittering gun as
if he was offering James Bond a rose.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stood quite still. He said, “Mind your manners.
Take your hand off me.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Scaramanga raised his eyebrows. The flat, leaden gaze
seemed to take in Bond for the first time.</p>

<p class="pindent">He released his grip.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond went on round the edge of the counter.
When he came opposite the other man, he found the
eyes were now looking at him with faint, scornful curiosity.
Bond stopped. The sobbing of the girl was the crying
of a small dog. Somewhere down the street a sound
system—a loudspeaker record player—began braying calypso.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked the man in the eye. He said, “Thanks.
I’ve tried it. I recommend the Berlin vintage nineteen
forty-five.” He smiled a friendly, only slightly ironical
smile. “But I expect you were too young to be at that
tasting.”</p>
