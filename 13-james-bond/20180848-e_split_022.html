<p class="line9">A week later, James Bond was sitting up in a chair, a
towel round his waist, reading Allen Dulles’ <span class="it">The Craft
of Intelligence</span> and cursing his fate. The hospital had
worked miracles on him, the nurses were sweet, particularly
the one he called The Mermaid, but he wanted to
be off and away. He glanced at his watch. Four o’clock.
Visiting time. Mary Goodnight would soon be here, and
he would be able to let off his pent-up steam on her.
Unjust perhaps, but he had already tongue-lashed everyone
in range in the hospital, and if she got into the field
of fire, that was just too bad!</p>

<p class="pindent">Mary Goodnight came through the door. Despite the
Jamaican heat, she was looking fresh as a rose. Damn
her! She was carrying what looked like a typewriter.
Bond recognized it as the Triple-X decyphering machine.
Now what?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond grunted surly answers to her inquiries after his
health. He said, “What in hell’s that for?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It’s an Eyes Only. Personal from M.,” she said excitedly.
“About thirty groups.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thirty groups! Doesn’t the old bastard know I’ve
only got one arm that’s working? Come on, Mary. You
get cracking. If it sounds really hot, I’ll take over.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Mary Goodnight looked shocked. Eyes Only was a top-sacred
prefix. But Bond’s jaw was jutting out dangerously.
Today was not a day for argument. She sat on the
edge of the bed, opened the machine, and took a cable
form out of her bag. She laid her shorthand book beside
the machine, scratched the back of her head with her
pencil to help work out the setting for the day—a complicated
sum involving the date and the hour of dispatch
of the cable—adjusted the setting on the central cylinder
and began cranking the handle. After each completed
word had appeared in the little oblong window at the
base of the machine, she recorded it in her book.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond watched her expression. She was pleased.
After a few minutes she read out:</p>

<p class="pindent">“<span class="calibre2">M PERSONAL FOR OHOHSEVEN EYES ONLY STOP YOUR REPORT
AND DITTO FROM TOP FRIENDS</span> [a euphemism for the
C.I.A.] <span class="calibre2">RECEIVED STOP YOU HAVE DONE WELL AND EXECUTED
AYE DIFFICULT AND HAZARDOUS OPERATION TO MY
ENTIRE REPEAT ENTIRE SATISFACTION STOP TRUST YOUR
HEALTH UNIMPAIRED</span> [Bond gave an angry snort] <span class="calibre2">STOP
WHEN WILL YOU BE REPORTING FOR FURTHER DUTY QUERY</span>.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Mary Goodnight smiled delightedly. “I’ve never seen
him be so complimentary! Have you, James? That repeat
of <span class="it">entire</span>! It’s tremendous!” She looked hopefully
for a lifting of the black clouds from Bond’s face.</p>

<p class="pindent">In fact, Bond was secretly delighted. He knew what
Mary couldn’t know—that M. was telling him that he
had won his spurs back. But he certainly wasn’t going to
show his pleasure to Mary Goodnight. Today she was
one of the wardresses confining him, tying him down.
He said grudgingly, “Not bad for the old man. But all
he wants is to get me back to that bloody desk. Anyway,
it’s a lot of jazz so far. What comes next?” He turned the
pages of his book, pretending as the little machine
whirred and clicked not to be interested.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, James!” Mary Goodnight exploded with excitement.
“Wait! I’m almost finished. It’s tremendous!”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I know,” commented Bond sourly. “Free luncheon
vouchers every second Friday. Key to M.’s personal lavatory.
New suit to replace the one that’s somehow got full
of holes.” But he kept his eyes fixed on the flitting fingers,
infected by Mary Goodnight’s excitement. What in
hell was she getting so steamed up about? And all on his
behalf! He examined her with approval. Perched there,
immaculate in her white tussore shirt and tight beige
skirt, one neat foot curled round the other in concentration,
the golden face under the shortish fair hair incandescent
with pleasure, she was, thought Bond, a girl to
have around always. As a secretary? As what? Mary
Goodnight turned, her eyes shining, and the question
went, as it had gone for weeks, without an answer.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Now, just listen to this, James.” She shook the notebook
at him. “And for heaven’s sake, stop looking so
curmudgeonly.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled at the word. “All right, Mary. Go ahead.
Empty the Christmas stocking on the floor. Hope it’s not
going to bust any stitches.” He put his book down on his
lap.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mary Goodnight’s face became portentous. She said
seriously, “Just listen to this!” She read very carefully:</p>

<p class="pindent">“<span class="calibre2">IN VIEW OF THE OUTSTANDING NATURE OF THE SERVICES
REFERRED TO ABOVE AND THEIR ASSISTANCE TO THE ALLIED
CAUSE COMMA WHICH IS PERHAPS MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN
YOU IMAGINE COMMA THE PRIME MINISTER PROPOSES TO
RECOMMEND TO HER MAJESTY QUEEN ELIZABETH THE IMMEDIATE
GRANT OF A KNIGHTHOOD STOP THIS TO TAKE THE
FORM OF THE ADDITION OF A KATIE AS PREFIX TO YOUR
CHARLIE MICHAEL GEORGE.</span>”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond uttered a defensive, embarrassed laugh.
“Good old cypherines. They wouldn’t think of just putting
<span class="calibre2"><span class="gesp">KCMG</span></span>—much too easy! Go ahead, Mary. This is
good!”</p>

<p class="pindent">“<span class="calibre2">IT IS COMMON PRACTICE TO INQUIRE OF PROPOSED RECIPIENT
WHETHER HE ACCEPTS THIS HIGH HONOUR BEFORE
HER MAJESTY PUTS HER SEAL UPON IT STOP WRITTEN LETTER
SHOULD FOLLOW YOUR CABLED CONFIRMATION OF ACCEPTANCE
PARAGRAPH THIS AWARD NATURALLY HAS MY
SUPPORT AND ENTIRE APPROVAL AND EYE SEND YOU MY
PERSONAL CONGRATULATIONS ENDIT MAILED-FIST.</span>”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond again hid himself behind the throwaway
line. “Why in hell does he always have to sign himself
Mailed-fist for M.? There’s a perfectly good English
word. Em. It’s a measure used by printers. But of course
it’s not dashing enough for the Chief. He’s a romantic at
heart like all the silly bastards who get mixed up with
the Service.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Mary Goodnight lowered her eyelashes. She knew that
Bond’s reflex concealed his pleasure—a pleasure he
wouldn’t for the life of him have displayed. Who
wouldn’t be pleased, proud? She put on a businesslike
expression. “Well, would you like me to draft something
for you to send? I can be back with it at six, and I know
they’ll let me in. I can check up the right sort of formula
with the High Commissioner’s staff. I know it begins
with ‘I present my humble duty to Her Majesty.’ I’ve had
to help with the Jamaica honours at New Year and her
birthday. Everyone seems to want to know the form.”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond wiped his forehead with his handkerchief.
Of course he was pleased! But above all pleased with
M.’s commendation. The rest, he knew, was not in his
stars. He had never been a public figure, and he did not
wish to become one. He had no prejudice against letters
after one’s name, or before it. But there was one thing
above all he treasured. His privacy. His anonymity. To
become a public person, a person, in the snobbish world
of England, of any country, who would be called upon
to open things, lay foundation stones, make after-dinner
speeches, brought the sweat to his armpits. “James
Bond!” No middle name. No hyphen. A quiet, dull,
anonymous name. Certainly he was a Commander in the
Special Branch of the R.N.V.R., but he rarely used the
rank. His C.M.G. likewise. He wore it perhaps once a
year, together with his two rows of lettuce, because there
was a dinner for the Old Boys—the fraternity of ex-Secret
Service men that went under the name of The Twin
Snakes Club. A grisly reunion held in the banqueting
hall at Blades, it gave enormous pleasure to a lot of people
who had been brave and resourceful in their day but
now had old men’s and old women’s diseases and talked
about dusty triumphs and tragedies. Tales which, since
they would never be recorded in the history books, must
be told again that night, over the Cockburn ’12, when
“The Queen” had been drunk, to some next-door neighbour
such as James Bond who was only interested in
what was going to happen tomorrow. That was when he
wore his lettuce and the C.M.G. below his black tie—to
give pleasure and reassurance to the Old Children at
their annual party. For the rest of the year, until May
polished them up for the occasion, the medals gathered
dust in some secret repository where May kept them.</p>

<p class="pindent">So now James Bond said to Mary Goodnight, avoiding
her eyes, “Mary, this is an order. Take down what follows
and send it tonight. Right?</p>

<p class="pindent">“Begins: quote <span class="calibre2">MAILED-FIST EYES ONLY</span> [Bond interjected,
I might have said Promoneypenny. When did
M. last touch a cypher machine?] <span class="calibre2">STOP YOUR</span> [Put in the
number, Mary] <span class="calibre2">ACKNOWLEDGED AND GREATLY APPRECIATED

BRACKET TO MAILED-FIST PLEASE PUT THIS IN THE
APPROPRIATE WORDS TO THE PRIME MINISTER STOP MY
PRINCIPAL REASON IS THAT EYE DONT WANT TO PAY MORE
AT HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS BRACKET.</span>”</p>

<p class="pindent">Mary Goodnight broke in, horrified. “James. The rest
is your business, but you really can’t say that last bit.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond nodded. “I was only trying it on you, Mary. All
right, let’s start again at the last stop. Write:</p>

<p class="pindent">“<span class="calibre2">EYE AM A SCOTTISH PEASANT AND EYE WILL ALWAYS
FEEL AT HOME BEING A SCOTTISH PEASANT AND EYE KNOW
COMMA SIR COMMA THAT YOU WILL UNDERSTAND MY PREFERENCE
AND THAT EYE CAN COUNT ON YOUR INDULGENCE
BRACKET LETTER CONFIRMING FOLLOWS IMMEDIATELY
ENDIT OHOHSEVEN.</span>”</p>

<p class="pindent">Mary Goodnight closed her book with a snap. She
shook her head. The golden hair danced angrily. “Well
really, James! Are you sure you don’t want to sleep on it?
I knew you were in a bad mood today. You may have
changed your mind by tomorrow. Don’t you want to go
to Buckingham Palace and see the Queen and the Duke
of Edinburgh and kneel and have your shoulder touched
with a sword and the Queen to say ‘Arise, Sir Knight’ or
whatever it is she does say?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled. “I’d like all those things. The romantic
streak of the S.I.S.—and of the Scot, for the matter of
that. I just refuse to call myself Sir James Bond. I’d
laugh at myself every time I looked in the mirror to
shave. It’s just not my line, Mary. The thought makes
me positively shudder. I know M.’ll understand. He
thinks much the same way about these things as I do.
Trouble was, he had to more or less inherit his K with
the job. Anyway, there it is and I shan’t change my
mind, so you can buzz that off, and I’ll write M. a letter
of confirmation this evening. Any other business?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well there is one thing, James.” Mary Goodnight
looked down her pretty nose. “Matron says you can leave
at the end of the week, but that there’s got to be another
three weeks’ convalescence. Had you got any plans
where to go? You have to be in reach of the hospital.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No ideas. What do you suggest?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, er, I’ve got this little villa up by Mona Dam,
James.” Her voice hurried. “It’s got quite a nice spare
room looking out over Kingston Harbour. And it’s cool
up there. And if you don’t mind sharing a bathroom.”
She blushed. “I’m afraid there’s no chaperone, but you
know, in Jamaica, people don’t mind that sort of thing.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What sort of thing?” said Bond, teasing her.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’t be silly, James. You know, unmarried couples
sharing the same house and so on.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh that sort of thing! Sounds pretty dashing to me.
By the way, is your bedroom decorated in pink, with
white jalousies, and do you sleep under a mosquito net?”</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked surprised. “Yes. How did you know?”
When he didn’t answer, she hurried on. “And James, it’s
not far from the Liguanea Club, and you can go there
and play bridge, and golf when you get better. There’ll
be plenty of people for you to talk to. And then of course
I can cook and sew buttons on for you and so on.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Of all the doom-fraught graffiti a woman can write on
the wall, those are the most insidious, the most deadly.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond, in the full possession of his senses, with
his eyes wide open, his feet flat on the linoleum floor,
stuck his head blithely between the mink-lined jaws of
the trap. He said, and meant it, “Goodnight. You’re an
angel.”</p>

<p class="pindent">At the same time, he knew, deep down, that love from
Mary Goodnight, or from any other woman, was not
enough for him. It would be like taking “a room with a
view.” For James Bond, the same view would always
pall.</p>
