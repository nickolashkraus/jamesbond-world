<p class="pindent">While Sluggsy made for the back door and went out
into the night, the thin man came slowly over to us. He
leaned against the edge of the counter. ‘Okay, folks.
Break it up. It’s midnight. We’re turning off the electricity.
My friend’s getting emergency oil-lamps from the
storehouse. No sense wasting juice. Mr Sanguinetti’s
orders.’ The words were friendly and reasonable. Had
they decided to give up their plans, whatever they were,
because of this man Bond? I doubted it. The thoughts
that listening to James Bond’s story had driven away
came flooding back. I was going to have to sleep with
these two men in the adjoining cabins on both sides
of me. I <span class="it">must</span> make my room impregnable. But they
had the pass-key! I must get this man Bond to help
me.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond yawned hugely. ‘Well, I’ll certainly be
glad of some sleep. Came a long way today and I’ve
got plenty more to cover tomorrow. And you must be
ready for bed, too, with all your worries.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Come again, mister?’ The thin man’s eyes had sharpened.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s pretty responsible job you’ve got.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What job’s that?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, being an insurance assessor. On a valuable
property like this. Must be worth half a million dollars,
I’d say. By the way, are either of you bonded?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No, we ain’t. Mr Sanguinetti don’t need to bond no
one what works for him.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s a great compliment to his staff. Must have
good men. Quite right to put a lot of trust in
them. Incidentally, what’s the name of his insurance
company?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Metro Accident and Home.’ The thin man still
leaned relaxed against the counter, but the grey face
was now tense. ‘Why? What’s it to you, mister? Suppose
you quit with the double-talk and say what’s on your
mind.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said carelessly, ‘Miss Michel here was telling
me the motel hadn’t been doing so well. I gather the
place hasn’t been accepted for membership in Quality
Courts or Holiday Inns or Congress. Difficult to do
much trade without one of those affiliations. And all
this trouble to send up you fellows to count the spoons
and turn off the electric light and so on.’ James Bond
looked sympathetic. ‘Just crossed my mind that the
business might be on the rocks. Too bad if it is. Nice
set-up here, and a fine site.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The red fleck that I had seen once, terribly, before
was now in the thin man’s eyes. He said softly, ‘Just
suppose you bag your lip, mister. I ain’t standin’ for
no more limey cracks, get me? You suggestin’ this ain’t
legit? Mebbe you think we set one up, huh?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now don’t burn yourself up, Mr Horowitz. No
need to sing the weeps.’ James Bond smiled broadly.
‘You see I know the lingo, too.’ His smile suddenly
went. ‘And I also know where it comes from. Now, <span class="it">do</span>
you get <span class="it">me</span>?’</p>

<p class="pindent">I suppose he meant this was gangster, jailbird
language. The thin man certainly thought so. He looked
startled, but now he had conquered his anger and he
just said, ‘Okay, wise guy. I’ve got the photo. You
gum-shoes are all the same—looking for dirt where
there ain’t none. Now, where in hell’s that pal of mine?
C’mon. Let’s hit the pad.’</p>

<p class="pindent">As we filed out through the back door, the lights
went out. James Bond and I stopped, but the thin man
went on along the covered way as if he could see in
the dark. Sluggsy appeared round the corner of the
building carrying two oil-lamps. He handed one to
each of us. His naked face, yellow in the light, split
into a grin. ‘Happy dreams, folks!’</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond followed me over to my cabin and came
inside. He shut the door. ‘Damned if I know what
they’re up to, but the first thing to do is see that you’re
properly closed down for the night. Now then, let’s
see.’ He prowled round the room, examining the
window fastenings, inspecting the hinges on the door,
estimating the size of the ventilator louvres. He seemed
satisfied. He said, ‘There’s only the door. You say
they’ve got the master key. We’ll wedge the door, and
when I’ve gone just move the desk over as an extra
barricade.’ He went into the bathroom, tore off strips
of lavatory paper, moistened them and made them
into firm wedges. He rammed several under the door,
turned the handle and pulled. They held, but could
have been shaken loose by ramming. He took the
wedges out again and gave them to me. Then he put
his hand to the belt of his trousers and took out a
short, stumpy revolver. ‘Ever fired one of these
things?’</p>

<p class="pindent">I said I’d shot at rabbits with a long-barrelled .22
target pistol when I was young.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, this is a Smith and Wesson Police Positive. A
real stopper. Remember to aim low. Hold your arm
out straight like this.’ He showed me. ‘And try to
squeeze the trigger and not snatch at it. But it won’t
really matter. I’ll hear it and I’ll come running. Now
remember. You’ve got absolute protection. The
windows are good solid stuff and there’s no way of
getting in between the glass slats, short of smashing
them.’ He smiled. ‘Trust these motel designers. They
know all there is to know about break-ins. These hoodlums
won’t take a shot at you through them in the
dark, but, just in case, leave your bed where it is and
make up a camp bed with some cushions and bedding
in that far corner on the floor. Put the gun under your
pillow. Pull the desk in front of the door and balance
the television set on the edge of it so that if anyone
barges the door they knock it off. That’ll wake you
and then you just fire a shot through the door, close
to the handle, where the man will be standing, and
listen for the squawk. Got it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">I said yes, as happily as I could, and wished he would
stay in the room with me. But I hadn’t the guts to ask
him, and anyway he seemed to have his own plans.</p>

<p class="pindent">He came up to me and kissed me gently on the lips.
I was so surprised I just stood there. He said lightly,
‘I’m sorry, Viv, but you’re a beautiful girl. In those
overalls you’re the prettiest garage-hand I’ve ever seen.
Now don’t you worry. Get some sleep. I’ll keep an eye
on you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I threw my arms round his neck and kissed him
back—hard, on the lips. I said, ‘You’re the most
wonderful man I’ve ever met in my life. Thank you
for being here. And please, James. Be careful! You
haven’t seen them like I have. They’re really tough.
Please don’t get hurt.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He kissed me back, but only lightly, and I let go of
him. He said, ‘Don’t worry. I’ve seen this sort before.
Now you do all I told you and get off to sleep. ’Night,
Viv.’</p>

<p class="pindent">And then he had gone.</p>

<p class="pindent">I stood for a moment looking at the closed door,
and then I went and brushed my teeth and got ready
for bed. I looked at myself in the mirror. I looked like
hell—washed out, no make-up, and deep circles under
my eyes. What a day! And now this! I mustn’t lose
him! I mustn’t let him go! But I knew in my heart that
I had to. He would go on alone and I would have to,
too. No woman had ever held this man. None ever
would. He was a solitary, a man who walked alone and
kept his heart to himself. He would hate involvement.
I sighed. All right. I would play it that way. I would
let him go. I wouldn’t cry when he did. Not even
afterwards. Wasn’t I the girl who had decided to operate
without a heart?</p>

<p class="pindent">Silly idiot! Silly, infatuated goose! This was a fine
time to maunder like a girl in a woman’s magazine! I
shook my head angrily and went into the bedroom
and got on with what I had to do.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was still blowing hard and the pine trees clashed
fiercely outside my back window. The moon, filtering
through high scudding clouds, lit up the two high
squares of glass at each end of the room and shone
eerily through the thin, red-patterned curtains. When
the moon went behind the clouds, the blocks of blood-red
photographer’s light went dark and there was only
the meagre pool of yellow from the oil-lamp. Without
the brightness of electricity, there was a nasty little
movie-set feeling about the oblong room. The corners
were dark and the room seemed to be waiting for a
director to call people out of the shadows and tell
them what to do.</p>

<p class="pindent">I tried not to be nervous. I put my ears to the
connecting walls to right and left, but across the space
of the car-ports I could hear nothing. Before I had
set up my barricade I had softly opened the door and
gone out and looked round. There had been a glimmer
of light from Numbers 8 and 10 and from James
Bond’s Number 40 away down to the left. Everything
had been peaceful, everything quiet. Now I stood in
the middle of the room and had a last look round. I
had done everything he had told me to do. I remembered
the prayers I was going to say and I knelt down
there and then on the carpet and said them. I thanked,
but I also asked. Then I took two aspirin, turned down
the light and blew across the glass chimney to put it
out, and went over to my floor bed in the corner. After
unzipping the front of my overalls and unlacing but
not removing my shoes, I curled myself up in the
blankets.</p>

<p class="pindent">I never take aspirin or any other pills. These, after
carefully reading the instructions, I had taken from the
little first-aid kit my practical mind had told me to
include in my scrap of luggage. I was anyway exhausted,
beat to the wide, and the pills, to me as strong as
morphia, soon sent me off into a delicious half-sleep
in which there was no danger but only the dark, exciting
face and the new-found knowledge that there really
did exist such men. Soppier even than that, I remembered
the first touch of his hand holding the lighter
and thought carefully about each kiss separately, and
then, but only after vaguely remembering the gun and
slipping my hand under the pillow to make sure it was
there, I went happily to sleep.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">The next thing I knew I was wide awake. I lay for a
moment remembering where I was. There was a lull
in the wind and it was very quiet. I found I was lying
on my back. That was what had awakened me! I lay
for a moment looking across the room at the square
of red high up on the opposite wall. The moon was
out again. How deathly quiet it was! The silence was
warm and embracing after the hours of storm. I began
to feel drowsy and I turned over on my side so that I
lay facing into the room. I closed my eyes. But, as
sleep held out her hands to me again, something
nagged at my mind. My eyes, before I had closed them,
had noticed something unusual in the room. Unwillingly,
I opened them again. It took minutes to
recognize again what I had seen. The faintest chinks
of light were shining from between the door frames
of the clothes cupboard up against the opposite
wall.</p>

<p class="pindent">How stupid! I hadn’t closed the doors properly and
the automatic ‘courtesy’ light inside hadn’t switched
itself off. Reluctantly I got out of bed. What a bore!
And then, after I had taken only two steps across the
room, I suddenly remembered. But there wouldn’t be
a light inside the cupboard! The electricity was switched
off!</p>

<p class="pindent">I stood for a moment, my hand up to my mouth,
and then, as I turned to dive for the gun, the doors
of the cupboard burst open and the crouching figure
of Sluggsy darted out and, a flashlight in one hand
and something swinging from the other, he was on
top of me.</p>

<p class="pindent">I think I gave a shrill scream, but perhaps it was
only within me. The next moment something exploded
against the side of my head and I felt myself crash to
the floor. Then all was darkness.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">My first sensations on coming round were of terrific
heat and of being dragged along the ground. Then I
smelled the burning and saw the flames and I tried to
scream. I realized that nothing was coming out of my
mouth but an animal whimpering, and I began to kick
with my feet. But the hands held my ankles firmly and
then suddenly, with painful bumps that added to the
frightful pain in my head, I found myself being dragged
into wet grass and tree branches. Suddenly my feet
were laid down and there was a man on his knees
beside me and his firm hand over my mouth. A voice
close to my ear, James Bond’s voice, whispered urgently,
‘Don’t make a sound! Lie still! It’s all right. It’s me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I put a hand out to him and felt his shoulder. It was
naked. I pressed it to reassure him and the hand came
away from my mouth. He whispered, ‘Wait there! Don’t
move! Be back in a second,’ and he slipped noiselessly
away.</p>

<p class="pindent">Noiselessly? It wouldn’t have mattered how much
noise he made. There was a tremendous roar and
crackle of flames behind me and orange light flickered
against the trees. I got carefully to my knees and painfully
turned my head. A great wall of flame extended
down to my right all along the row of cabins. God,
what he had saved me from! I felt my body and put
my hands up to my hair. I was untouched. There was
only the throbbing bruise at the back of my head. I
found I could stand, and I got up and tried to think
what had happened. But I could remember nothing
after I had got hit. So they must have set fire to the
place and James had somehow got to me in time and
pulled me out into the trees at the back!</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a rustle among the trees and he was beside
me. He was wearing no shirt or coat, but there was
some kind of harness across the sunburned, sweating
chest that glistened in the light of the flames, and a
heavy-looking automatic hung, butt down, below his
left armpit. His eyes were bright with tension and
excitement and his smoke-streaked face and tousled
hair made him look piratical and rather frightening.</p>

<p class="pindent">He smiled grimly. He nodded in the direction of
the flames. ‘That’s the game. Burn the place down
for the insurance. They’re just fixing the flames to
reach the lobby building, sprinkling thermite dust along
the covered way. I couldn’t care less. If I took them
on now, I’d only be saving Mr Sanguinetti’s property
for him. With us as witnesses, he won’t even smell the
insurance. And he’ll be in jail. So we’ll just wait a bit
and let him have a total loss on his books.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I suddenly thought of my precious belongings. I
said humbly, ‘Can we save the Vespa?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s all right. You’ve only lost those glad-rags—if
you left them in the bathroom. I got the gun when I
got you, and I slung the saddle-bags out. I’ve just been
salvaging the Vespa. It looks in good shape. I’ve made
a cache of everything in the trees. Those car-ports will
be the last things to go. They’ve got masonry on both
sides. They’ve used thermite bombs in each of the
cabins. Better than petrol. Less bulky and they leave
no traces for the insurance sleuths.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But you might have got burned!’</p>

<p class="pindent">His smile flashed white in the shadows. ‘That’s
why I took my coat off. I must look respectable in
Washington.’</p>

<p class="pindent">It didn’t seem funny to me. ‘But what about your
shirt?’</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a crash and a great shower of sparks way
down the line of cabins. James Bond said, ‘There goes
my shirt. Roof falling in on top of it.’ He paused and
wiped his hand down his dirty sweating face so that
the black smudged even worse. ‘I had a feeling something
like this was going to happen. Perhaps I should
have been more ready for it than I was. I could have
gone and changed the wheel on my car, for instance.
If I’d done that we could get out now. We could work
our way round the end of the cabins and make a dash
for it. Get to Lake George or Glens Falls and send
the cops along. But I thought that if I fixed the car
our friends would have an excuse to tell me to get
moving. I could have refused, of course, or said that
I wouldn’t go without you, but I thought that might
lead to shooting. I’d be lucky to beat those two unless
I shot first. And with me out of the picture, you’d
have been back where we started. That would have
been bad. You were a major part of their plan.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I felt I was all along. I didn’t know why. I knew the
way they were treating me meant that I didn’t matter,
that I was expendable. What did they want to use me
for?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You were to have been the cause of the fire. The
evidence for Sanguinetti would have been that the
managers, this Phancey couple, and of course they’re
in it up to their necks,’—I remembered the way their
attitude to me had changed on the last day; the way
they too had treated me with contempt, as rubbish, as
something that was to be thrown away—‘they would
say that they had told you to turn off the electricity—perfectly
reasonable as the place was closing down—and
use an oil-lamp for the last night. The remains
of the oil-lamp would have been found. You had gone
to sleep with the light on and somehow upset it. The
whole place blazed up and that was that. The buildings
had a lot of timber in them and the wind did the rest.
My turning-up was a nuisance, but not more than that.
My remains would have been found too—or at any
rate my car and wrist watch and the metal from my
bag. I don’t know what they’d have done about my
gun and the one under your pillow. Those might have
got them into trouble. The police would have checked
the car with Canada and then the numbers of the guns
with England and that would have identified me. So
why was my other gun under your pillow? That might
have made the police think. If we were, well, sort of
lovers, why was I sleeping so far away from you?
Perhaps we had both been very proper and slept as
far apart as possible and I had insisted that you have
one of my guns to protect a lonely girl in the night. I
don’t know how they would have worked it out. But
my guess is that our friends, once I told them I was a
policeman, may have thought about guns and other
incriminating hardware that wouldn’t be destroyed in
the fire and might have waited a few hours and then
gone in and raked about in the ashes to take care of
that sort of trouble. They’d have been careful about
their raking, and of their footprints in the cinders, of
course. But then these people are pros.’ His mouth
turned down. ‘By their standards, that is.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But why didn’t they kill you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘They did, or rather they thought they had. When I
left you and went along to my cabin, I reckoned that
if anything was going to happen to you they would
get rid of me first. So I rigged up a dummy in my
bed. A good one. I’ve done it before and I’ve got the
trick. You mustn’t only have something that looks like
a body in the bed. You can do that with pillows and
towels and bedding. You must also have something
that looks like hair on the pillow. I did that with handfuls
of pine needles, just enough to make a dark clump
on the pillow with the sheets drawn up to it—very
artistic. Then I hung my shirt over the back of a chair
beside the bed—another useful prop that conveys the
idea that the man belonging to the shirt is inside the
bed—and I left the oil-lamp burning low, close to the
bed to help their marksmanship—if any. I put
amateurish wedges under the door and propped a
chair-back under the door handle to show a natural
sense of precaution. Then I took my bag round to the
back and waited in the trees.’ James Bond gave a sour
laugh. ‘They gave me an hour and then they came so
softly that I didn’t hear a thing. Then there was the
bang of the door being forced and a series of quick
clonks—they were using a silencer—and then the
whole interior of the cabin went bright with the thermite.
I thought I had been very clever, but it turned
out I very nearly wasn’t clever enough. It took me
almost five minutes to work my way up to your cabin
through the trees. I wasn’t worried. I thought it would
take them all that to get into your cabin and I was
ready to break out in the open if I heard your gun.
But some time this evening, probably when Sluggsy
was making the cabin inspection you told me about,
he had pick-axed a hole in the wall behind your clothes
cupboard, leaving only the plaster-board lining to be
cut through with a sharp knife. He may or may not
have put the stone loosely back. I don’t know. Anyway,
he didn’t need to. There was no occasion for either of
us to go into the car-port of Number 8, and no reason
to. If you had been here alone, they would have seen
to it that you kept away from there. Anyway, the first
thing I knew was seeing the light of the thermite from
your cabin. Then I ran like hell, dodging across the
open back of the car-ports as I heard them coming
back down the line, opening the doors of the cabins
and tossing bombs in and then carefully shutting the
doors to make it look tidy.’</p>

<p class="pindent">During all this while, James Bond had been glancing
from time to time at the roof of the lobby building
that we could just see over the tops of the flaming
cabins. Now he said casually. ‘They’ve set it going. I’ll
have to get after them. How are you feeling, Viv? Any
stuffing left? How’s the head?’</p>

<p class="pindent">I said impatiently, ‘Oh, I’m all right. But James, do
you have to go after them? Let them get away. What
do they matter? You might get hurt.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He said firmly, ‘No, darling. They almost killed both
of us. Any minute now they may come back and find
the Vespa gone. Then we’ll have lost the surprise factor.
And I can’t let them get away with it. These are killers.
They’ll be off killing someone else tomorrow.’ He
smiled cheerfully. ‘Besides, they ruined my shirt!’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, then you must let me help.’ I put my hand out
to him. ‘And you will take care, won’t you? I can’t do
without you. I don’t want to be alone again.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He ignored my hand. He said, almost coldly, ‘Now
don’t hang on my gun arm, there’s a good girl. This
is something I’ve got to do. It’s just a job. Now,’ he
handed me the Smith and Wesson, ‘you move quietly
up in the trees to the car-port of Number 3. That’s in
the dark and the wind’s blowing the fire the other way.
You can watch from there without being seen. If I
need help, I’ll know where to find you, so don’t budge.
If I call, come running fast. If anything happens to
me, get moving along the shore of the lake and work
your way as far as you can. After this fire, there’ll be
plenty of police along tomorrow, and you can smuggle
yourself back and contact one of them. They’ll believe
you. If they argue, tell them to ring up CIA in
Washington, the Central Intelligence Agency, and you’ll
see plenty of action. Just say who I was. I’ve got a
number in my outfit—sort of recognition number.
It’s 007. Try not to forget it.’</p>
