<p class="pindent">I hoisted myself up on to the drain board of the sink
just beside him so that he could talk to me quietly—and
so that I could be near to him. I refused another cigarette,
and he lit one and gazed for a long minute into
the mirror watching the two gangsters. I looked, too.
The two men just stared back with a passive, indifferent
hostility that seeped steadily across the room like
poison gas. I didn’t much like their indifference and
their watchfulness. It seemed so powerful, so implacable,
as if the odds were on their side and they had
all the time in the world. But this James Bond didn’t
seem worried. He just seemed to be weighing them
up, like a chess player. There was a certitude of power,
of superiority, in his eyes that worried me. He hadn’t
seen these men in action. He couldn’t possibly know
what they were capable of, how at any moment they
might just blaze away with their guns, blowing our
heads off like coconuts in a circus sideshow, and then
toss our bodies in the lake with stones to keep them
down. But then James Bond began talking, and I forgot
my nightmares and just watched his face and
listened.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘In England,’ he said, ‘when a man, or occasionally
a woman, comes over from the other side, from the
Russian side, with important information, there’s a
fixed routine. Take Berlin, for instance, and that’s the
most usual come-over route. To begin with they get
taken to intelligence headquarters and get treated at
first with extra suspicion. That’s to try and take care
of double agents—people who pretend to come over
and, once they’ve been cleared by security, begin spying
on us from inside, so to speak, and pass their stuff
back to the Russians. There are also triple agents—people
who do what the doubles have done, but change
their minds and, under our control, pass phoney intelligence
back to the Russians. Do you understand? It’s
nothing but a complicated game, really. But then so’s
international politics, diplomacy—all the trappings of
nationalism and the power complex that goes on
between countries. Nobody will stop playing the game.
It’s like the hunting instinct.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, I see. It all seems idiotic to my generation. Like
playing that old game “Attaque”, really. We need some
more Jack Kennedys. It’s all these old people about.
They ought to hand the world over to younger people
who haven’t got the idea of war stuck in their subconscious.
As if it were the only solution. Like beating
children. It’s much the same thing. It’s all out of date—Stone
Age stuff.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He smiled. ‘As a matter of fact I agree, but don’t
spread your ideas too widely or I’ll find myself out of
a job. Anyway, once the come-over has got through
the strainer in Berlin, he’s flown to England and the
bargain gets made—you tell us all you know about
the Russian rocket sites and in exchange we’ll give you
a new name, a British passport and a hideout where
the Russians will never find you. That’s what they’re
most frightened of, of course, the Russians getting
after them and killing them. And, if they play, they get
the choice of Canada, Australia, New Zealand or
Africa. So, when they’ve told all they know, they get
flown out to the country they’ve chosen, and there a
reception committee run by the local police, a very
hush-hush affair, of course, takes them over and they’re
gradually eased into a job and into a community just
as if they were a bona fide immigrant. It nearly always
works all right. They get homesick to begin with, and
have trouble settling down, but some member of the
reception committee will always be at hand to give
them any help they need.’</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond lit another cigarette. ‘I’m not telling you
anything the Russians don’t know. The only secret side
of the business is the addresses of these people.
There’s a man I’ll call Boris. He’s been settled in
Canada, in Toronto. He was a prize—twenty-four carat.
He was a top naval constructor in Kronstadt—high
up in their nuclear submarine team. He got away to
Finland and then to Stockholm. We picked him up
and flew him to England. The Russians don’t often
say anything about their defectors—just curse and let
them go. If they’re important, they round up their
families and ship them off to Siberia—to frighten other
waverers. But it was different with Boris. They sent
out a general call to their secret services to eliminate
him. As luck would have it, an organization called
<span class="calibre10">SPECTRE</span> somehow listened in.’</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond took a hard look at the two men on
the other side of the room. They hadn’t moved. They
sat there and watched and waited. What for? James
Bond turned back to me. ‘I’m not boring you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, no. Of course not. It’s thrilling. These <span class="calibre10">SPECTRE</span>
people. Haven’t I read about them somewhere? In the
papers?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I expect you have. Less than a year ago there was
this business of the stolen atomic bombs. It was called
Operation <span class="it">Thunderball</span>. Remember?’ His eyes went far
away. ‘It was in the Bahamas.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, yes. Of course I remember. It was in all the
papers. I could hardly believe it. It was like something
out of a thriller. Why? Were you mixed up in it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond smiled. ‘On the sidelines. But the point
is that we never cleaned up <span class="calibre10">SPECTRE</span>. The top man
got away. It was a kind of independent spy network—“The
Special Executive for Counter-espionage,
Terrorism, Revenge and Extortion” they call themselves.
Well, they’ve got going again and, as I say, they
came to hear that the Russians wanted Boris killed and
somehow they found out where he was. Don’t ask me
how. These people are too damned well informed for
comfort. So they put it to the top KGB man in Paris,
the local head of the Russian Secret Service, that they’d
do the job for one hundred thousand pounds. Presumably
Moscow agreed, because the next thing that
happened was that Ottawa—the famous Mounties—got
on to us. They have a Special Branch that we work
with pretty closely on this sort of thing, and they
reported that there was an ex-Gestapo man in Toronto,
chap called Horst Uhlmann, making contact with the
gangs there, and did we know anything about him? It
seemed he wanted some unspecified foreigner bumped
off and was prepared to pay fifty thousand dollars for
the job. Well, two and two got put together and some
bright chap in our show had a hunch this might be an
attempt on Boris by the Russians. So,’ James Bond’s
mouth curled down, ‘I was sent out to look into the
business.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He smiled at me. ‘You wouldn’t rather switch on the
television?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, no. Go on please.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, you know they’ve been having a lot of trouble
in Toronto. It’s anyway a tough town, but now gang
war has broken out in a big way, and you probably
read that the Mounties even went so far as to call in
two top CID sleuths from Scotland Yard to help them
out. One of these CID chaps had managed to plant
a smart young Canadian in “The Mechanics”, which
is the name of the toughest Toronto gang, with
affiliations over the border with Chicago and Detroit.
And it was this young man who got wind of Uhlmann
and what he wanted done. Well, I and my Mountie
pals went to work and to cut a long story short we
found out that it <span class="it">was</span> Boris who was the target and
that The Mechanics had agreed to do the job last
Thursday—that’s just about a week ago. Uhlmann had
gone to ground and we couldn’t get a smell of him.
All we could discover from our man with The
Mechanics was that he had agreed to lead the murder
squad that was to consist of three top gunmen from
the mob. It was to be a frontal attack on the apartment
where Boris lived. Nothing fancy. They were just going
to blast their way through the front door with sub-machine-guns,
shoot him to bits, and get away. It was
to be at night, just before midnight, and The Mechanics
would mount a permanent watch on the apartment
house to see that Boris came home from his job and
didn’t go out again.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, apart from protecting Boris, my main job was
to get this Horst Uhlmann, because by now we were
as certain as could be that he was a <span class="calibre10">SPECTRE</span> man,
and one of my jobs is to go after these people wherever
they show up. Of course, we couldn’t leave Boris
in danger, but if we got him away to safety there would
be no attempt on his life and so no Uhlmann. So I
had to make a rather unpleasant suggestion.’ James
Bond smiled grimly. ‘Unpleasant for me, that is. From
his photographs, I had noticed that there was a
superficial resemblance between Boris and me—about
my age, tall, dark, clean-shaven—so I took a look at
him from a ghost car one day—that’s an undercover
prowl car—and watched how he walked and what he
wore. Then I suggested that we get Boris away on the
day before the murder job, and that I should take his
place on the last walk back to his apartment.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I couldn’t help saying anxiously, ‘Oh, but you
shouldn’t have taken the risk. Supposing they’d changed
the plan. Supposing they’d decided to do it as you
walked down the street, or with a time bomb or something!’</p>

<p class="pindent">He shrugged. ‘We thought of all that. It was a calculated
risk and it’s those I’m paid for taking.’ He smiled.
‘Anyway, here I am. But it wasn’t nice walking down
that street, and I was glad to get inside. The Mounties
had taken over the flat opposite to Boris and I knew
I was all right and simply had to play the tethered goat
while the sportsmen shot the wild game. I could have
stayed out of the flat, hidden somewhere in the
building until it was all over, but I had a hunch that
the goat must be a real goat, and I was right, because
at eleven o’clock the telephone rang and a man’s voice
said, “Is that Mr Boris?” giving his assumed name. I
said, “Yes. Who is dat?” trying to sound foreign, and
the man said, “Thank you. Telephone Directory here.
We’re just checking the subscribers in your district.
’Night.” I said goodnight and thanked my stars I had
been there to take the bogus call that was to make
sure Boris was at home.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The last hour was nervous work. There was going
to be a lot of gunfire and probably a lot of death, and
no one likes the prospect of those things even if they
don’t expect to be hit. I had a couple of guns, heavy
ones that really stop people, and at ten to twelve I
took up my position to the right of the door in an
angle of solid masonry and got ready just in case
Uhlmann or one of the hoodlums managed to bust
through the Mounties across the passage. To tell you
the truth, as the minutes went by and I could imagine
the killer car coming down the street and the men
piling out and running softly up the stairs, I wished I
had accepted the Mounties’ offer that one of their
men should share this vigil, as they called it, with me.
But it would have been a five-hour <span class="it">tête-à-tête</span> and, apart
from not knowing what we would talk about during
all that time, I’ve always had a preference for operating
alone. It’s just the way I’m made. Well, the minutes
and the seconds ticked by and then, bang on time, at
five minutes to midnight, I heard a rush of rubber
soles on the stairs and then all hell broke loose.’</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond paused. He rubbed a hand down over
his face. It was a gesture that was either to clear his
mind’s eye or to try and wipe some memory away from
it. Then he lit another cigarette and went on.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I heard the lieutenant in charge of the Mountie
party shout, “It’s the law! Get ’em up!” And then there
was a mixture of single shots and bursts from the
chopper’—he grinned—‘sorry, sub-machine-gun—and
somebody screamed. Then the lieutenant shouted,
“Get that man!” and the next moment the lock blew
off the door beside me and a man charged in. He held
a smoking machine-gun tight against the hip, which is
the way to use them, and he whirled from right to left
in the bedsitter looking for Boris. I knew it was
Uhlmann, the ex-Gestapo man. One’s had to get to
know the smell of a German, and of a Russian for
the matter of that, in my line of work, and I had him
in my sights. I shot at his gun and blasted it out of
his hands. But he was quick. He jumped behind the
open door. The door was only a thin bit of wood. I
couldn’t take a chance on him having another gun and
firing first, so I sprayed a wide Z of bullets through
the wood, bending my knees lower as I did so. Just as
well I did this, because he fired a quick burst that nearly
parted my hair when I was almost on my knees. But
two of my bullets had got him, in the left shoulder
and right hip as it turned out, and he crashed down
behind the door and lay quiet.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The rest of the battle outside had disappeared down
the stairs after the gunmen, but a wounded Mountie
suddenly appeared at the entrance to my room on
hands and knees to help me. He said, “Want a hand,
feller?” and Uhlmann fired through the door at the
voice and . . . and, well, he killed the man. But that
gave me the height of Uhlmann’s gun and I fired
almost as he did, and then I ran out into the centre
of the room to give him some more if need be. But
he didn’t need any more. He was still alive, and when
the remains of the Mounties came back up the stairs,
we took him down and into an ambulance and tried
to get him to talk in hospital. But he wouldn’t—a
mixture of Gestapo and <span class="calibre10">SPECTRE</span> is a good one—and
he died the next morning.’</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond looked me in the eyes, but his own
didn’t see me. He said, ‘We lost two of our side and
another wounded. They lost the German, and one of
theirs, and the other two won’t last long. But the
battlefield was a nasty sight and, well,’ his face looked
suddenly drawn and tired, ‘I’ve seen enough of this
sort of thing. After the various post-mortems were
over I wanted to get away. My headquarters, and the
Mounties backed them up, wanted me to report the
whole case to Washington, to our opposite numbers
there, to get their help in cleaning up the American
end of The Mechanics gang. The Mechanics had been
given a nasty jolt, and the Mounties Special Branch
thought it would be a good idea to follow up while
they were still groggy. I said all right, but that I would
like to drive down and not just dash off in an aeroplane
or train. That was allowed so long as I didn’t take more
than three days and I hired this car and started at dawn
this morning. I was going all right, pretty fast, when I
ran into the hell of a storm, the tail of yours I suppose.
I got through it as far as Lake George and I meant to
stay the night there, but it looked such a hellish place
that when I saw a sign up at a side road advertising
this motel I took a chance.’ He smiled at me, and now
he looked quite cheerful again. ‘Perhaps something
told me you were at the end of the road and that you
were in trouble. Anyway, I had a puncture a mile from
here, and here I am.’ He smiled again, and reached out
and put his hand on mine on the counter. ‘Funny the
way things work out!’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But you must be absolutely beat, driving all that
way.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ve got something for that. Be a good girl and give
me another cup of coffee.’</p>

<p class="pindent">While I busied myself with the percolator, he opened
his case and took out a small bottle of white pills. He
took out two and when I gave him the coffee he swallowed
them down. ‘Benzedrine. That’ll keep me awake
for tonight. I’ll fit in some sleep tomorrow.’ His eyes
went to the mirror. ‘Hullo. Here they come.’ He gave
me a smile of encouragement. ‘Now just don’t worry.
Get some sleep. I’ll be around to see there’s no
trouble.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The music on the radio faded and musical chimes
sounded midnight.</p>
