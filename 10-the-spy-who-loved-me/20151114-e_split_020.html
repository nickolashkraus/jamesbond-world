<p class="pindent">Those were the last words he spoke to me. When I
woke up the next morning he was gone. There was
only the dent down the bed where he had lain, and
the smell of him on the pillow. To make sure, I jumped
out of bed and ran to see if the grey car was still there.
It wasn’t.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a beautiful day and there was heavy dew on
the ground, and in the dew I could see the single track
of his footprints leading to where the car had been.
A bobolink flew crying across the clearing, and from
somewhere in the trees came the dying call of a
mourning dove.</p>

<p class="pindent">The ruins of the motel were black and hideous and
a ghostly wisp of smoke rose straight up into the still
air from the remains of the lobby block. I went back
into the cabin and had a shower and began briskly to
pack my things into my saddle-bags. Then I saw the
letter on the dressing table and I went and sat on the
bed and read it.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was written on motel paper from the writing desk.
The writing was very clear and even and he had used
a real pen and not a ball point.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="line6">Dear Viv,</p>

<p class="pindent">You may have to show this to the police, so I will be
businesslike. I am on my way to Glens Falls where I
will make a full report to the police after telling the
Highway Patrol to get to you immediately. I will also
get in touch with Washington and they will almost
certainly put Albany in charge of the case. I shall
pull every string to see that you are not worried too
much and that they let you go on your way after
getting your statement. Glens Falls will have my
route and the registration number of the car and
they will be able to pick me up wherever I am if you
need any help or they want to know anything more
from me. You won’t be able to get any breakfast so I
shall have the Patrol bring you a Thermos of coffee
and sandwiches to keep you alive. I would much like
to stay with you, if only to see Mr Sanguinetti! But I
very much doubt if he will be turning up this
morning. I guess that when he heard nothing from
his two strong-arm boys he went like hell to Albany
and got on the first plane for the South on his way
out to Mexico. I shall tell Washington that that’s my
guess and they should be able to pick him up if they
get a move on. He should get life for this, or what’s
known as ‘from now on’, or ‘The Rosary’, in the
language we’ve been learning. And now listen. You,
and up to a point me, have saved the insurance
company at least half a million dollars and there’ll be
a big reward. I’m not allowed to accept rewards by
the rules of my job, so there’s no argument about
that, even if it weren’t a fact that it was you who
took the principal burden of all this and it’s you who
are the heroine. So I’m going to make a real issue of
this and see that the insurance company does the
right thing. And something else. I wouldn’t be at all
surprised if one or both of those hoodlums wasn’t
wanted by the police and has a reward on his head.
I’ll see to that too. As for the future, drive very
carefully the rest of the way. And don’t have nightmares.
These sort of things don’t often happen.
Treat it all as just a bad motor accident you were
lucky to get out of. And go on being as wonderful as
you are. If you ever want me or need any help,
wherever you are, you can get me by letter or cable,
but not by telephone, c/o Ministry of Defence,
Storey’s Gate, London, SW1.</p>

<p class="line7">Ever,</p>
<p class="line8">J.B.</p>

<p class="line6">PS. Your tyre pressures are too high for the South.
Remember to take them down.</p>

<p class="line6">PPS. Try Guerlain’s ‘Fleurs des Alpes’ instead of
Camay!</p>

</div>

<p class="pindent">I heard the roar of motor-cycles coming up the
road. When they stopped, there was the brief wail of
a siren to announce who they were. I put the letter
inside the top of my overalls and pulled up the zip
and went out to meet The Law.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">They were two State Troopers, smart and young and
very nice. I’d almost forgotten such people existed.
They saluted me as if I was royalty. ‘Miss Vivienne
Michel?’ The senior, a lieutenant, did the talking while
his Number Two muttered quietly into his radio
announcing their arrival.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m Lieutenant Morrow. We hear you had some
trouble last night.’ He gestured with his gloved hand
at the ruins. ‘Seems like we heard right.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, that’s nothing,’ I said disdainfully. ‘There’s a car
in the lake with a corpse in it and another corpse
behind cabin Number 3.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, miss.’ There was a hint of disapproval at my
levity. He turned to his companion, who had clipped
back the microphone to the set behind his saddle.
‘O’Donnell, take a look round, would you?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Okay, loot.’ O’Donnell strode off across the grass.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, let’s go and take a seat somewhere, Miss
Michel.’ The lieutenant bent down to one of his saddle-bags
and produced a carefully wrapped package.
‘Brought along some breakfast. ’Fraid it’s only coffee
and doughnuts. That suit you?’ He held out the
package.</p>

<p class="pindent">I gave him a full candlepower smile. ‘That’s terribly
kind of you. I’m starving. There are some seats over
by the lake. We can choose one that’s out of sight of
the sunk car.’ I led the way across the grass and we
sat down. The lieutenant took off his cap and produced
a notebook and pencil and pretended to go through
his notes to give me a chance to get started on a
doughnut.</p>

<p class="pindent">He looked up and produced his first smile. ‘Now
don’t worry about this, miss. I’m not taking a statement.
The captain’s coming up himself for that. Should
be along any time now. When they gave me the hurry
call I got down the bare facts. But what’s worrying me
is that that radio just hasn’t left me alone since then.
Had to cut down my speed the whole way here from
Route 9 to keep on listening to instructions from the
station—that Albany was interested in the case, that
even the top brass in Washington was breathing down
our necks. Never heard such a load coming over the
air. Now, miss, can you tell me how it’s come about
that Washington’s mixed up in this, and within a bare
couple of hours of Glens Falls getting the first
report?’</p>

<p class="pindent">I couldn’t help smiling at his earnestness. I could
almost hear him calling over to O’Donnell as they
roared along, ‘Hell, we’ll have Jack Kennedy on our
tails any moment now!’ I said, ‘Well, there’s a man
called James Bond who’s involved. He saved me and
shot these two gangsters. He’s some kind of an English
agent, secret service or something. He was driving
from Toronto to Washington to report on a case, and
he got a flat and ended up at the motel. If he hadn’t,
I’d be dead by now. Anyway, I guess he must be
someone pretty important. He told me he wanted to
make sure this Mr Sanguinetti didn’t get away to Mexico
or somewhere. But that’s more or less all I know about
him, except that—except that he seemed a wonderful
guy.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The lieutenant looked sympathetic. ‘Guess so, miss.
If he got you out of this trouble. But he’s certainly
got a fix in with the FBI. They don’t often tangle in
a local case like this. Unless they’re called in, that is,
or there’s some Federal angle.’ The thin wail of sirens
sounded far down the road. Lieutenant Morrow got
to his feet and put his cap on. ‘Well thanks, miss. I
was just satisfying my curiosity. The captain will be
taking over from here. Don’t you worry. He’s a nice
kind of a guy.’ O’Donnell came up. ‘If you’ll excuse
me, miss.’ The lieutenant moved off with O’Donnell,
listening to his report, and I finished the coffee and
followed slowly, thinking of the grey Thunderbird that
would now be hammering out the miles southward
and of the sunburned hands on the wheel.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">It was quite a cavalcade that came sweeping up the
road between the pines—a squad car with outriders,
an ambulance, two other police cars and a recovery
truck that came towards me across the grass and went
on down to the lake. Everyone seemed to have had
their orders, and very soon the whole area was covered
with moving figures in olive green or dark blue.</p>

<p class="pindent">The heavily built man who soon came forward to
meet me, followed by a junior officer who turned
out to be the stenographer, looked every inch the
detective-captain of the films—slow-moving, kindly
faced, purposeful. He held out his hand. ‘Miss Michel?
I’m Captain Stonor from Glens Falls. Let’s go somewhere
where we can have a talk, shall we? One of
the cabins, or shall we stay out in the open?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ve had about enough of the cabins, if you don’t
mind. Why not over there—my breakfast table. And
by the way, thank you very much for your thoughtfulness.
I was starving.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t thank me, Miss Michel,’ the captain’s eyes
twinkled frostily. ‘It was your English friend,
Commander Bond, who suggested it,’ he paused,
‘among other things.’</p>

<p class="pindent">So he was a commander. It was the only rank I liked
the name of. And of course he was bound to have
put the captain’s back up—an Englishman with all this
authority. And with the CIA and FBI of all people!
Nothing would irritate the regular police more. I
decided to be extremely diplomatic.</p>

<p class="pindent">We sat down and, after the usual police preliminaries,
I was asked to tell my story.</p>

<p class="pindent">It took two hours, what with Captain Stonor’s questions
and men coming up from time to time to whisper
hoarsely into his ear, and at the end of it I was
exhausted. Coffee was brought and cigarettes for me
(‘Not while I’m on duty, thank you, Miss Michel’), and
then we all relaxed and the stenographer was sent away.
Captain Stonor sent for Lieutenant Morrow and took
him aside to radio a preliminary report to headquarters,
and I watched the wreck of the black sedan, that had
by now been hauled up the cliff, being towed over the
lawn to the road. There the ambulance was driven over
beside it, and I turned away as a wet bundle was carefully
lifted out on to the grass. Horror! I remembered
again those cold, red-flecked eyes. I felt his hands on
me. Could it have happened?</p>

<p class="pindent">I heard the captain say, ‘And copies to Albany and
Washington. Right?’ And then he was back sitting
opposite me.</p>

<p class="pindent">He looked at me kindly and said some complimentary
things. I looked appreciative and said, ‘No, no.’ I
asked when he thought I could get on.</p>

<p class="pindent">Captain Stonor didn’t answer immediately. Instead
he slowly reached up and took off his cap and put it
on the table. The armistice gesture, a copy of the
lieutenant’s, made me smile inside. Then he rummaged
in his pockets and took out cigarettes and a lighter.
He offered me one and then lit his own. He smiled at
me, his first non-official smile. ‘I’m going off duty now,
Miss Michel.’ He sat back comfortably and crossed his
legs, resting his left ankle on his right knee and holding
the ankle. He suddenly looked like a middle-aged man
with a family, taking it easy. He took his first long draw
on his cigarette and watched the smoke drift away. He
said, ‘You can be going any time now, Miss Michel.
Your friend Commander Bond was anxious that you
should be put to as little trouble as possible. And I’m
glad to accommodate him—and you. And,’ he smiled
with unexpected humour and irony, ‘I didn’t need
Washington to add their wishes in this matter. You’ve
been a brave girl. You got involved in a bad crime and
you behaved like I’d wish any child of mine to behave.
Those two hoodlums are both wanted men. I’ll be
putting in your name for the rewards. Likewise to the
insurance company, who will certainly be generous.
We’ve booked those Phanceys on a preliminary charge
of conspiracy to defraud, and this Mr Sanguinetti is
already on the run, as the Commander suggested this
morning he would be. We checked with Troy, as we
would have checked anyway, and the normal police
machinery is in motion to pick him up. There will be
a capital charge against Mr Sanguinetti, if and when
we catch up with him, and it may be that you will be
needed as a material witness. The State will pay for
you to be brought from wherever you may be, housed
and taken back again. All this,’ Captain Stonor made
a throwaway gesture with his cigarette, ‘is normal police
routine and it will look after itself.’ The astute blue
eyes looked carefully into mine and then veiled themselves.
‘But that doesn’t quite end the case to my
satisfaction.’ He smiled. ‘That is, now that I’m off duty,
so to speak, and there’s only just you and me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I tried to look just interested and nonchalant, but I
wondered what was coming.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Did this Commander Bond leave you any instructions,
any letter? He told me that he had left you asleep
early this morning. That he had gone off around six
and had not wanted to wake you up. Quite right of
course. But,’ Captain Stonor examined the end of his
cigarette, ‘your evidence and the Commander’s is to
the effect that you shared the same cabin. Quite natural
in the circumstances. You wouldn’t have wanted to be
alone any more last night. But it seems rather an abrupt
goodbye—after an exciting night like that. No trouble
with him, I suppose? He didn’t, er, try to get fresh
with you, if you get my meaning?’ The eyes were
apologetic, but they probed into mine.</p>

<p class="pindent">I blushed furiously. I said sharply, ‘Certainly not,
Captain. Yes, he did leave a letter for me. A perfectly
straightforward one. I didn’t mention it because it
doesn’t add anything to what you know.’ I ran down
the zip on my front and reached inside for the letter,
blushing even worse. Damn the man!</p>

<p class="pindent">He took the letter and read it carefully. He handed
it back. ‘A very nice letter. Very, er, businesslike. I don’t
get the bit about the soap.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I said shortly, ‘Oh, that was only a joke about the
motel soap. He said it was too strongly scented.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I see. Yes, sure. Well, that’s fine, Miss Michel’ The
eyes were kindly again. ‘Well, now. D’you mind if I
say something personal? Talk to you a minute as if
you might be my own daughter? You could be, you
know—almost my granddaughter if I’d started early
enough.’ He chuckled cosily.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No. Please say anything you like.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Captain Stonor took another cigarette and lit it. ‘Well,
now, Miss Michel, what the Commander says is right.
You’ve been in the equivalent of a bad motor accident
and you don’t want to have any nightmares about it.
But there’s more to it than that. You’ve been suddenly
introduced, out of the blue so to speak, and violently,
to the underground war of crime, the war that’s going
on all the time and that you read about and see in
movies. And, like in the movies, the cop has rescued
the maiden from the robbers.’ He leaned forward across
the table and held my eyes firmly in his. ‘Now don’t get
me wrong about this, Miss Michel, and if I’m speaking
out of turn just forget what I’m going to say. But it
would be unreasonable of you not to create a hero out
of the cop who saved you, perhaps build an image in
your mind that that’s the sort of man to look up to,
even perhaps to want to marry.’ The captain sat back.
He smiled apologetically. ‘Now the reason I’m going
into all this is because violent emergencies like what
you’ve been through leave their scars. They’re one hell
of a shock to anyone—to any dam’ citizen. But most
of all to a young person like yourself. Now I believe,’
(the kind eyes became less kind) ‘I have good reason
from the reports of my officers to believe, that you had
intimate relations with Commander Bond last night. I’m
afraid it’s one of our less attractive duties to be able to
read such signs.’ Captain Stonor held up his hand. ‘Now
I’m not prying any more into these private things, and
they’re none of my business, but it would be perfectly
natural, almost inevitable, that you might have lost your
heart, or at any rate part of it, to this personable young
Englishman who has just saved your life.’ The sympathy
in the fatherly smile was edged with irony. ‘After all’s
said and done, that’s what happens in the books and in
the movies, isn’t it? So why not in real life?’</p>

<p class="pindent">I stirred impatiently, wanting this stupid lecture to
finish, wanting to be gone.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now I’m coming to the end very quickly, Miss
Michel, and I know you think I’m being very impertinent,
but ever since I got past middle-age on the
force, I’ve been interested in what I call post-natal care
after a case like this. Particularly when the survivor is
young and might be damaged by what the young person
has been through. So I want to leave one thought with
you if I may, and then wish you the best of luck and
a happy journey on that crazy little scooter-thing of
yours. It’s just this, Miss Michel.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Captain Stonor’s eyes continued to look into mine,
but they had lost focus. I knew I was going to hear
something from the heart. This is a rare thing between
generations—between grown-ups and children. I
stopped thinking of getting away and paid attention.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘This underground war I was talking about, this
crime battle that’s always going on—whether it’s being
fought between cops and robbers or between spies
and counter-spies. This is a private battle between two
trained armies, one fighting on the side of law and of
what his own country thinks is right, and one belonging
to the enemies of these things.’ Captain Stonor was
now talking to himself. I imagined that he was reciting
something—something he felt very strongly about—perhaps
had said in speeches or in an article in some
police magazine. ‘But in the higher ranks of these
forces, among the toughest of the professionals, there’s
a deadly quality in the persons involved which is
common to both—to both friends and enemies.’ The
captain’s closed fist came softly down on the wooden
table-top for emphasis, and his inward-looking eyes
burned with a dedicated, private anger. ‘The top gangsters,
the top FBI operatives, the top spies and the top
counter-spies are cold-hearted, cold-blooded, ruthless,
tough, killers, Miss Michel. Yes, even the “friends” as
opposed to the “enemies”. They have to be. They
wouldn’t survive if they weren’t. Do you get me?’
Captain Stonor’s eyes came back into focus. Now they
held mine with a friendly urgency that touched my
feelings—but not, I’m ashamed to say, my heart. ‘So
the message I want to leave with you, my dear—and
I’ve talked with Washington and I’ve learned something
about Commander Bond’s outstanding record in his
particular line of business—is this. Keep away from
<span class="it">all</span> these men. They are not for you, whether they’re
called James Bond or Sluggsy Morant. Both these men,
and others like them, belong to a private jungle into
which you’ve strayed for a few hours and from which
you’ve escaped. So don’t go and get sweet dreams
about the one or nightmares from the other. They’re
just different people from the likes of you—a different
species.’ Captain Stonor smiled, ‘Like hawks and doves,
if you’ll pardon the comparison. Get me?’ My expression
cannot have been receptive. The voice became
abrupt. ‘Okay, let’s go then.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Captain Stonor got to his feet and I followed. I
didn’t know what to say. I remembered my immediate
reaction when James Bond had shown himself at the
door of the motel—‘Oh, God, it’s another of them.’
But I also remembered his smile and his kisses and
his arm round me. I walked meekly beside this large,
comfortable man who had come out with these kindly
meant thoughts, and all I could think was that I wanted
a big lunch and then a long sleep at least a hundred
miles from The Dreamy Pines Motor Court.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">It was twelve noon by the time I got away. Captain
Stonor said I was going to have a lot of trouble from
the press, but that he would stave them off for as long
as possible. I could say all I wished about James Bond
except what his profession was and where he could
be found. He was just a man who had turned up at
the right time and then gone on his way.</p>

<p class="pindent">I had packed my saddle-bags and the young State
Trooper, Lieutenant Morrow, strapped them on for
me and wheeled the Vespa out on to the road. On the
way over the lawn he said, ‘Mind out for the potholes
between here and Glens Falls, miss. Some of them are
so deep you better sound your horn before you get to
them. There might be other folks with little machines
like this at the bottom of them.’ I laughed. He was
clean and gay and young, but tough and adventurous
as well by the looks of him and from his job. Perhaps
this was more the type of man I should build dreams
about!</p>

<p class="pindent">I said goodbye to Captain Stonor and thanked him.
Then, rather frightened of making a fool of myself, I
put on my crash helmet and pulled down my saucy,
fur-lined goggles, got on the machine and stamped on
the starter pedal. Thank heavens the little engine fired
right away! Now I would show them! By design, the
rear wheel was still on its stand. I let in the clutch fairly
fast and gave a quick push. The spinning rear wheel
made contact with the loose surface of the road, and
dust and pebbles flew. And I was gone like a rocket
and, in ten seconds through the gears, I was doing
forty. The surface looked all right ahead so I took a
chance and glanced back and raised a cheeky hand in
farewell, and there was a wave from the little group
of police in front of the smoking lobby block. And
then I was off down the long straight road between
the two sentinel rows of pine trees and I thought the
trees looked sorry to be letting me get away
unharmed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Unharmed? What was it the captain of detectives
had said about ‘scars’? I just didn’t believe him. The
scars of my terror had been healed, wiped away, by
this stranger who slept with a gun under his pillow,
this secret agent who was only known by a number.</p>

<p class="pindent">A secret agent? I didn’t care what he did. A number?
I had already forgotten it. I knew exactly who he was
and what he was. And everything, every smallest detail,
would be written on my heart for ever.</p>
