<p class="pindent">Cabin Number 3 was airless and stuffy. While James
Bond collected our ‘luggage’ from among the trees, I
opened the glass slats of the windows and turned down
the sheets on the double bed. I should have felt embarrassed,
but I didn’t. I just enjoyed housekeeping for him
by moonlight. Then I tried the shower and found miraculously
that there was still full pressure, though further
down the line many stretches of the pipes must have
melted. The top cabins were nearer to the main. I stripped
off all my clothes and made them into a neat pile and
went into the shower and opened a new cake of Camay
(‘Pamper your Guests with Pink Camay—With a scent
like costly French Perfume . . . blended with Fine Cold
Cream’ I remembered, because it sounded so succulent,
it said on the packet) and began to lather myself all over,
gently, because of the bruises.</p>

<p class="pindent">Through the noise of the shower, I didn’t hear him
come into the bathroom. But suddenly there were two
more hands washing me and a naked body was up
against mine and I smelled the sweat and the gunpowder
and I turned and laughed up into his grimy face and
then I was in his arms and our mouths met in a kiss
that seemed as if it would never end while the water
poured down and made us shut our eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">When my breath was almost exhausted, he pulled
me out from under the shower and we kissed again,
more slowly, while his hands wandered over my body
and desire came in waves of dizziness. I simply couldn’t
stand it. I said, ‘Please, James! Please don’t! Or I shall
fall down. And be gentle. You’re hurting me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">In the moonlit dusk of the bathroom, his eyes were
only fierce slits. Now they relaxed into tenderness and
laughter. ‘I’m sorry, Viv. It’s not my fault. It’s my hands.
They won’t stay away from you. And they ought to be
washing <span class="it">me</span>. I’m filthy. You’ll have to do it. They won’t
obey me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I laughed up at him, and pulled him under the
shower. ‘All right then. But I shan’t be gentle. The last
time I washed anyone it was a pony when I was about
twelve! Anyway, I can hardly see which bit of you’s
which!’ I got hold of the soap. ‘Put your face down.
I’ll try not to put too much in your eyes.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If you put any in, I’ll . . .’ My hands stopped the
rest of the sentence and I set about scrubbing his face
and hair and then moved on down his arms and chest,
while he stood bowed and holding with both hands
to the water pipe.</p>

<p class="pindent">I stopped. ‘You’ll have to do the rest.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Certainly not. And do it properly. You never know.
There might be a world war and you’d have to be a
nurse. You might as well learn how to wash a man.
And anyway, what the hell’s this soap? I smell like
Cleopatra.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s very good. It’s got costly French perfume in it.
It says so on the packet. And you smell delicious. Much
better than your gunpowder smell.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He laughed. ‘Well, get on. But hurry.’</p>

<p class="pindent">So I bent down and began and of course in a minute
we were in each other’s arms again under the shower
and our bodies were slithery with water and soap and
he turned the shower off and lifted me out of the
shower cabinet and began to dry me lingeringly with
the bath towel while I leant back within his free arm
and just let it happen. Then I took the towel and dried
him, and then it was silly to wait any longer and he
picked me up in his arms and carried me through into
the bedroom and laid me down on the bed and I
watched through half-closed lashes his pale shape as
he went round drawing the curtains and locking up.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then he was lying beside me.</p>

<p class="pindent">His hands and his mouth were slow and electric and
his body in my arms was tenderly fierce.</p>

<p class="pindent">Afterwards he told me that when the moment came
I screamed. I didn’t know I had. I only know that a
chasm of piercing sweetness suddenly opened and
drowned me and that I dug my nails into his hips to
make sure of taking him with me. Then he sleepily
said some sweet things and kissed me once and his
body slithered away and lay still and I stayed on my
back and gazed up into the red darkness and listened
to his breathing.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">I had never before made love, full love, with my heart
as well as my body. It had been sweet with Derek, cold
and satisfying with Kurt. But this was something
different. At last I realized what this thing could be in
one’s life.</p>

<p class="pindent">I think I know why I gave myself so completely to
this man, how I was capable of it with someone I had
met only six hours before. Apart from the excitement
of his looks, his authority, his maleness, he had come
from nowhere, like the prince in the fairy tales, and
he had saved me from the dragon. But for him, I
would now be dead, after suffering God knows what
before. He could have changed the wheel on his car
and gone off, or, when danger came, he could have
saved his own skin. But he had fought for my life as
if it had been his own. And then, when the dragon
was dead, he had taken me as his reward. In a few
hours, I knew, he would be gone—without protestations
of love, without apologies or excuses. And that
would be the end of that—gone, finished.</p>

<p class="pindent">All women love semi-rape. They love to be taken. It
was his sweet brutality against my bruised body that
had made his act of love so piercingly wonderful. That
and the coinciding of nerves completely relaxed after
the removal of tension and danger, the warmth of
gratitude, and a woman’s natural feeling for her hero. I
had no regrets and no shame. There might be many
consequences for me—not the least that I might now
be dissatisfied with other men. But whatever my troubles
were, he would never hear of them. I would not pursue
him and try to repeat what there had been between us.
I would stay away from him and leave him to go his
own road where there would be other women, countless
other women, who would probably give him as much
physical pleasure as he had had with me. I wouldn’t care,
or at least I told myself that I wouldn’t care, because
none of them would ever own him—own any larger
piece of him than I now did. And for all my life I would
be grateful to him, for everything. And I would remember
him for ever as my image of a man.</p>

<p class="pindent">How silly could one be? What was there to dramatize
about this naked male person lying beside me? He
was just a professional agent who had done his job.
He was trained to fire guns, to kill people. What was
so wonderful about that? Brave, strong, ruthless with
women—these were the qualities that went with his
calling—what he was paid to be. He was only some
kind of a spy, a spy who had loved me. Not even
loved, slept with. Why should I make him my hero,
swear never to forget him? I suddenly had an impulse
to wake him up and ask him: ‘Can you be nice? Can
you be kind?’</p>

<p class="pindent">I turned over on my side. He was asleep, breathing
quietly, his head resting on his outflung forearm, his
right arm tucked under the pillow. Again the moon
outside was bright. Red light filtered through the
curtains, mixing the black shadows of his body with
shining crimson highlights. I bent closely over him,
breathing in his maleness, longing to touch him, to
run my hand down his sunburned back to where the
brown became abruptly white where his summer
bathing-trunks had been.</p>

<p class="pindent">After looking long at him, I lay back. No, he was as
I had thought him to be. Yes, this was a man to
love.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">The red curtains at the other end of the room were
moving. Through half-sleeping eyes I wondered why.
Outside, the wind had dropped and there was no
sound. Lazily I raised my eyes to look above me. The
curtains at this end of the room, above our bed, were
motionless. There must be a small breeze coming off
the lake. Come on! For heaven’s sake go to sleep!</p>

<p class="pindent">And then, with a sudden ripping noise high up on
the opposite wall, the bits of curtains hung sideways.
And a big, glittering turnip-face, pale and shiny under
the moon, was looking through the glass slats!</p>

<p class="pindent">I never knew that hair could stand up on end. I
thought it was invented by writers. But I heard a
scratching on the pillow round my ears and I felt the
fresh night air on my scalp. ‘I wanted to scream, but
I couldn’t.’ ‘My limbs were frozen.’ ‘I couldn’t move
hand or foot.’ I thought these too were fictions. They
aren’t. I simply lay and stared, noting my physical
sensations—even to the symptom that my eyes were
so wide open that they ached. But I couldn’t move a
finger. I was—another phrase from books—frightened
stiff, stiff as a board.</p>

<p class="pindent">The face behind the glass window slats was grinning.
Perhaps the teeth were bared, like an animal’s, with
effort. The moon glistened off the teeth and off the
eyes and off the top of the hairless head to make a
kind of child’s sketch of a face.</p>

<p class="pindent">The ghost face jerked slowly round the room,
looking. It saw the white bed with the twin smudges
of the heads on the pillow. It stopped looking and
slowly, painfully, a hand, with shiny metal in it, came
up beside the head and smashed clumsily downwards
through the panes of glass.</p>

<p class="pindent">The noise was a trigger that released me. I screamed
and hit sideways with my hand. It probably didn’t help.
The crash of glass had wakened him. I might even
have spoiled his aim. But then came the double roar
of guns, the solid slap of bullets into the wall above
my head, another great splintering of glass and the
turnip face had gone.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Are you all right, Viv?’ His voice was urgent,
desperate.</p>

<p class="pindent">He saw that I was and didn’t wait for an answer.
The bed heaved and suddenly the moonlight threw a
great block of light through the door. He ran so quietly
that I didn’t hear his feet on the concrete floor of the
car-port, but I could visualize him flattening himself
against its wall and edging round. I just lay and stared
aghast—another literary word, but an accurate one—at
the jagged remains of the window and remembered
the glistening, horrible turnip head that must
have been a ghost.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond came back. He didn’t say a word. The
first thing he did was to get me a glass of water. The
prosaic action, the first thing a parent does when the
child has nightmares, brought back the room and its
familiar shapes from the black and red cave of the
ghosts and the guns. Then he fetched a bath towel and
put a chair under the smashed window and climbed
on it and draped the towel over the window.</p>

<p class="pindent">I was suddenly conscious of the muscles that
bunched and relaxed in his naked body and I was
amused at how odd a man looks without any clothes
on when he is not making love but just moving about
a room doing a kind of household chores. I thought
that perhaps one ought to be a nudist. But perhaps
only under forty. I said, ‘James, don’t ever get fat.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He had fixed the towel as a curtain. He got down
off the chair and said absent-mindedly, ‘No. That’s
right. One shouldn’t get fat.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He put the chair tidily back beside the desk where
it belonged and picked up his gun that he had put
down on the desk. He examined the gun. He went to
his small pile of clothes and took out a new clip and
substituted it for the old one and came over to the
bed and slipped the gun under his pillow.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now I realized why he had lain like that, with his
right hand doubled under the pillow. I guessed that he
always slept like that. I thought his must be rather like
a fireman’s life, always waiting for a call. I thought
how extraordinary it must be to have danger as your
business.</p>

<p class="pindent">He came and sat down on the edge of my side of
the bed. In the filtering scraps of light his face looked
drawn and sort of blasted, as if by shock. He tried to
smile, but the tense muscles wouldn’t let him and it
was only a crooked sketch of a smile. He said, ‘I nearly
got us both killed again. I’m sorry, Viv. I must be losing
my touch. If I go on like this I’m going to catch
trouble. When the car went into the lake, remember a
bit of the roof and the rear window was left sticking
out of the water? Well, there was obviously plenty of
air trapped in that corner. I was a damned fool not to
have worked that out for myself. This fellow Sluggsy
only needed to knock out the rear window and swim
ashore. He was hit several times. It must have been
hard going for him. But he got to our cabin. We ought
to be dead ducks. Don’t go round the back in the
morning. He’s not a pretty sight.’ He looked at me for
reassurance. ‘Anyway, I’m sorry, Viv. It ought never to
have happened.’</p>

<p class="pindent">I scrambled off the bed and went and put my arms
round him. His body was cold. I hugged him to me
and kissed him. ‘Don’t be silly, James! If it wasn’t for
me, you wouldn’t have got into all this mess. And
where would I be now if it wasn’t for you? I’d not
only have been a dead duck, but a roasted one too,
hours ago. The trouble with you is you haven’t had
enough sleep. And you’re cold. Come into bed with
me. I’ll keep you warm.’ I got up and pulled him to
his feet.</p>

<p class="pindent">He caught me to him. He reached down with both
hands and pressed my body hard into his. He held me
like that for a time, quite still, and I felt the way his
body was gaining warmth from mine. Then he lifted
me up and laid me softly back on the bed. And then
he took me fiercely, almost cruelly, and once again
there came the small scream from someone who was
no longer me and then we were lying side by side and
his heart was pounding wildly against my breast and
I found that my right hand was clenched in his hair.</p>

<p class="pindent">I relaxed my cramped fingers and reached down for
his hand. I said, ‘James, what’s a bimbo?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Why?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ll tell you when you’ve told me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He laughed sleepily. ‘It’s gangster language for a
whore.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I thought it was something like that. They kept on
calling me that. I suppose it must really be true.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You don’t qualify.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Promise you don’t think I’m a bimbo?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Promise. You’re just a darling chick. I’m cow-simple
about you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What’s that mean?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It means crazy for a girl. Now, that’s enough questions.
Go to sleep.’ He kissed me gently, and turned
over on his side.</p>

<p class="pindent">I curled up against him, fitting myself close in to
his back and thighs. ‘This is a nice way to sleep—like
spoons. Goodnight, James.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Goodnight, darling Viv.’</p>
