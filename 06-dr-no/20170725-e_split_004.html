<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="sc">t would be</span> around eight o’clock, Bond thought. Apart
from the background tinkle of the frogs it was very quiet. In
the far corner of the clearing he could see the dark outline of
Quarrel. There was the soft clink of metal as he dismantled and
dried the Remington.</p>

<p class="pindent">Through the bushes the distant yellow lights from the
guanera made festive pathways across the dark surface of the
lake. The ugly wind had gone and the hideous scenery lay
drowned in darkness. It was cool. Bond’s clothes had dried on
him. The three big handfuls of food had warmed his stomach.
He felt comfortable and drowsy and at peace. Tomorrow was
a long way off and presented no problems except a great deal
of physical exercise. Life suddenly felt easy and good.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl lay beside him in the sleeping-bag. She was lying
on her back with her head cradled in her hands, looking up at
the roof of stars. He could just make out the pale pool of her
face. She said, “James. You promised to tell me what this is
all about. Come on. I shan’t go to sleep until you do.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. “I’ll tell if you’ll tell. I want to know what
you’re all about.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I don’t mind. I’ve got no secrets. But you first.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“All right then.” Bond pulled his knees up to his chin and
put his arms round them. “It’s like this. I’m a sort of policeman.
They send me out from London when there’s something
odd going on somewhere in the world that isn’t anybody else’s
business. Well, not long ago one of the Governor’s staff in
Kingston, a man called Strangways, friend of mine, disappeared.
His secretary, who was a pretty girl, did too. Most people
thought they’d run away together. I didn’t. I . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond told the story in simple terms, with good men and bad
men, like an adventure story out of a book. He ended, “So you
see, Honey, it’s just a question of getting back to Jamaica
tomorrow night, all three of us in the canoe, and then the
Governor will listen to us and send over a lot of soldiers to get
this Chinaman to own up. I expect that’ll mean he’ll go to
prison. He’ll know that too and that’s why he’s trying to stop
us. That’s all. Now it’s your turn.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl said, “You seem to live a very exciting life. Your
wife can’t like you being away so much. Doesn’t she worry
about you getting hurt?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m not married. The only people who worry about me
getting hurt are my insurance company.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She probed, “But I suppose you have girls.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Not permanent ones.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a pause. Quarrel came over to them. “Cap’n,
Ah’ll take de fust watch if dat suits. Be out on de point of de
sandspit. Ah’ll come call yo around midnight. Den mebbe
yo take on till five and den we all git goin’. Need to get well
away from dis place afore it’s light.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Suits me,” said Bond. “Wake me if you see anything. Gun
all right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Him’s jess fine,” said Quarrel happily. He said, “Sleep
well, missy,” with a hint of meaning, and melted noiselessly
away into the shadows.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I like Quarrel,” said the girl. She paused, then, “Do you
really want to know about me? It’s not as exciting as your
story.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course I do. And don’t leave anything out.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“There’s nothing to leave out. You could get my whole life
on to the back of a postcard. To begin with I’ve never been out
of Jamaica. I’ve lived all my life at a place called Beau Desert
on the North Coast near Morgan’s Harbour.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. “That’s odd. So do I. At least for the
moment. I didn’t notice you about. Do you live up a tree?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, I suppose you’ve taken the beach house. I never go
near the place. I live in the Great House.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“But there’s nothing left of it. It’s a ruin in the middle of the
cane fields.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I live in the cellars. I’ve lived there since I was five. It was
burned down then and my parents were killed. I can’t remember
anything about them so you needn’t say you’re sorry.
At first I lived there with my black nanny. She died when I
was fifteen. For the last five years I’ve lived there alone.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Good heavens.” Bond was appalled. “But wasn’t there
anyone else to look after you? Didn’t your parents leave any
money?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Not a penny.” There was no bitterness in the girl’s voice—pride
if anything. “You see the Riders were one of the old
Jamaican families. The first one had been given the Beau
Desert lands by Cromwell for having been one of the people
who signed King Charles’s death warrant. He built the Great
House and my family lived in it on and off ever since. But then
sugar collapsed and I suppose the place was badly run, and
by the time my father inherited it there was nothing but debts—mortgages
and things like that. So when my father and
mother died the property was sold up. I didn’t mind. I was
too young. Nanny must have been wonderful. They wanted
people to adopt me, the clergyman and the legal people did,
but Nanny collected the sticks of furniture that hadn’t been
burned and we settled down in the ruins and after a bit no one
came and interfered with us. She did a bit of sewing and
laundry in the village and grew a few plantains and bananas
and things and there was a big breadfruit tree up against the
old house. We ate what the Jamaicans eat. And there was the
sugar cane all round us and she made a fishpot which we used
to go and take up every day. It was all right. We had enough to
eat. Somehow she taught me to read and write. There was a
pile of old books left from the fire. There was an encyclopedia.
I started with A when I was about eight. I’ve got as far as the
middle of T.” She said defensively. “I bet I know more than
you do about a lot of things.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I bet you do.” Bond was lost in the picture of the little
flaxen-haired girl pattering about the ruins with the obstinate
old Negress watching over her and calling her in to do the
lessons that must have been just as much a riddle to the old
woman. “Your nanny must have been a wonderful person.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“She was a darling.” It was a flat statement. “I thought I’d
die when she did. It wasn’t such fun after that. Before, I’d led
a child’s life; then I suddenly had to grow up and do everything
for myself. And men tried to catch me and hurt me. They
said they wanted to make love to me.” She paused. “I used to
be pretty then.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said seriously, “You’re one of the most beautiful girls
I’ve ever seen.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“With this nose? Don’t be silly.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You don’t understand.” Bond tried to find words that she
would believe. “Of course anyone can see your nose is broken.
But since this morning I’ve hardly noticed it. When you look
at a person you look into their eyes or at their mouth. That’s
where the expressions are. A broken nose isn’t any more
significant than a crooked ear. Noses and ears are bits of face-furniture.
Some are prettier than others, but they’re not nearly
as important as the rest. They’re part of the background of the
face. If you had a beautiful nose as well as the rest of you
you’d be the most beautiful girl in Jamaica.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Do you mean that?” her voice was urgent. “Do you think
I could be beautiful? I know some of me’s all right, but when
I look in the glass I hardly see anything except my broken
nose. I’m sure it’s like that with other people who are, who are—well—sort
of deformed.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said impatiently, “You’re not deformed! Don’t talk
such nonsense. And anyway you can have it put right by a
simple operation. You’ve only got to get over to America and
it would be done in a week.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She said angrily, “How do you expect me to do that? I’ve
got about fifteen pounds under a stone in my cellar. I’ve got
three skirts and three shirts and a knife and a fishpot. I know
all about these operations. The doctor at Port Maria found out
for me. He’s a nice man. He wrote to America. Do you know,
to have it properly done it would cost me about five hundred
pounds, what with the fare to New York and the hospital and
everything?” Her voice became hopeless. “How do you expect
me to find that amount of money?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had already made up his mind what would have to be
done about that. Now he merely said tenderly, “Well, I expect
there are ways. But anyway, go on with your story. It’s very
exciting—far more interesting than mine. You’d got to where
your Nanny died. What happened then?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl began again reluctantly.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, it’s your fault for interrupting. And you mustn’t talk
about things you don’t understand. I suppose people tell you
you’re good-looking. I expect you get all the girls you want.
Well you wouldn’t if you had a squint or a hare-lip or something.
As a matter of fact,” he could hear the smile in her
voice, “I think I shall go to the obeahman when we get back
and get him to put a spell on you and give you something like
that.” She added lamely, “Then we should be more alike.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond reached out. His hand brushed against her. “I’ve got
other plans,” he said. “But come on. I want to hear the rest of
the story.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh well,” the girl sighed, “I’ll have to go back a bit. You
see all the property is in cane and the old house stands in the
middle of it. Well, about twice a year they cut the cane and
send it off to the mill. And when they do that all the animals
and insects and so on that live in the cane fields go into a panic
and most of them have their houses destroyed and get killed.
At cutting time some of them took to coming to the ruins of
the house and hiding. My Nanny was terrified of them to
begin with, the mongooses and the snakes and the scorpions
and so on, but I made a couple of the cellar rooms into sort of
homes for them. I wasn’t frightened of them and they never
hurt me. They seemed to understand that I was looking after
them. They must have told their friends or something because
after a bit it was quite natural for them all to come trooping
into their rooms and settling down there until the young cane
had started to grow again. Then they all filed out and went back
to living in the fields. I gave them what food we could spare
when they were staying with us and they behaved very well
except for making a bit of a smell and sometimes fighting
amongst each other. But they all got quite tame with me, and
their children did, too, and I could do anything with them.
Of course the cane-cutters found out about this and saw me
walking about with snakes round my neck and so forth, and
they got frightened of me and thought I was obeah. So they
left us absolutely alone.” She paused. “That’s where I found
out so much about animals and insects. I used to spend a lot of
time in the sea finding out about those people too. It was the
same with birds. If you find out what all these people like to
eat and what they’re afraid of, and if you spend all your time
with them you can make friends.” She looked up at him.
“You miss a lot not knowing about these things.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m afraid I do,” said Bond truthfully. “I expect they’re
much nicer and more interesting than humans.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I don’t know about that,” said the girl thoughtfully. “I
don’t know many human people. Most of the ones I have met
have been hateful. But I suppose they can be interesting too.”
She paused. “I hadn’t ever really thought of liking them like I
like the animals. Except for Nanny, of course. Until . . .” She
broke off with a shy laugh. “Well, anyway we all lived happily
together until I was fifteen and Nanny died and then things
got difficult. There was a man called Mander. A horrible man.
He was the white overseer for the people who own the property.
He kept coming to see me. He wanted me to move up to his
house near Port Maria. I hated him and I used to hide when
I heard his horse coming through the cane. One night he came
on foot and I didn’t hear him. He was drunk. He came into
the cellar and fought with me because I wouldn’t do what he
wanted me to do. You know, the things people in love do.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, I know.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I tried to kill him with my knife, but he was very strong
and he hit me as hard as he could in the face and broke my
nose. He knocked me unconscious and then I think he did
things to me. I mean I know he did. Next day I wanted to kill
myself when I saw my face and when I found what he had
done. I thought I would have a baby. I would certainly have
killed myself if I’d had a baby by that man. Anyway, I didn’t,
so that was that. I went to the doctor and he did what he could
for my nose and didn’t charge me anything. I didn’t tell him
about the rest. I was too ashamed. The man didn’t come
back. I waited and did nothing until the next cane-cutting. I’d
got my plan. I was waiting for the Black Widow spiders to
come in for shelter. One day they came. I caught the biggest of
the females and shut her in a box with nothing to eat. They’re
the bad ones, the females. Then I waited for a dark night without
any moon. I took the box with the spider in it and walked
and walked until I came to the man’s house. It was very dark
and I was frightened of the duppies I might meet on the road
but I didn’t see any. I waited in his garden in the bushes and
watched him go up to bed. Then I climbed a tree and got on
to his balcony. I waited there until I heard him snoring and
then I crept through the window. He was lying naked on the
bed under the mosquito net. I lifted the edge and opened the
box and shook the spider out on to his stomach. Then I went
away and came home.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“God Almighty!” said Bond reverently. “What happened
to him?”</p>

<p class="pindent">She said happily, “He took a week to die. It must have hurt
terribly. They do, you know. The obeahmen say there’s
nothing like it.” She paused. When Bond made no comment,
she said anxiously, “You don’t think I did wrong, do you?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It’s not a thing to make a habit of,” said Bond mildly. “But
I can’t say I blame you the way it was. So what happened
then?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well then I just settled down again,” her voice was matter-of-fact.
“I had to concentrate on getting enough food, and of
course all I wanted to do was save up money to get my nose
made good again.” She said persuasively, “It really was quite
a pretty nose before. Do you think the doctors can put it back
to how it was?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“They can make it any shape you like,” said Bond definitely.
“What did you make money at?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It was the encyclopedia. It told me that people collect sea-shells.
That one could sell the rare ones. I talked to the local
schoolmaster, without telling him my secret of course, and he
found out that there’s an American magazine called <span class="it">Nautilus</span>
for shell collectors. I had just enough money to subscribe to it
and I began looking for the shells that people said they wanted
in the advertisements. I wrote to a dealer in Miami and he
started buying from me. It was thrilling. Of course I made some
awful mistakes to begin with. I thought people would like the
prettiest shells, but they don’t. Very often they want the ugliest.
And then when I found rare ones I cleaned them and polished
them to make them look better. That’s wrong too. They want
shells just as they come out of the sea, with the animal in and
all. So I got some formalin from the doctor and put it into the
live shells to stop them smelling and sent them off to this man
in Miami. I only got it right about a year ago and I’ve already
made fifteen pounds. I’d worked out that now I knew how they
wanted them, and if I was lucky, I ought to make at least fifty
pounds a year. Then in ten years I would be able to go to
America and have the operation. And then,” she giggled
delightedly, “I had a terrific stroke of luck. I went over to
Crab Key. I’d been there before, but this was just before
Christmas, and I found these purple shells. They didn’t look
very exciting, but I sent one or two to Miami and the man
wrote back at once and said he could take as many as I could
get at five dollars each for the whole ones. He said that I must
keep the place where they live a dead secret as otherwise we’d
what he called ‘spoil the market’ and the price would get
cheaper. It’s just like having one’s private gold mine. Now
I may be able to save up the money in five years. That’s why I
was so suspicious of you when I found you on my beach. I
thought you’d come to steal my shells.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You gave me a bit of a shock. I thought you must be
Doctor No’s girl friend.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thanks very much.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“But when you’ve had the operation, what are you going to
do then? You can’t got on living alone in a cellar all your life.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I thought I’d be a call girl.” She said it as she might have
said ‘nurse’ or ‘secretary’.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, what do you mean by that?” Perhaps she had picked
up the expression without understanding it.</p>

<p class="pindent">“One of those girls who has a beautiful flat and lovely
clothes. You know what I mean,” she said impatiently. “People
ring them up and come and make love to them and pay them
for it. They get a hundred dollars for each time in New York.
That’s where I thought I’d start. Of course,” she admitted,
“I might have to do it for less to begin with. Until I learned
to do it really well. How much do you pay the untrained ones?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. “I really can’t remember. It’s quite a long
time since I had one.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She sighed. “Yes, I suppose you can have as many women
as you want for nothing. I suppose it’s only the ugly men that
pay. But that can’t be helped. Any kind of job in the big
towns must be dreadful. At least you can earn much more
being a call girl. Then I can come back to Jamaica and buy
Beau Desert. I’d be rich enough to find a nice husband and
have some children. Now that I’ve found these Venus shells
I’ve worked out that I might be back in Jamaica by the time
I’m thirty. Won’t that be lovely?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I like the last part of the plan. But I’m not so sure of the
first. Anyway, where did you find out about these call girls?
Were they under C in the encyclopedia?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course not. Don’t be silly. There was a big case about
them in New York about two years ago. There was a rich
playboy called Jelke. He had a whole string of girls. There
was a lot about the case in the <span class="it">Gleaner</span>. They gave all the
prices and everything. And anyway, there are thousands of
those sort of girls in Kingston, only of course not such good
ones. They only get about five shillings and they have nowhere
to go and do it except the bush. My Nanny told me
about them. She said I mustn’t grow up like them or I’d be
very unhappy. I can see that for only five shillings. But for a
hundred dollars . . . !”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “You wouldn’t be able to keep all of that. You’d
have to have a sort of manager to get the men, and then you’d
have to bribe the police to leave you alone. And you could
easily go to prison if something went wrong. I really don’t
think you’d like the work. I’ll tell you what, with all you know
about animals and insects and so on you could get a wonderful
job looking after them in one of the American zoos. Or what
about the Jamaica Institute? I’m sure you’d like that better.
You’d be just as likely to meet a nice husband. Anyway you
mustn’t think of being a call girl any more. You’ve got a
beautiful body. You must keep it for the men you love.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s what people say in books,” she said doubtfully.
“The trouble is there aren’t any men to love at Beau Desert.”
She said shyly, “You’re the first Englishman I’ve ever talked
to. I liked you from the beginning. I don’t mind telling you
these things at all. I suppose there are plenty of other people
I should like if I could get away.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course there are. Hundreds. And you’re a wonderful
girl. I thought so directly I saw you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Saw my behind, you mean.” The voice was getting drowsy,
but it was full of pleasure.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. “Well, it was a wonderful behind. And the
other side was wonderful too.” Bond’s body began to stir with
the memory of how she had been. He said gruffly, “Now come
on, Honey. It’s time to go to sleep. There’ll be plenty of time
to talk when we get back to Jamaica.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Will there?” she said sleepily. “Promise?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Promise.”</p>

<p class="pindent">He heard her stir in the sleeping-bag. He looked down. He
could just make out the pale profile turned towards him. She
gave the deep sigh of a child before it falls asleep.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was silence in the clearing. It was getting cold. Bond
put his head down on his hunched knees. He knew it was no
good trying to get to sleep. His mind was full of the day and
of this extraordinary Girl Tarzan who had come into his life.
It was as if some beautiful animal had attached itself to him.
There would be no dropping the leash until he had solved her
problems for her. He knew it. Of course there would be no
difficulty about most of them. He could fix the operation—even,
with the help of friends, find a proper job and a home for
her. He had the money. He would buy her dresses, have her
hair done, get her started in the big world. It would be fun.
But what about the other side? What about the physical desire
he felt for her? One could not make love to a child. But was she
a child? There was nothing childish about her body or her
personality. She was fully grown and highly intelligent in her
fashion, and far more capable of taking care of herself than any
girl of twenty Bond had ever met.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s thoughts were interrupted by a tug at his sleeve.
The small voice said, “Why don’t you go to sleep? Are you
cold?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No, I’m fine.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It’s nice and warm in the sleeping-bag. Would you like to
come in? There’s plenty of room.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No thank you, Honey. I’ll be all right.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a pause, then, almost in a whisper, “If you’re
thinking . . . I mean—you don’t have to make love to me . . .
We could go to sleep back to front, you know, like spoons.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Honey, darling, you go to sleep. It’d be lovely to be like
that, but not tonight. Anyway I’ll have to take over from
Quarrel soon.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, I see.” The voice was grudging. “Perhaps when we get
back to Jamaica.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Perhaps.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Promise. I won’t go to sleep until you promise.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said desperately, “Of course I promise. Now go to
sleep, Honeychile.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The voice whispered triumphantly, “Now you owe me
slave-time. You’ve promised. Good night, darling James.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Good night, darling Honey.”</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_12">XII<br class="lgl"/> THE THING</h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="sc">he grip</span> on Bond’s shoulder was urgent. He was instantly
on his feet.</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel whispered fiercely, “Somepn comin’ across de water,
cap’n! It de dragon fo sho!”</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl woke up. She said anxiously, “What’s happened?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “Stay here, Honey! Don’t move. I’ll be back.”
He broke through the bushes on the side away from the
mountain and ran along the sand with Quarrel at his elbow.</p>

<p class="pindent">They came to the tip of the sandspit, twenty yards from the
clearing. They stopped under cover of the final bushes. Bond
parted them and looked through.</p>

<p class="pindent">What was it? Half a mile away, coming across the lake, was
a shapeless thing with two glaring orange eyes with black
pupils. From between these, where the mouth might be,
fluttered a yard of blue flame. The grey luminescence of the
stars showed some kind of domed head above two short batlike
wings. The thing was making a low moaning roar that overlaid
another noise, a deep rhythmic thud. It was coming towards
them at about ten miles an hour, throwing up a creamy wake.</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel whispered, “Gawd, cap’n! What’s dat fearful ting?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stood up. He said shortly, “Don’t know exactly. Some
sort of tractor affair dressed up to frighten. It’s running on a
diesel engine, so you can forget about dragons. Now let’s see.”
Bond spoke half to himself. “No good running away. The
thing’s too fast for us and we know it can go over mangroves
and swamps. Have to fight it here. What’ll its weak spots be?
The drivers. Of course they’ll have protection. We don’t know
how much. Quarrel, you start firing at that dome on top when
it gets to two hundred yards. Aim carefully and keep on
firing. I’ll go for its headlights when it gets to fifty yards. It’s
not running on tracks. Must have some kind of giant tyres,
aeroplane tyres probably. I’ll go for them too. Stay here. I’ll
go ten yards along. They may start firing back and we’ve got to
keep the bullets away from the girl. Okay?” Bond reached out
and squeezed the big shoulder. “And don’t worry too much.
Forget about dragons. It’s just some gadget of Doctor No’s.
We’ll kill the drivers and capture the damn thing and ride it
down to the coast. Save us shoe-leather. Right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel laughed shortly. “Okay, cap’n. Since you says so.
But Ah sho hopes de Almighty knows he’s no dragon too!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond ran down the sand. He broke through the bushes until
he had a clear field of fire. He called softly, “Honey!”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, James.” There was relief in the nearby voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Make a hole in the sand like we did on the beach.
Behind the thickest roots. Get into it and lie down. There may
be some shooting. Don’t worry about dragons. This is just a
painted up motor car with some of Doctor No’s men in it.
Don’t be frightened. I’m quite close.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“All right, James. Be careful.” The voice was high with
fright.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond knelt on one knee in the leaves and sand and peered
out.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now the thing was only about three hundred yards away and
its yellow headlights were lighting up the sandspit. Blue flames
were still fluttering from the mouth. They were coming from a
long snout mocked-up with gaping jaws and gold paint to look
like a dragon’s mouth. Flame-thrower! That would explain the
burned bushes and the warden’s story. The blue flames would
be coming from some kind of an after-burner. The apparatus
was now in neutral. What would its range be when the compression
was unleashed?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had to admit that the thing was an awesome sight as
it moaned forward through the shallow lake. It was obviously
designed to terrify. It would have frightened him but for the
earthy thud of the diesel. Against native intruders it would be
devastating. But how vulnerable would it be to people with
guns who didn’t panic?</p>

<p class="pindent">He was answered at once. There came the crack of Quarrel’s
Remington. A spark flew off the domed cabin and there was a
dull clang. Quarrel fired another single shot and then a burst.
The bullets hammered ineffectually against the cabin. There
was not even a check in speed. The thing rolled on, swerving
slightly to make for the source of the gunfire. Bond cradled
the Smith &amp; Wesson on his forearm and took careful aim. The
deep cough of his gun sounded above the rattle of the Remington.
One of the headlamps shattered and went out. He fired
four shots at the other and got it with the fifth and last round
in the cylinder. The thing didn’t care. It rolled straight on
towards Quarrel’s hiding place. Bond reloaded and began
firing at the huge bulge of the tyres under the bogus black and
gold wings. The range was now only thirty yards and he could
have sworn that he hit the nearest wheel again and again. No
effect. Solid rubber? The first breath of fear stirred Bond’s skin.</p>

<p class="pindent">He reloaded. Was the damn thing vulnerable from the rear?
Should he dash out into the lake and try and board it? He took
a step forward through the bushes. Then he froze, incapable of
movement.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly, from the dribbling snout, a yellow-tipped bolt of
blue flame had howled out towards Quarrel’s hiding place.
There was a single puff of orange and red flame from the bushes
to Bond’s right and one unearthly scream, immediately
choked. Satisfied, the searing tongue of fire licked back into
the snout. The thing turned on its axis and stopped dead. Now
the blue hole of its mouth aimed straight at Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stood and waited for his unspeakable end. He looked
into the blue jaws of death and saw the glowing red filament of
the firer deep inside the big tube. He thought of Quarrel’s
body—there was no time to think of Quarrel—and imagined
the blackened, smoking figure lying in the melted sand. Soon
he, too, would flame like a torch. The single scream would be
wrung from him and his limbs would jerk into the dancing
pose of burned bodies. Then it would be Honey’s turn. Christ,
what had he led them into! Why had he been so insane as to
take on this man with his devastating armoury. Why hadn’t
he been warned by the long finger that had pointed at him in
Jamaica? Bond set his teeth. Hurry up, you bastards. Get it
over.</p>

<p class="pindent">There came the twang of a loud-hailer. A voice howled
metallically, “Come on out, Limey. And the doll. Quick, or
you’ll fry in hell like your pal.” To rub in the command, the
bolt of flame spat briefly towards him. Bond stepped back from
the searing heat. He felt the girl’s body against his back. She
said hysterically, “I had to come. I had to come.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “It’s all right, Honey. Keep behind me.”</p>

<p class="pindent">He had made up his mind. There was no alternative. Even
if death was to come later it couldn’t be worse than this kind of
death. Bond reached for the girl’s hand and drew her after him
out on to the sand.</p>

<p class="pindent">The voice howled. “Stop there. Good boy. And drop the
pea-shooter. No tricks or the crabs’ll be getting a cooked
breakfast.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond dropped his gun. So much for the Smith &amp; Wesson.
The Beretta would have been just as good against this thing.
The girl whimpered. Bond squeezed her hand. “Stick it,
Honey,” he said. “We’ll get out of this somehow.” Bond
sneered at himself for the lie.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was the clang of an iron door being opened. From the
back of the dome a man dropped into the water and walked
towards them. There was a gun in his hand. He kept out of the
line of fire of the flame-thrower. The fluttering blue flame lit up
his sweating face. He was a Chinese Negro, a big man, clad
only in trousers. Something dangled from his left hand. When
he came closer, Bond saw it was handcuffs.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man stopped a few yards away. He said, “Hold out
your hands. Wrists together. Then walk towards me. You first,
Limey. Slowly or you get an extra navel.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond did as he was told. When he was within sweat-smell of
the man, the man put his gun between his teeth and reached
out and snapped the handcuffs on Bond’s wrists. Bond looked
into the face, gumnetal-coloured from the blue flames. It was
a brutal, squinting face. It sneered at him. “Dumb bastard,”
said the man.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned his back on the man and started walking away.
He was going to see Quarrel’s body. He had to say goodbye
to it. There was the roar of a gun. A bullet kicked up sand close
to his feet. Bond stopped and turned slowly round. “Don’t be
nervous,” he said. “I’m going to take a look at the man you’ve
just murdered. I’ll be back.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The man lowered his gun. He laughed harshly. “Okay.
Enjoy yourself. Sorry we ain’t got a wreath. Come back quick
or we give the doll a toastin’. Two minutes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked on towards the smoking clump of bushes. He
got there and looked down. His eyes and mouth winced. Yes,
it had been just as he had visualized. Worse. He said softly,
“I’m sorry, Quarrel.” He kicked into the ground and scooped
up a handful of cool sand between his manacled hands and
poured it over the remains of the eyes. Then he walked slowly
back and stood beside the girl.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man waved them forward with his gun. They walked
round the back of the machine. There was a small square
door. A voice from inside said, “Get in and sit on the floor.
Don’t touch anything or you get your fingers broke.”</p>

<p class="pindent">They scrambled into the iron box. It stank of sweat and oil.
There was just room for them to sit with their knees hunched
up. The man with the gun followed them in and banged the
door. He switched on a light and sat down on an iron tractor
seat beside the driver. He said, “Okay, Sam. Let’s get goin’.
You can put out the fire. It’s light enough to steer by.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a row of dials and switches on the instrument
panel. The driver reached forward and pulled down a couple
of the switches. He put the machine into gear and peered out
through a narrow slit in the iron wall in front of him. Bond felt
the machine turn. There came a faster beat from the engine
and they moved off.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl’s shoulder pressed against his. “Where are they
taking us?” The whisper trembled.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned his head and looked at her. It was the first time
he had been able to see her hair when it was dry. Now it was
disarrayed by sleep, but it was no longer a bunch of rats’ tails.
It hung heavily straight down to her shoulders, where it
curled softly inwards. It was of the palest ash blonde and shone
almost silver under the electric light. She looked up at him.
The skin round her eyes and at the corners of her mouth was
white with fear.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shrugged with an indifference he didn’t feel. He
whispered, “Oh, I expect we’re going to see Doctor No. Don’t
worry too much, Honey. These men are just little gangsters.
It’ll be different with him. When we get to him don’t you say
anything, I’ll talk for both of us.” He pressed her shoulder.
“I like the way you do your hair. I’m glad you don’t cut it too
short.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Some of the tension went out of her face. “How can you
think of things like that?” She half smiled at him. “But I’m
glad you like it. I wash it in coconut oil once a week.” At the
memory of her other life her eyes grew bright with tears. She
bent her head down to her manacled hands to hide her tears.
She whispered almost to herself, “I’ll try to be brave. It’ll be
all right as long as you’re there.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shifted so that he was right up against her. He brought
his handcuffed hands close up to his eyes and examined them.
They were the American police model. He contracted his left
hand, the thinner of the two, and tried to pull it through the
squat ring of steel. Even the sweat on his skin was no help. It
was hopeless.</p>

<p class="pindent">The two men sat on their iron seats with their backs to
them, indifferent. They knew they had total command. There
wasn’t room for Bond to give any trouble. Bond couldn’t stand
up or get enough momentum into his hands to do any damage
to the backs of their heads with his handcuffs. If Bond somehow
managed to open the hatch and drop into the water,
where would that get him? They would at once feel the fresh
air on their backs and stop the machine, and either burn him
in the water or pick him up. It annoyed Bond that they didn’t
worry about him, that they knew he was utterly in their power.
He also didn’t like the idea that these men were intelligent
enough to know that he presented no threat. Stupider men
would have sat over him with a gun out, would have trussed
him and the girl with inexpert thoroughness, might even have
knocked them unconscious. These two knew their business.
They were professionals, or had been trained to be professionals.</p>

<p class="pindent">The two men didn’t talk to each other. There was no nervous
chatter about how clever they had been, about their destination,
about how tired they were. They just drove the machine
quietly, efficiently along, finishing their competent job.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond still had no idea what this contraption was. Under the
black and gold paint and the rest of the fancy dress it was some
sort of a tractor, but of a kind he had never seen or heard of.
The wheels, with their vast smooth rubber tyres, were nearly
twice as tall as himself. He had seen no trade name on the
tyres, it had been too dark, but they were certainly either solid
or filled with porous rubber. At the rear there had been a small
trailing wheel for stability. An iron fin, painted black and gold,
had been added to help the dragon effect. The high mudguards
had been extended into short backswept wings. A long
metal dragon’s head had been added to the front of the radiator
and the headlamps had been given black centres to make ‘eyes’.
That was all there was to it, except that the cabin had been
covered with an armoured dome and the flame-thrower added.
It was, as Bond had thought, a tractor dressed up to frighten
and burn—though why it had a flame-thrower instead of a
machine gun he couldn’t imagine. It was clearly the only sort
of vehicle that could travel the island. Its huge wide wheels
would ride over mangrove and swamp and across the shallow
lake. It would negotiate the rough coral uplands and, since its
threat would be at night, the heat in the iron cabin would
remain at least tolerable.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was impressed. He was always impressed by professionalism.
Doctor No was obviously a man who took
immense pains. Soon Bond would be meeting him. Soon he
would be up against the secret of Doctor No. And then what?
Bond smiled grimly to himself. He wouldn’t be allowed to get
away with his knowledge. He would certainly be killed unless
he could escape or talk his way out. And what about the girl?
Could Bond prove her innocence and have her spared? Conceivably,
but she would never be let off the island. She would
have to stay there for the rest of her life, as the mistress or
wife of one of the men, or Doctor No himself if she appealed
to him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s thoughts were interrupted by rougher going under
the wheels. They had crossed the lake and were on the track
that led up the mountain to the huts. The cabin tilted and the
machine began to climb. In five minutes they would be there.</p>

<p class="pindent">The co-driver glanced over his shoulder at Bond and the
girl. Bond smiled cheerfully up at him. He said, “You’ll get a
medal for this.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The brown and yellow eyes looked impassively into his. The
purple, blubbery lips parted in a sneer in which there was slow
hate: “Shut your ——ing mouth.” The man turned back.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl nudged him and whispered, “Why are they so
rude? Why do they hate us so much?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond grinned down at her, “I expect it’s because we made
them afraid. Perhaps they’re still afraid. That’s because we
don’t seem to be frightened of them. We must keep them that
way.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl pressed against him. “I’ll try.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Now the climb was getting steeper. Grey light showed
through the slots in the armour. Dawn was coming up. Outside,
another day of brazen heat and ugly wind and the smell
of marsh gas would be beginning. Bond thought of Quarrel,
the brave giant who would not be seeing it, with whom they
should now be setting off for the long trek through the mangrove
swamps. He remembered the life insurance. Quarrel had
smelled his death. Yet he had followed Bond unquestioningly.
His faith in Bond had been stronger than his fear. And Bond
had let him down. Would Bond also be the death of the girl?</p>

<p class="pindent">The driver reached forward to the dashboard. From the
front of the machine there sounded the brief howl of a police
siren. It meandered into a dying moan. After a minute the
machine stopped, idling in neutral. The man pressed a switch
and took a microphone off a hook beside him. He spoke into it
and Bond could hear the echoing voice of the loud-hailer outside.
“Okay. Got the Limey and the girl. Other man’s dead.
That’s the lot. Open up.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond heard a door being pulled sideways on iron rollers.
The driver put in the clutch and they rolled slowly forward a
few yards and stopped. The man switched off the engine.
There was a clang as the iron hatch was opened from the outside.
A gush of fresh air and a flood of brighter light came into
the cabin. Hands took hold of Bond and dragged him roughly
out backwards on to a cement floor. Bond stood up. He felt
the prod of a gun in his side. A voice said, “Stay where you
are. No tricks.” Bond looked at the man. He was another
Chinese Negro, from the same stable as the others. The yellow
eyes examined him curiously. Bond turned away indifferently.
Another man was prodding the girl with his gun. Bond said
sharply, “Leave the girl alone.” He walked over and stood
beside her. The two men seemed surprised. They stood,
pointing their guns indecisively.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked around him. They were in one of the Quonset
huts he had seen from the river. It was a garage and workshop.
The ‘dragon’ had been halted over an examination pit in the
concrete. A dismantled outboard motor lay on one of the
benches. Strips of white sodium lighting ran along the ceiling.
There was a smell of oil and exhaust smoke. The driver and his
mate were examining the machine. Now they sauntered up.</p>

<p class="pindent">One of the guards said, “Passed the message along. The
word is to send them through. Everything go okay?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The co-driver, who seemed to be the senior man present,
said, “Sure. Bit of gunfire. Lights gone. May be some holes in
the tyres. Get the boys crackin’—full overhaul. I’ll put these
two through and go get myself some shuteye.” He turned to
Bond. “Okay, git moving,” he gestured down the long hut.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “Get moving yourself. Mind your manners. And
tell those apes to take their guns off us. They might let one off
by mistake. They look dumb enough.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The man came closer. The other three closed up behind
him. Hate shone redly in their eyes. The leading man lifted a
clenched fist as big as a small ham and held it under Bond’s
nose. He was controlling himself with an effort. He said
tensely, “Listen, mister. Sometimes us boys is allowed to join
in the fun at the end. I’m just praying this’ll be one of those
times. Once we made it last a whole week. An’ Jees, if I get
you . . .” He broke off. His eyes were alight with cruelty. He
looked past Bond at the girl. The eyes became mouths that
licked their lips. He wiped his hands down the sides of his
trousers. The tip of his tongue showed pinkly between the
purple lips. He turned to the other three. “What say, fellers?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The three men were also looking at the girl. They nodded
dumbly, like children in front of a Christmas tree.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond longed to run berserk among them, laying into their
faces with his manacled wrists, accepting their bloody revenge.
But for the girl he would have done it. Now all he had achieved
with his brave words was to get her frightened. He said, “All
right, all right. You’re four and we’re two and we’ve got our
hands tied. Come on. We won’t hurt you. Just don’t push us
around too much. Doctor No might not be pleased.”</p>

<p class="pindent">At the name, the men’s faces changed. Three pairs of eyes
looked whitely from Bond to the leader. For a minute the
leader stared suspiciously at Bond, wondering, trying to
fathom whether perhaps Bond had got some edge on their boss.
His mouth opened to say something. He thought better of it.
He said lamely, “Okay, okay. We was just kiddin’.” He turned
to the men for confirmation. “Right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sure! Sure thing.” It was a ragged mumble. The men
looked away.</p>

<p class="pindent">The leader said gruffly, “This way, mister.” He walked off
down the long hut.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took the girl’s wrist and followed. He was impressed
with the weight of Doctor No’s name. That was something to
remember if they had any more dealings with the staff.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man came to a rough wooden door at the end of the
hut. There was a bellpush beside it. He rang twice and waited.
There came a click and the door opened to reveal ten yards of
carpeted rock passage with another door, smarter and cream-painted,
at the end.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man stood aside. “Straight ahead, mister. Knock on
the door. The receptionist’ll take over.” There was no irony in
his voice and his eyes were impassive.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond led the girl into the passage. He heard the door shut
behind them. He stopped and looked down at her. He said,
“Now what?”</p>

<p class="pindent">She smiled tremulously. “It’s nice to feel carpet under one’s
feet.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond squeezed her wrist. He walked forward to the cream-painted
door and knocked.</p>

<p class="pindent">The door opened. Bond went through with the girl at his
heels. When he stopped dead in his tracks, he didn’t feel the
girl bump into him. He just stood and stared.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_13">XIII<br class="lgl"/> MINK-LINED PRISON</h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="sc">t was the</span> sort of reception room the largest American
corporations have on the President’s floor in their New York
skyscrapers. It was of pleasant proportions, about twenty feet
square. The floor was close-carpeted in the thickest wine-red
Wilton and the walls and ceiling were painted a soft dove
grey. Colour lithograph reproductions of Degas ballet sketches
were well hung in groups on the walls and the lighting was by
tall modern standard lamps with dark green silk shades in a
fashionable barrel design.</p>

<p class="pindent">To Bond’s right was a broad mahogany desk with a green
leather top, handsome matching desk furniture and the most
expensive type of intercom. Two tall antique chairs waited for
visitors. On the other side of the room was a refectory-type
table with shiny magazines and two more chairs. On both the
desk and the table were tall vases of freshly cut hibiscus. The
air was fresh and cool and held a slight, expensive fragrance.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were two women in the room. Behind the desk, with
pen poised over a printed form, sat an efficient-looking Chinese
girl with horn-rimmed spectacles below a bang of black hair
cut short. Her eyes and mouth wore the standard receptionist’s
smile of welcome—bright, helpful, inquisitive.</p>

<p class="pindent">Holding the door through which they had come, and waiting
for them to move farther into the room so that she could
close it, stood an older, rather matronly woman of about forty-five.
She also had Chinese blood. Her appearance, wholesome,
bosomy, eager, was almost excessively gracious. Her square
cut pince-nez gleamed with the hostess’s desire to make them
feel at home.</p>

<p class="pindent">Both women were dressed in spotless white, with white
stockings and white suede brogues, like assistants in the most
expensive American beauty-parlours. There was something
soft and colourless about their skins as if they rarely went out
of doors.</p>

<p class="pindent">While Bond took in the scene, the woman at the door
twittered conventional phrases of welcome as if they had been
caught in a storm and had arrived late at a party.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You poor dears. We simply didn’t know when to expect
you. We kept on being told you were on your way. First it was
teatime yesterday, then dinner, and it was only half an hour
ago we heard you would only be here in time for breakfast.
You must be famished. Come along now and help Sister Rose
fill in your forms and then I’ll pack you both straight off to
bed. You must be tired out.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Clucking softly, she closed the door and ushered them
forward to the desk. She got them seated in the chairs and
rattled on. “Now I’m Sister Lily and this is Sister Rose. She
just wants to ask you a few questions. Now, let me see, a
cigarette?” She picked up a tooled leather box. She opened it
and put it on the desk in front of them. It had three compartments.
She pointed with a little finger. “Those are American,
and those are Players, and those are Turkish.” She picked up
an expensive desk-lighter and waited.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond reached out his manacled hands to take a Turkish
cigarette.</p>

<p class="pindent">Sister Lily gave a squeak of dismay. “Oh, but really.”
She sounded genuinely embarrassed. “Sister Rose, the key,
quickly. I’ve said again and again that patients are never to be
brought in like that.” There was impatience and distaste in her
voice. “Really, that outside staff! It’s time they had a talking
to.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Sister Rose was just as much put out. Hastily, she scrabbled
in a drawer and handed a key across to Sister Lily who, with
much cooing and tut-tutting, unlocked the two pairs of handcuffs
and walked behind the desk and dropped them as if they
were dirty bandages into the wastepaper basket.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thank you.” Bond was unable to think of any way to
handle the situation except to fall in with what was happening
on the stage. He reached out and took a cigarette and lit it.
He glanced at Honeychile Rider who sat looking dazed and
nervously clutching the arms of her chair. Bond gave her a
reassuring smile.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Now, if you please.” Sister Rose bent over a long printed
form on expensive paper. “I promise to be as quick as I can.
Your name please Mister—er . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Bryce, John Bryce.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She wrote busily. “Permanent address?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Care of the Royal Zoological Society, Regent’s Park,
London, England.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Profession.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Ornithologist.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh dear,” she dimpled at him, “could you please spell
that?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond did so.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thank you so much. Now, let me see, Purpose of Visit?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Birds,” said Bond. “I am also a representative of the
Audubon Society of New York. They have a lease of part of
this island.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, really.” Bond watched the pen writing down exactly
what he had said. After the last word she put a neat query in
brackets.</p>

<p class="pindent">“And,” Sister Rose smiled politely in the direction of
Honeychile, “your wife? Is she also interested in birds?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, indeed.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“And her first name?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Honeychile.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Sister Rose was delighted. “What a pretty name.” She
wrote busily. “And now just your next of kin and then we’re
finished.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gave M’s real name as next of kin for both of them.
He described him as ‘uncle’ and gave his address as ‘Managing
Director, Universal Export, Regent’s Park, London’.</p>

<p class="pindent">Sister Rose finished writing and said, “There, that’s done.
Thank you so much, Mr Bryce, and I do hope you both enjoy
your stay.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thank you very much. I’m sure we will.” Bond got up.
Honeychile Rider did the same, her face still expressionless.</p>

<p class="pindent">Sister Lily said, “Now come along with me, you poor
dears.” She walked to a door in the far wall. She stopped
with her hand on the cut-glass doorknob. “Oh deary me, now
I’ve gone and forgotten the number of their rooms! It’s the
Cream Suite, isn’t it, Sister?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, that’s right. Fourteen and fifteen.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thank you, my dear. And now,” she opened the door, “if
you’ll just follow me. I’m afraid it’s a terribly long walk.” She
shut the door behind them and led the way. “The Doctor’s
often talked of putting in one of those moving stairway things,
but you know how it is with a busy man,” she laughed gaily.
“So many other things to think of.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, I expect so,” said Bond politely.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took the girl’s hand and they followed the motherly
bustling figure down a hundred yards of lofty corridor in the
same style as the reception room but lit at frequent intervals
by discreetly expensive wall-brackets.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond answered with polite monosyllables the occasional
twittering comments Sister Lily threw over her shoulder. His
whole mind was focused on the extraordinary circumstances of
their reception. He was quite certain the two women had been
genuine. Not a look or a word had been dropped that was out of
place. It was obviously a front of some kind, but a solid one,
meticulously supported by the decor and the cast. The lack
of resonance in the room, and now in the corridor, suggested
that they had stepped from the Quonset hut into the side of
the mountain and that they were now walking through its base.
At a guess they would be walking towards the west—towards
the cliff-face with which the island ended. There was no
moisture on the walls and the air was cool and pure with a
strongish breeze coming towards them. A lot of money and
good engineering had gone into the job. The pallor of the two
women suggested that they spent all their time inside the
mountain. From what Sister Lily had said it sounded as if they
were part of an inside staff that had nothing to do with the
strong-arm squad outside and perhaps didn’t even understand
what sort of men they were.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was grotesque, concluded Bond as they came nearer to a
door at the end of the corridor, dangerously grotesque, but it
was no good wondering about it. He could only follow the lines
of the gracious script. At least this was better than the backstage
of the island outside.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the door, Sister Lily rang. They had been expected. The
door opened at once. An enchanting Chinese girl in a mauve
and white flowered kimono stood smiling and bowing as
Chinese girls are supposed to do. Again there was nothing but
warmth and welcome in the pale, flowerlike face. Sister Lily
cried, “Here they are at last, May! Mr and Mrs John Bryce.
And I know they must be exhausted so we must take them
straight to their rooms for some breakfast and a sleep.” She
turned to Bond. “This is May. Such a dear girl. She will be
looking after you both. Anything you want, just ring for May.
She’s a favourite with all our patients.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Patients, thought Bond. That’s the second time she’s used
the word. He smiled politely at the girl. “How do you do.
Yes, we’d certainly both of us like to get to our rooms.”</p>

<p class="pindent">May embraced them both with a warm smile. She said in a
low, attractive voice, “I do hope you’ll both be comfortable,
Mr Bryce. I took the liberty of ordering breakfast as soon as I
heard you had come in. Shall we . . . ?” Corridors branched off
to left and right of double lift-doors set in the wall opposite.
The girl led the way to the right. Bond and Honeychile followed
with Sister Lily taking up the rear.</p>

<p class="pindent">Numbered doors led off the corridor on either side. Now the
decor was in the lightest pink with a dove grey carpet. The
numbers on the doors were in the tens. The corridor came to
an abrupt end with two doors side by side, 14 and 15. May
opened the door of 14, and they followed her in.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a charming double bedroom in modern Miami style
with dark green walls, dark polished mahogany floor with occasional
thick white rugs, and well-designed bamboo furniture
with a chintz of large red roses on a white background.
There was a communicating door into a more masculine
dressing-room and another that led into an extremely luxurious
modern bathroom with a step-down bath and a bidet.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was like being shown into the very latest Florida hotel
suite—except for two details which Bond noticed. There were
no windows and no inside handles to the doors.</p>

<p class="pindent">May looked hopefully from one to the other.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned to Honeychile. He smiled at her. “It looks very
comfortable, don’t you think, darling?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl played with the edge of her skirt. She nodded, not
looking at him.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a timid knock on the door and another girl, as
pretty as May, tripped in with a loaded tray balanced on her
upturned hand. She put it down on the centre table and pulled
up two chairs. She whisked off the speckless linen cloth that
covered the dishes and pattered out of the room. There was a
delicious smell of bacon and coffee.</p>

<p class="pindent">May and Sister Lily backed to the door. The older woman
stopped on the threshold. “And now we’ll leave you two dear
people in peace. If you want anything, just ring. The bells are
by the bed. Oh, and by the way, you’ll find plenty of fresh
clothes in the cupboards. Chinese style, I’m afraid,” she
twinkled apologetically, “but I hope they’re the right sizes.
The wardrobe room only got the measurements yesterday
evening. The Doctor has given strict orders that you’re not to
be disturbed. He’d be delighted if you’d join him for dinner
this evening. He wants you to have the whole of the rest of the
day to yourselves—to get settled down, you know.” She paused
and looked from one to the other smiling inquiry. “Shall I
say you . . . ?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, please,” said Bond. “Tell the Doctor we shall be
delighted to join him for dinner.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, I know he’ll be so pleased.” With a last twitter the two
women softly withdrew and closed the door behind them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned towards Honeychile. She looked embarrassed.
She still avoided his eyes. It occurred to Bond that she could
never have met such soft treatment or seen such luxury in her
life. To her, all this must be far more strange and terrifying
than what they had gone through outside. She stood and
fiddled at the hem of her Man Friday skirt. There were streaks
of dried sweat and salt and dust on her face. Her bare legs were
filthy and Bond noticed that her toes were moving softly as
they gripped nervously into the wonderful thick pile carpet.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. He laughed with real pleasure that her fear
had been drowned in the basic predicament of clothes and how
to behave, and he laughed at the picture they made—she in her
rags and he in his dirty blue shirt and black jeans and muddy
canvas shoes.</p>

<p class="pindent">He went to her and took her hands. They were cold. He
said, “Honey, we’re a couple of scarecrows. There’s only one
problem. Shall we have breakfast first while it’s hot, or shall
we get out of these rags and have a bath and eat the breakfast
when it’s cold? Don’t worry about anything else. We’re here in
this wonderful little house and that’s all that matters. Now
then, what shall we do?”</p>

<p class="pindent">She smiled uncertainly. The blue eyes searched his face for
reassurance. “You’re not worried about what’s going to happen
to us?” She nodded at the room. “Don’t you think this is all
a trap?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“If it’s a trap we’re in it. There’s nothing we can do now
but eat the cheese. The only question is whether we eat it hot
or cold.” He pressed her hands. “Really, Honey. Leave the
worrying to me. Just think where we were an hour ago. Isn’t
this better? Now come on and decide the really important
things. Bath or breakfast?”</p>

<p class="pindent">She said reluctantly, “Well, if you think . . . I mean—I’d
rather get clean first.” She added quickly, “But you’ve got to
help me.” She jerked her head towards the bathroom door.
“I don’t know how to work one of those places. What do you
do?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said seriously, “It’s quite easy. I’ll fix it all ready for
you. While you’re having your bath, I’ll have my breakfast.
I’ll keep yours warm.” Bond went to one of the built-in clothes
cupboards and ran the door back. There were half a dozen
kimonos, some silk and some linen. He took out a linen one at
random. “You take off your clothes and get into this and I’ll
get the bath ready. Later on you can choose the things you
want to wear for bed and dinner.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She said gratefully, “Oh yes, James. If you’ll just show
me . . .” She started to unbutton her shirt.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond wanted to take her in his arms and kiss her. Instead
he said abruptly, “That’s fine, Honey,” and went into the
bathroom and turned on the taps.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was everything in the bathroom—Floris Lime bath
essence for men and Guerlain bathcubes for women. He
crushed a cube into the water and at once the room smelled
like an orchid house. The soap was Guerlain’s Sapoceti, <span class="it">Fleurs
des Alpes</span>. In a medicine cupboard behind the mirror over the
washbasin were toothbrushes and toothpaste, Steradent toothpicks,
Rose mouthwash, dental floss, aspirin and Milk of Magnesia.
There was also an electric razor, Lentheric aftershave
lotion, and two nylon hairbrushes and combs. Everything
was brand new and untouched.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked at his filthy unshaven face in the mirror and
smiled grimly into the grey, sunburned castaway’s eyes. The
coating on the pill was certainly of the very finest sugar. It
would be wise to expect that the medicine inside would be of
the bitterest.</p>

<p class="pindent">He turned back to the bath and felt the water. It would be
too hot for someone who presumably had never had a hot bath
before. He let in some cold. As he bent over, two arms were
thrown round his neck. He stood up. The golden body blazed
in the white tiled bathroom. She kissed him hard and clumsily
on the lips. He put his arms round her and crushed her to him,
his heart pounding. She said breathlessly at his ear. “The
Chinese dress felt strange. Anyway, you told that woman we
were married.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s hand was on her left breast. Its peak was hard with
passion. Her stomach pressed against his. Why not? Why not?
Don’t be a fool! This is a crazy time for it. You’re both in
deadly danger. You must stay cold as ice to have any chance of
getting out of this mess. Later! Later! Don’t be weak.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took his hand away from her breast and put it round
her neck. He rubbed his face against hers and then brought his
mouth round to hers and gave her one long kiss.</p>

<p class="pindent">He stood away and held her at arm’s length. For a moment
they looked at each other, their eyes bright with desire. She
was breathing fast, her lips parted so that he could see the
glint of teeth. He said unsteadily, “Honey, get into that bath
before I spank you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She smiled. Without saying anything she stepped down into
the bath and lay at full length. She looked up. The fair hair on
her body glittered up through the water like golden sovereigns.
She said provocatively, “You’ve got to wash me. I don’t know
what to do. You’ve got to show me.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said desperately, “Shut up, Honey. And stop flirting.
Just take the soap and the sponge and start scrubbing. Damn
you! This isn’t the time for making love. I’m going to have
breakfast.” He reached for the door handle and opened the
door. She said softly, “James!” He looked back. She was sticking
her tongue out at him. He grinned savagely back at her
and slammed the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond went into the dressing-room and stood in the middle
of the floor and waited for his heart to stop pounding. He
rubbed his hands over his face and shook his head to get rid of
the thought of her.</p>

<p class="pindent">To clear his mind he went carefully over both rooms looking
for exits, possible weapons, microphones—anything that
would add to his knowledge. There were none of these things.
There was an electric clock on the wall which said eight-thirty
and a row of bells beside the double bed. They said, Room
Service, Coiffeur, Manicurist, Maid. There was no telephone.
High up in a corner of both rooms was a small ventilator grille.
Each was about two feet square. Useless. The doors appeared
to be of some light metal, painted to match the walls. Bond
threw the whole weight of his body against one of them. It
didn’t give a millimetre. Bond rubbed his shoulder. The place
was a prison—an exquisite prison. It was no good arguing.
The trap had shut tight on them. Now the only thing for the
mice to do was to make the most of the cheese.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat down at the breakfast table. There was a large
tumbler of pineapple juice in a silver-plated bowl of crushed
ice. He swallowed it down and lifted the cover off his individual
hot-plate. Scrambled eggs on toast, four rashers of bacon, a
grilled kidney and what looked like an English pork sausage.
There were also two kinds of hot toast, rolls inside a napkin,
marmalade, honey and strawberry jam. The coffee was boiling
hot in a large Thermos decanter. The cream smelled fresh.</p>

<p class="pindent">From the bathroom came the sound of the girl crooning
‘Marion’. Bond closed his ears to the sound and started on the
eggs.</p>

<p class="pindent">Ten minutes later, Bond heard the bathroom door open.
He put down his toast and marmalade and covered his eyes
with his hands. She laughed. She said, “He’s a coward. He’s
frightened of a simple girl.” Bond heard her rummaging in
the cupboards. She went on talking, half to herself. “I wonder
why he’s frightened. Of course if I wrestled with him I’d win
easily. Perhaps he’s frightened of that. Perhaps he’s really not
very strong. His arms and his chest look strong enough. I
haven’t seen the rest yet. Perhaps it’s weak. Yes, that must be it.
That’s why he doesn’t dare take his clothes off in front of me.
H’m, now let’s see, would he like me in this?” She raised her
voice. “Darling James, would you like me in white with pale
blue birds flying all over me?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, damn you,” said Bond through his hands. “Now stop
chattering to yourself and come and have breakfast. I’m getting
sleepy.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She gave a cry. “Oh, if you mean it’s time for us to go to
bed, of course I’ll hurry.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a flurry of feet and Bond heard her sit down
opposite. He took his hands down. She was smiling at him.
She looked ravishing. Her hair was dressed and combed and
brushed to kill, with one side falling down the side of the cheek
and the other slicked back behind her ear. Her skin sparkled
with freshness and the big blue eyes were alight with happiness.
Now Bond loved the broken nose. It had become part of his
thoughts of her and it suddenly occurred to him that he would
be sad when she was just an immaculately beautiful girl like
other beautiful girls. But he knew it would be no good trying
to persuade her of that. She sat demurely, with her hands in
her lap below the end of a cleavage which showed half her
breasts and a deep vee of her stomach.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said severely, “Now, listen, Honey. You look wonderful,
but that isn’t the way to wear a kimono. Pull it up right
across your body and tie it tight and stop trying to look like
a call girl. It just isn’t good manners at breakfast.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, you are a stuffy old beast.” She pulled her kimono an
inch or two closer. “Why don’t you like playing? I want to play
at being married.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Not at breakfast time,” said Bond firmly. “Come on and
eat up. It’s delicious. And anyway, I’m filthy. I’m going to
shave and have a bath.” He got up and walked round the table
and kissed the top of her head. “And as for playing, as you
call it, I’d rather play with you than anyone in the world.
But not now.” Without waiting for her answer he walked into
the bathroom and shut the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shaved and had a bath and a shower. He felt desperately
sleepy. Sleep came to him in waves so that from time to time
he had to stop what he was doing and bend his head down
between his knees. When he came to brush his teeth he could
hardly do it. Now he recognized the signs. He had been
drugged. In the coffee or in the pineapple juice? It didn’t
matter. Nothing mattered. All he wanted to do was lie down
on the tiled floor and shut his eyes. Bond weaved drunkenly
to the door. He forgot that he was naked. That didn’t matter
either. Anyway the girl had finished her breakfast. She was in
bed. He staggered over to her, holding on to the furniture. The
kimono was lying in a pile on the floor. She was fast asleep,
naked under a single sheet.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gazed dreamily at the empty pillow beside her head.
No! He found the switches and turned out the lights. Now he
had to crawl across the floor and into his room. He got to his
bed and pulled himself on to it. He reached out an arm of
lead and jabbed at the switch on the bed-light. He missed it.
The lamp crashed to the floor and the bulb burst. With a last
effort Bond turned on his side and let the waves sweep over his
head.</p>

<p class="pindent">The luminous figures on the electric clock in the double room
said nine-thirty.</p>

<p class="noindent"> </p>

<p class="pindent">At ten o’clock the door of the double room opened softly. A
very tall thin figure was silhouetted against the lighted corridor.
It was a man. He must have been six feet six tall. He stood
on the threshold with his arms folded, listening. Satisfied, he
moved slowly into the room and up to the bed. He knew the
way exactly. He bent down and listened to the quiet breathing
of the girl. After a moment he reached up to his chest and
pressed a switch. A flashlight with a very broad diffused beam
came on. The flashlight was attached to him by a belt that
held it above the breast bone. He bent forward so that the soft
light shone on the girl’s face.</p>

<p class="pindent">The intruder examined the girl’s face for several minutes.
One of his hands came up and took the sheet at her chin and
softly drew the sheet down to the end of the bed. The hand
that drew down the sheet was not a hand. It was a pair of
articulated steel pincers at the end of a metal stalk that disappeared
into a black silk sleeve. It was a mechanical hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man gazed for a long time at the naked body, moving
his chest to and fro so that every corner of the body came
under the light. Then the claw came out again and delicately
lifted a corner of the sheet from the bottom of the bed and
drew it back over the girl. The man stood for another moment
gazing down at the sleeping face, then he switched off the
torch on his chest and moved quietly away across the room to
the open door through which Bond was sleeping.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man spent longer beside Bond’s bed. He scrutinized
every line, every shadow on the dark, rather cruel face that lay
drowned, almost extinct, on the pillow. He watched the pulse
in the neck and counted it and, when he had pulled down
the sheet, he did the same with the area round the heart. He
gauged the curve of the muscles on Bond’s arms and thighs
and looked thoughtfully at the hidden strength in the flat
stomach. He even bent down close over the outflung open
right hand and examined its life and fate lines.</p>

<p class="pindent">Finally, with infinite care, the steel claw drew the sheet
back up to Bond’s neck. For another minute the tall figure
stood over the sleeping man, then it swished softly away and
out into the corridor and the door closed with a click.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_14">XIV<br class="lgl"/> COME INTO MY PARLOUR</h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="sc">he electric</span> clock in the cool dark room in the heart
of the mountain showed four-thirty.</p>

<p class="pindent">Outside the mountain, Crab Key had sweltered and stunk
its way through another day. At the eastern end of the island,
the mass of birds, Louisiana herons, pelicans, avocets, sandpipers,
egrets, flamingoes and the few roseate spoonbills, went
on with building their nests or fished in the shallow waters
of the lake. Most of the birds had been disturbed so often that
year that they had given up any idea of building. In the past
few months they had been raided at regular intervals by
the monster that came at night and burned down their roosting
places and the beginnings of their nests. This year many
would not breed. There would be vague movements to migrate
and many would die of the nervous hysteria that seizes bird
colonies when they no longer have peace and privacy.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the other end of the island, on the guanera that gave the
mountain its snow-covered look, the vast swarm of cormorants
had passed their usual day of gorging themselves with fish
and paying back the ounce of precious manure to their owner
and protector. Nothing had interfered with <span class="it">their</span> nesting
season. Now they were noisily fiddling with the untidy piles of
sticks that would be their nests—each pile at exactly sixty
centimetres from the next, for the guanay is a quarrelsome
bird and this sixty-centimetre ring represents their sparring
space. Soon the females would be laying the three eggs from
which their master’s flock would be increased by an average
of two young cormorants.</p>

<p class="pindent">Below the peak, where the diggings began, the hundred or
so Negro men and women who were the labour force were
coming to the end of the day’s shift. Another fifty cubic yards
of guano had been dug out of the mountainside and another
twenty yards of terrace had been added to the working level.
Below, the mountainside looked like terraced vineyards in
Upper Italy, except that here there were no vines, only deep
barren shelves cut in the mountainside. And here, instead of
the stink of marsh gas on the rest of the island, there was a
strong ammoniac smell, and the ugly hot wind that kept the
diggings dry blew the freshly turned whitish-brown dust into
the eyes and ears and noses of the diggers. But the workers
were used to the smell and the dust, and it was easy, healthy
work. They had no complaints.</p>

<p class="pindent">The last iron truck of the day started off on the Decauville
Track that snaked down the mountainside to the crusher and
separator. A whistle blew and the workers shouldered their
clumsy picks and moved lazily down towards the high-wired
group of Quonset huts that was their compound. Tomorrow,
on the other side of the mountain, the monthly ship would be
coming in to the deep-water quay they had helped to build
ten years before, but which, since then, they had never seen.
That would mean fresh stores and fresh goods and cheap
jewellery at the canteen. It would be a holiday. There would be
rum and dancing and a few fights. Life was good.</p>

<p class="pindent">Life was good, too, for the senior outside staff—all Chinese
Negroes like the men who had hunted Bond and Quarrel and
the girl. They also stopped work in the garage and the machine
shops and at the guard posts and filtered off to the ‘officers’
quarters. Apart from watch and loading duties, tomorrow
would also be a holiday for most of them. They too would have
their drinking and dancing, and there would be a new monthly
batch of girls from ‘inside’. Some ‘marriages’ from the last lot
would continue for further months or weeks according to the
taste of the ‘husband’, but for the others there would be a
fresh choice. There would be some of the older girls who had
had their babies in the creche and were coming back for a
fresh spell of duty ‘outside’, and there would be a sprinkling
of young ones who had come of age and would be ‘coming out’
for the first time. There would be fights over these and blood
would be shed, but in the end the officers’ quarters would
settle down for another month of communal life, each officer
with his woman to look after his needs.</p>

<p class="pindent">Deep down in the cool heart of the mountain, far below
this well-disciplined surface life, Bond awoke in his comfortable
bed. Apart from a slight nembutal headache he felt fit and
rested. Lights were on in the girl’s room and he could hear
her moving about. He swung his feet to the ground and,
avoiding the fragments of glass from the broken lamp, walked
softly over to the clothes cupboard and put on the first kimono
that came to his hand. He went to the door. The girl had a pile
of kimonos out on the bed and was trying them on in front of
the wall mirror. She had on a very smart one in sky-blue silk.
It looked wonderful against the gold of her skin. Bond said,
“That’s the one.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She whirled round, her hand at her mouth. She took it
down. “Oh, it’s you!” She smiled at him. “I thought you’d
never wake up. I’ve been to look at you several times. I’d
made up my mind to wake you at five. It’s half-past four and
I’m hungry. Can you get us something to eat?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Why not,” Bond walked across to her bed. As he passed her
he put his arm round her waist and took her with him. He
examined the bells. He pressed the one marked ‘Room Service’.
He said, “What about the others? Let’s have the full treatment.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She giggled. “But what’s a manicurist?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Someone who does your nails. We must look our best for
Doctor No.” At the back of Bond’s mind was the urgent
necessity to get his hands on some kind of weapon—a pair
of scissors would be better than nothing. Anything would do.</p>

<p class="pindent">He pressed two more bells. He let her go and looked round
the room. Someone had come while they were asleep and taken
away the breakfast things. There was a drink tray on a sideboard
against the wall. Bond went over and examined it. It
had everything. Propped among the bottles were two menus,
huge double-folio pages covered with print. They might have
been from the Savoy Grill, or the ‘21’, or the Tour d’Argent.
Bond ran his eye down one of them. It began with <span class="it">Caviar
double de Beluga</span> and ended with <span class="it">Sorbet à la Champagne</span>. In
between was every dish whose constituents would not be
ruined by a deep freeze. Bond tossed it down. One certainly
couldn’t grumble about the quality of the cheese in the trap!</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a knock on the door and the exquisite May came
in. She was followed by two other twittering Chinese girls.
Bond brushed aside their amiabilities, ordered tea and buttered
toast for Honeychile and told them to look after her hair and
nails. Then he went into the bathroom and had a couple of
Aspirins and a cold shower. He put on his kimono again,
reflected that he looked idiotic in it, and went back into the
room. A beaming May asked if he would be good enough
to select what he and Mrs Bryce could care to have for dinner.
Without enthusiasm, Bond ordered caviar, grilled lamb
cutlets and salad, and angels on horseback for himself. When
Honeychile refused to make any suggestions, he chose melon,
roast chicken à l’Anglaise and vanilla ice cream with hot chocolate
sauce for her.</p>

<p class="pindent">May dimpled her enthusiasm and approval. “The Doctor
asks if seven forty-five for eight would be convenient.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said curtly that it would.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thank you so much, Mr Bryce. I will call for you at seven
forty-four.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked over to where Honeychile was being ministered
to at the dressing table. He watched the busy delicate fingers
at work on her hair and her nails. She smiled at him excitedly
in the mirror. He said gruffly, “Don’t let them make too much
of a monkey out of you,” and went to the drink tray. He
poured himself out a stiff Bourbon and soda and took it into
his own room. So much for his idea of getting hold of a weapon.
The scissors and files and probes were attached to the manicurist’s
waist by a chain. So were the scissors of the hairdresser.
Bond sat down on his rumpled bed and lost himself in drink
and gloomy reflections.</p>

<p class="pindent">The women went. The girl looked in at him. When he
didn’t lift his head she went back into her room and left him
alone. In due course Bond came into her room to get himself
another drink. He said perfunctorily, “Honey, you look
wonderful.” He glanced at the clock on the wall and went
back and drank his drink and put on another of the idiotic
kimonos, a plain black one.</p>

<p class="pindent">In due course there came the soft knock on the door and the
two of them went silently out of the room and along the empty,
gracious corridor. May stopped at the lift. Its doors were held
open by another eager Chinese girl. They walked in and the
doors shut. Bond noticed that the lift was made by Waygood
Otis. Everything in the prison was de luxe. He gave an inward
shudder of distaste. He noticed the reaction. He turned to the
girl. “I’m sorry, Honey. Got a bit of a headache.” He didn’t
want to tell her that all this luxury play-acting was getting him
down, that he hadn’t the smallest idea what it was all about,
that he knew it was bad news, and that he hadn’t an inkling of
a plan of how to get them out of whatever situation they were
in. That was the worst of it. There was nothing that depressed
Bond’s spirit so much as the knowledge that he hadn’t one line
of either attack or defence.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl moved closer to him. She said, “I’m sorry, James. I
hope it will go away. You’re not angry with me about anything?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond dredged up a smile. He said, “No, darling. I’m only
angry with myself.” He lowered his voice: “Now, about this
evening. Just leave the talking to me. Be natural and don’t be
worried by Doctor No. He may be a bit mad.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She nodded solemnly. “I’ll do my best.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The lift sighed to a stop. Bond had no idea how far down
they had gone—a hundred feet, two hundred? The automatic
doors hissed back and Bond and the girl stepped out into a
large room.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was empty. It was a high-ceilinged room about sixty feet
long, lined on three sides with books to the ceiling. At first
glance, the fourth wall seemed to be made of solid blue-black
glass. The room appeared to be a combined study and library.
There was a big paper-strewn desk in one corner and a central
table with periodicals and newspapers. Comfortable club chairs,
upholstered in red leather, were dotted about. The carpet
was dark green, and the lighting, from standard lamps, was
subdued. The only odd feature was that the drink tray and
sideboard were up against the middle of the long glass wall, and
chairs and occasional tables with ashtrays were arranged in a
semi-circle round it so that the room was centred in front of the
empty wall.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s eye caught a swirl of movement in the dark glass. He
walked across the room. A silvery spray of small fish with a
bigger fish in pursuit fled across the dark blue. They disappeared,
so to speak, off the edge of the screen. What was this?
An aquarium? Bond looked upwards. A yard below the ceiling,
small waves were lapping at the glass. Above the waves was a
strip of greyer blue-black, dotted with sparks of light. The
outlines of Orion were the clue. This was not an aquarium.
This was the sea itself and the night sky. The whole of one
side of the room was made of armoured glass. They were under
the sea, looking straight into its heart, twenty feet down.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond and the girl stood transfixed. As they watched, there
was the glimpse of two great goggling orbs. A golden sheen
of head and deep flank showed for an instant and was gone.
A big grouper? A silver swarm of anchovies stopped and
hovered and sped away. The twenty-foot tendrils of a Portuguese
man-o’-war drifted slowly across the window, glinting
violet as they caught the light. Up above there was the dark
mass of its underbelly and the outline of its inflated bladder,
steering with the breeze.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked along the wall, fascinated by the idea of living
with this slow, endlessly changing moving picture. A big tulip
shell was progressing slowly up the window from the floor
level, a frisk of demoiselles and angel fish and a ruby-red
moonlight snapper were nudging and rubbing themselves
against a corner of the glass, and a sea centipede quested along,
nibbling at the minute algae that must grow every day on the
outside of the window. A long dark shadow paused in the
centre of the window and then moved slowly away. If only one
could see more!</p>

<p class="pindent">Obediently, two great shafts of light, from off the ‘screen’,
lanced out into the water. For an instant they searched independently.
Then they converged on the departing shadow and
the dull grey torpedo of a twelve-foot shark showed up in all
its detail. Bond could even see the piglike pink eyes roll
inquisitively in the light and the slow pulse of the slanting
gill-rakers. For an instant the shark turned straight into the converged
beam and the white half-moon mouth showed below
the reptile’s flat head. It stood poised for a second and then,
with an elegant, disdainful swirl, the great swept-back tail
came round and with a lightning quiver the shark had gone.</p>

<p class="pindent">The searchlights went out. Bond turned slowly. He expected
to see Doctor No, but still the room was empty. It looked
static and lifeless compared with the pulsing mysteries outside
the window. Bond looked back. What must this be like in the
colours of day, when one could see everything perhaps for
twenty yards or more? What must it be like in a storm when
the waves crashed noiselessly against the glass, delving almost
to the floor and then sweeping up and out of sight? What must
it be like in the evening when the last golden shafts of the sun
shone into the upper half of the room and the waters below
were full of dancing motes and tiny water insects? What an
amazing man this must be who had thought of this fantastically
beautiful conception, and what an extraordinary engineering
feat to have carried it out! How had he done it? There could
only be one way. He must have built the glass wall deep inside
the cliff and then delicately removed layer after layer of the
outside rock until the divers could prise off the last skin of
coral. But how thick was the glass? Who had rolled it for him?
How had he got it to the island? How many divers had he used?
How much, God in heaven, could it have cost?</p>

<p class="pindent">“One million dollars.”</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a cavernous, echoing voice, with a trace of American
accent.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned slowly, almost reluctantly, away from the
window.</p>

<p class="pindent">Doctor No had come through a door behind his desk. He
stood looking at them benignly, with a thin smile on his lips.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I expect you were wondering about the cost. My guests
usually think about the material side after about fifteen
minutes. Were you?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I was.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Still smiling (Bond was to get used to that thin smile),
Doctor No came slowly out from behind the desk and moved
towards them. He seemed to glide rather than take steps. His
knees did not dent the matt, gunmetal sheen of his kimono and
no shoes showed below the sweeping hem.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s first impression was of thinness and erectness and
height. Doctor No was at least six inches taller than Bond,
but the straight immovable poise of his body made him seem
still taller. The head also was elongated and tapered from a
round, completely bald skull down to a sharp chin so that the
impression was of a reversed raindrop—or rather oildrop, for
the skin was of a deep almost translucent yellow.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was impossible to tell Doctor No’s age: as far as Bond
could see, there were no lines on the face. It was odd to see
a forehead as smooth as the top of the polished skull. Even
the cavernous indrawn cheeks below the prominent cheekbones
looked as smooth as fine ivory. There was something
Dali-esque about the eyebrows, which were fine and black
and sharply upswept as if they had been painted on as makeup
for a conjurer. Below them, slanting jet black eyes stared
out of the skull. They were without eyelashes. They looked
like the mouths of two small revolvers, direct and unblinking
and totally devoid of expression. The thin fine nose ended very
close above a wide compressed wound of a mouth which,
despite its almost permanent sketch of a smile, showed only
cruelty and authority. The chin was indrawn towards the neck.
Later Bond was to notice that it rarely moved more than
slightly away from centre, giving the impression that the head
and the vertebra were in one piece.</p>

<p class="pindent">The bizarre, gliding figure looked like a giant venomous
worm wrapped in grey tin-foil, and Bond would not have been
surprised to see the rest of it trailing slimily along the carpet
behind.</p>

<p class="pindent">Doctor No came within three steps of them and stopped.
The wound in the tall face opened. “Forgive me for not
shaking hands with you,” the deep voice was flat and even.
“I am unable to.” Slowly the sleeves parted and opened. “I
have no hands.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The two pairs of steel pincers came out on their gleaming
stalks and were held up for inspection like the hands of a
praying mantis. Then the two sleeves joined again.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond felt the girl at his side give a start.</p>

<p class="pindent">The black apertures turned towards her. They slid down
to her nose. The voice said flatly, “It is a misfortune.” The
eyes came back to Bond. “You were admiring my aquarium.”
It was a statement, not a question. “Man enjoys the beasts
and the birds. I decided to enjoy also the fish. I find them
far more varied and interesting. I am sure you both share my
enthusiasm.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “I congratulate you. I shall never forget this
room.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No.” Again a statement, perhaps with a sardonic inflection,
of fact. “But we have much to talk about. And so little time.
Please sit down. You will have a drink? Cigarettes are beside
your chairs.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Doctor No moved to a high leather chair and folded himself
down on to the seat. Bond took the chair opposite. The girl
sat between them and slightly back.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond felt a movement behind him. He looked over his
shoulder. A short man, a Chinese Negro, with the build of a
wrestler, stood at the drink tray. He was dressed in black
trousers and a smart white jacket. Black almond eyes in a wide
moon face met his and slid incuriously away.</p>

<p class="pindent">Doctor No said, “This is my bodyguard. He is expert in
many things. There is no mystery about his sudden appearance.
I always carry what is known as a walkie-talkie here,” he
inclined his chin towards the bosom of his kimono. “Thus I
can summon him when he is needed. What will the girl have?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Not ‘Your Wife’. Bond turned to Honeychile. Her eyes
were wide and staring. She said quietly, “A Coca-Cola, please.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond felt a moment of relief. At least she was not being got
down by the performance. Bond said, “And I would like a
medium Vodka dry Martini—with a slice of lemon peel. Shaken
and not stirred, please. I would prefer Russian or Polish vodka.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Doctor No gave his thin smile an extra crease. “I see you
are also a man who knows what he wants. On this occasion
your desires will be satisfied. Do you not find that it is generally
so? When one wants a thing one gets it? That is my experience.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“The small things.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“If you fail at the large things it means you have not large
ambitions. Concentration, focus—that is all. The aptitudes
come, the tools forge themselves. ‘Give me a fulcrum and I
will move the world’—but only if the desire to move the
world is there.” The thin lips bent minutely downwards in
deprecation. “But this is chatter. We are making conversation.
Instead, let us talk. Both of us, I am sure, prefer talk to conversation.
Is the Martini to your liking? You have cigarettes—enough
and the right sort to cosset your cancer? So be it.
Sam-sam, put the shaker beside the man and another bottle
of Coca-Cola beside the girl. It should now be eight-ten. We
will have dinner at nine o’clock precisely.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Doctor No sat slightly more upright in his chair. He inclined
himself forward, staring at Bond. There was a moment’s
silence in the room. Then Doctor No said, “And now Mister
James Bond of the Secret Service, let us tell each other our
secrets. First, to show you that I hide nothing, I will tell you
mine. Then you will tell me yours.” Doctor No’s eyes blazed
darkly. “But let us tell each other the truth.” He drew one
steel claw out of the wide sleeve and held it upwards. He
paused, “I shall do so. But you must do the same. If you do
not, these,” he pointed the claw at his eyes, “will know that
you are lying.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Doctor No brought the steel claw delicately in front of each
eye and tapped the centre of each eyeball.</p>

<p class="pindent">Each eyeball in turn emitted a dull ting. “These,” said
Doctor No, “see everything.”</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_15">XV<br class="lgl"/> PANDORA’S BOX</h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">J</span><span class="sc">ames Bond</span> picked up his glass and sipped at it thoughtfully.
It seemed pointless to go on bluffing. His story of
representing the Audubon Society was anyway a thin one
which could be punctured by anyone who knew about birds.
It was obvious that his own cover was in shreds. He must
concentrate on protecting the girl. To begin with he must
reassure her.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled at Doctor No. He said, “I know about your
contact in King’s House, Miss Taro. She is your agent. I
have recorded the fact and it will be divulged in certain
circumstances”—Doctor No’s expression showed no interest—“as
will other facts. But, if we are to have a talk, let us have
it without any more stage effects. You are an interesting man.
But it is not necessary to make yourself more interesting than
you are. You have suffered the misfortune of losing your hands.
You wear mechanical hands. Many men wounded in the war
wear them. You wear contact lenses instead of spectacles. You
use a walkie-talkie instead of a bell to summon your servant.
No doubt you have other tricks. But, Doctor No, you are still
a man who sleeps and eats and defecates like the rest of us. So
no more conjuring tricks, please. I am not one of your guano
diggers and I am not impressed by them.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Doctor No inclined his head a fraction. “Bravely spoken,
Mister Bond. I accept the rebuke. I have no doubt developed
annoying mannerisms from living too long in the company of
apes. But do not mistake these mannerisms for bluff. I am a
technician. I suit the tool to the material. I possess also a
range of tools for working with refractory materials. However,”
Doctor No raised his joined sleeves an inch and let them fall
back in his lap, “let us proceed with our talk. It is a rare
pleasure to have an intelligent listener and I shall enjoy telling
you the story of one of the most remarkable men in the world.
You are the first person to hear it. I have not told it before.
You are the only person I have ever met who will appreciate
my story and also—” Doctor No paused for the significance
of the last words to make itself felt—“keep it to himself.”
He continued, “The second of these considerations also applies
to the girl.”</p>

<p class="pindent">So that was it. There had been little doubt in Bond’s mind
ever since the Spandau had opened up on them, and since,
even before then, in Jamaica, where the attempts on him had
not been half-hearted. Bond had assumed from the first that
this man was a killer, that it would be a duel to the death. He
had had his usual blind faith that he would win the duel—all
the way until the moment when the flame-thrower had pointed
at him. Then he had begun to doubt. Now he knew. This man
was too strong, too well equipped.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “There is no point in the girl hearing this. She
has nothing to do with me. I found her yesterday on the beach.
She is a Jamaican from Morgan’s Harbour. She collects shells.
Your men destroyed her canoe so I had to bring her with me.
Send her away now and then back home. She won’t talk. She
will swear not to.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl interrupted fiercely. “I <span class="it">will</span> talk! I shall tell everything.
I’m not going to move. I’m going to stay with you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked at her. He said icily, “I don’t want you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Doctor No said softly, “Do not waste your breath on these
heroics. Nobody who comes to this island has ever left it. Do
you understand? Nobody—not even the simplest fisherman.
It is not my policy. Do not argue with me or attempt to bluff
me. It is entirely useless.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond examined the face. There was no anger in it, no
obstinacy—nothing but a supreme indifference. He shrugged
his shoulders. He looked at the girl and smiled. He said, “All
right, Honey. And I didn’t mean it. I’d hate you to go away.
We’ll stay together and listen to what the maniac has to say.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl nodded happily. It was as if her lover had threatened
to send her out of the cinema and now had relented.</p>

<p class="pindent">Doctor No said, in the same soft resonant voice, “You are
right, Mister Bond. That is just what I am, a maniac. All the
greatest men are maniacs. They are possessed by a mania
which drives them forward towards their goal. The great
scientists, the philosophers, the religious leaders—all maniacs.
What else but a blind singleness of purpose could have given
focus to their genius, would have kept them in the groove of
their purpose? Mania, my dear Mister Bond, is as priceless
as genius. Dissipation of energy, fragmentation of vision, loss
of momentum, the lack of follow-through—these are the vices
of the herd.” Doctor No sat slightly back in his chair. “I do
not possess these vices. I am, as you correctly say, a maniac—a
maniac, Mister Bond, with a mania for power. That”—the
black holes glittered blankly at Bond through the contact lenses—“is
the meaning of my life. That is why I am here. That is
why you are here. That is why here exists.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond picked up his glass and drained it. He filled it again
from the shaker. He said, “I’m not surprised. It’s the old business
of thinking you’re the King of England, or the President
of the United States, or God. The asylums are full of them.
The only difference is that instead of being shut up, you’ve
built your own asylum and shut yourself up in it. But why did
you do it? Why does sitting shut up in this cell give you the
illusion of power?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Irritation flickered at the corner of the thin mouth. “Mister
Bond, power is sovereignty. Clausewitz’s first principle was
to have a secure base. From there one proceeds to freedom of
action. Together, that is sovereignty. I have secured these
things and much besides. No one else in the world possesses
them to the same degree. They <span class="it">cannot</span> have them. The world
is too public. These things can only be secured in privacy.
You talk of kings and presidents. How much power do they
possess? As much as their people will allow them. Who in the
world has the power of life or death over his people? Now that
Stalin is dead, can you name any man except myself? And how
do I possess that power, that sovereignty? Through privacy.
Through the fact that nobody <span class="it">knows</span>. Through the fact that I
have to account to no one.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shrugged. “That is only the illusion of power, Doctor
No. Any man with a loaded revolver has the power of life
and death over his neighbour. Other people beside you have
murdered in secret and got away with it. In the end they
generally get their deserts. A greater power than they possess
is exerted upon them by the community. That will happen to
you, Doctor No. I tell you, your search for power is an illusion
because power itself is an illusion.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Doctor No said equably, “So is beauty, Mister Bond. So
is art, so is money, so is death. And so, probably, is life. These
concepts are relative. Your play upon words does not shake
me. I know philosophy, I know ethics, and I know logic—better
than you do, I daresay. But let us move away from this
sterile debate. Let us return to where I began, with my mania
for power, or, if you wish it, for the illusion of power. And
please, Mister Bond,” again the extra crease in the fixed smile,
“please do not imagine that half an hour’s conversation with
you will alter the pattern of my life. Interest yourself rather
in the history of my pursuit, let us put it, of an illusion.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Go ahead.” Bond glanced at the girl. She caught his eyes.
She put her hand up to her mouth as if to conceal a yawn.
Bond grinned at her. He wondered when it would amuse
Doctor No to crack her pose of indifference.</p>

<p class="pindent">Doctor No said benignly, “I shall endeavour not to bore
you. Facts are so much more interesting than theories, don’t
you agree?” Doctor No was not expecting a reply. He fixed his
eye on the elegant tulip shell that had now wandered half way
up the outside of the dark window. Some small silver fish
squirted across the black void. A bluish prickle of phosphorescence
meandered vaguely. Up by the ceiling, the stars shone
more brightly through the glass.</p>

<p class="pindent">The artificiality of the scene inside the room—the three
people sitting in the comfortable chairs, the drinks on the sideboard,
the rich carpet, the shaded lights, suddenly seemed
ludicrous to Bond. Even the drama of it, the danger, were
fragile things compared with the progress of the tulip shell
up the glass outside. Supposing the glass burst. Supposing
the stresses had been badly calculated, the workmanship faulty.
Supposing the sea decided to lean a little more heavily against
the window.</p>

<p class="pindent">Doctor No said, “I was the only son of a German Methodist
missionary and a Chinese girl of good family. I was born in
Pekin, but on what is known as ‘the wrong side of the blanket’.
I was an encumbrance. An aunt of my mother was paid to
bring me up.” Doctor No paused. “No love, you see, Mister
Bond. Lack of parental care.” He went on, “The seed was
sown. I went to work in Shanghai. I became involved with the
Tongs, with their illicit proceedings. I enjoyed the conspiracies,
the burglaries, the murders, the arson of insured properties.
They represented revolt against the father figure who had
betrayed me. I loved the death and destruction of people and
things. I became adept in the technique of criminality—if you
wish to call it that. Then there was trouble. I had to be got out
of the way. The Tongs considered me too valuable to kill.
I was smuggled to the United States. I settled in New York.
I had been given a letter of introduction, in code, to one of the
two most powerful Tongs in America—the Hip Sings. I never
knew what the letter said, but they took me on at once as a
confidential clerk. In due course, at the age of thirty, I was
made the equivalent of treasurer. The treasury contained over
a million dollars. I coveted this money. Then began the great
Tong wars of the late ’twenties. The two great New York
Tongs, my own, the Hip Sings, and our rival, the On Lee
Ongs, joined in combat. Over the weeks hundreds on both
sides were killed and their houses and properties burned to the
ground. It was a time of torture and murder and arson in which
I joined with delight. Then the riot squads came. Almost the
whole police force of New York was mobilized. The two underground
armies were prised apart and the headquarters of the
two Tongs were raided and the ringleaders sent to jail. I was
tipped off about the raid on my own Tong, the Hip Sings. A
few hours before it was due, I got to the safe and rifled the
million dollars in gold and disappeared into Harlem and went
to ground. I was foolish. I should have left America, gone to
the farthest corner of the earth. Even from the condemned
cells in Sing Sing the heads of my Tong reached out for me.
They found me. The killers came in the night. They tortured
me. I would not say where the gold was. They tortured me all
through the night. Then, when they could not break me, they
cut off my hands to show that the corpse was that of a thief, and
they shot me through the heart and went away. But they did
not know something about me. I am the one man in a million
who has his heart on the right side of his body. Those are the
odds against it, one in a million. I lived. By sheer willpower I
survived the operation and the months in hospital. And all the
time I planned and planned how to get away with the money—how
to keep it, what to do with it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Doctor No paused. There was a slight flush at his temples.
His body fidgeted inside his kimono. His memories had excited
him. For a moment he closed his eyes, composing himself.
Bond thought, now! Shall I leap at him and kill him? Break
off my glass and do it with the jagged stem?</p>

<p class="pindent">The eyes opened. “I am not boring you? You are sure? For
an instant I felt your attention wandering.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No.” The moment had passed. Would there be others?
Bond measured the inches of the leap: noted that the jugular
vein was in full view above the neck of the kimono.</p>

<p class="pindent">The thin purple lips parted and the story went on. “It was,
Mister Bond, a time for clear, firm decisions. When they let
me out of the hospital I went to Silberstein, the greatest stamp
dealer in New York. I bought an envelope, just one envelope,
full of the rarest postage stamps in the world. I took weeks to
get them together. But I didn’t mind what I paid—in New
York, London, Paris, Zurich. I wanted my gold to be mobile.
I invested it all in these stamps. I had foreseen the World War.
I knew there would be inflation. I knew the best would appreciate,
or at least hold its value. And meanwhile I was changing
my appearance. I had all my hair taken out by the roots, my
thick nose made thin, my mouth widened, my lips sliced. I
could not get smaller, so I made myself taller. I wore built up
shoes. I had weeks of traction on my spine. I held myself
differently. I put away my mechanical hands and wore hands
of wax inside gloves. I changed my name to Julius No—the
Julius after my father and the No for my rejection of him and
of all authority. I threw away my spectacles and wore contact
lenses—one of the first pairs ever built. Then I went to Milwaukee,
where there are no Chinamen, and enrolled myself
in the faculty of medicine. I hid myself in the academic world,
the world of libraries and laboratories and classrooms and
campuses. And there, Mister Bond, I lost myself in the study
of the human body and the human mind. Why? Because I
wished to know what this clay is capable of. I had to learn
what my tools were before I put them to use on my next goal—total
security from physical weaknesses, from material
dangers and from the hazards of living. Then, Mister Bond,
from that secure base, armoured even against the casual slings
and arrows of the world, I would proceed to the achievement
of power—the power, Mister Bond, to do unto others what had
been done unto me, the power of life and death, the power to
decide, to judge, the power of absolute independence from
outside authority. For that, Mister Bond, whether you like it
or not, is the essence of temporal power.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond reached for the shaker and poured himself a third
drink. He looked at Honeychile. She seemed composed and
indifferent—as if her mind was on other things. She smiled at
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Doctor No said benignly. “I expect you are both hungry.
Pray be patient. I will be brief. So, if you recall, there I was,
in Milwaukee. In due course, I completed my studies and I
left America and went by easy stages round the world. I called
myself ‘doctor’ because doctors receive confidences and they
can ask questions without arousing suspicion. I was looking
for my headquarters. It had to be safe from the coming war,
it had to be an island, it had to be entirely private, and it had
to be capable of industrial development. In the end I purchased
Crab Key. And here I have remained for fourteen years. They
have been secure and fruitful years, without a cloud on the
horizon. I was entertained by the idea of converting bird dung
into gold, and I attacked the problem with passion. It seemed
to me the ideal industry. There was a constant demand for the
product. The birds require no care except to be left in peace.
Each one is a simple factory for turning fish into dung. The
digging of the guano is only a question of not spoiling the crop
by digging too much. The sole problem is the cost of the labour.
It was 1942. The simple Cuban and Jamaican labourer was
earning ten shillings a week cutting cane. I tempted a hundred
of them over to the island by paying them twelve shillings a
week. With guano at fifty dollars a ton I was well placed. But
on one condition—that the wages remained constant. I ensured
that by isolating my community from world inflation. Harsh
methods have had to be used from time to time, but the result
is that my men are content with their wages because they are
the highest wages they have ever known. I brought in a dozen
Chinese Negroes with their families to act as overseers. They
receive a pound a week per man. They are tough and reliable.
On occasion I had to be ruthless with them, but they soon
learned. Automatically my people increased in numbers. I
added some engineers and some builders. We set to work on
the mountain. Occasionally I brought in teams of specialists
on high wages. They were kept apart from the others. They
lived inside the mountain until their work was done and then
left by ship. They put in the lighting and the ventilation and the
lift. They built this room. Stores and furnishings came in from
all over the world. These people built the sanatorium façade
which will cover my operations in case one day there is a shipwreck
or the Governor of Jamaica decides to pay me a call.”
The lips glazed into a smile. “You must admit that I am able,
if I wish, to accord visitors a most fragrant reception—a wise
precaution for the future! And gradually, methodically, my
fortress was built while the birds defecated on top of it. It has
been hard, Mister Bond.” The black eyes did not look for
sympathy or praise. “But by the end of last year the work was
done. A secure, well-camouflaged base had been achieved. I
was ready to proceed to the next step—an extension of my
power to the outside world.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Doctor No paused. He lifted his arms an inch and dropped
them again resignedly in his lap. “Mister Bond, I said that
there was not a cloud in the sky during all these fourteen years.
But one was there, all the time, below the horizon. And do you
know what it was? It was a bird, a ridiculous bird called a
roseate spoonbill! I will not weary you with the details, Mister
Bond. You are already aware of some of the circumstances.
The two wardens, miles away in the middle of the lake, were
provisioned by launch from Cuba. They sent out their reports
by the launch. Occasionally, ornithologists from America came
by the launch and spent some days at the camp. I did not mind.
The area is out of bounds to my men. The wardens were not
allowed near my compounds. There was no contact. From the
first I made it clear to the Audubon Society that I would not
meet their representatives. And then what happens? One day,
out of a clear sky, I get a letter by the monthly boat. The
roseate spoonbills have become one of the bird wonders of the
world. The Society gives me formal notification that they
intend to build a hotel on their leasehold, near the river up
which you came. Bird lovers from all over the world will come
to observe the birds. Films will be taken. Crab Key, they
told me in their flattering, persuasive letter, would become
famous.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Mister Bond,” the arms were raised and dropped back.
Irony gathered at the edges of the set smile. “Can you believe
it? This privacy I had achieved! The plans I had for the future!
To be swept aside because of a lot of old women and their
birds! I examined the lease. I wrote offering a huge sum to
buy it. They refused. So I studied these birds. I found out
about their habits. And suddenly the solution was there. And
it was easy. Man had always been the worst predator on these
birds. Spoonbills are extremely shy. They frighten easily. I sent
to Florida for a marsh buggy—the vehicle that is used for oil
prospecting, that will cover any kind of terrain. I adapted it to
frighten and to burn—not only birds, but humans as well, for
the wardens would have to go too. And, one night in December,
my marsh buggy howled off across the lake. It smashed
the camp, both wardens were reported killed—though one, it
turned out, escaped to die in Jamaica—it burned the nesting
places, it spread terror among the birds. Complete success!
Hysteria spread among the spoonbills. They died in thousands.
But then I get a demand for a plane to land on my airstrip.
There was to be an investigation. I decide to agree. It seemed
wiser. An accident is arranged. A lorry goes out of control
down the airstrip as the plane is coming in. The plane is
destroyed. All signs of the lorry are removed. The bodies are
reverently placed in coffins and I report the tragedy. As I
expected, there is further investigation. A destroyer arrives. I
receive the captain courteously. He and his officers are brought
round by sea and then led inland. They are shown the remains
of the camp. My men suggest that the wardens went mad with
loneliness and fought each other. The survivor set fire to the
camp and escaped in his fishing canoe. The airstrip is examined.
My men report that the plane was coming in too fast. The
tyres must have burst on impact. The bodies are handed over.
It is very sad. The officers are satisfied. The ship leaves.
Peace reigns again.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Doctor No coughed delicately. He looked from Bond to the
girl and back again, “And that, my friends, is my story—or
rather the first chapter of what I am confident will be a long
and interesting tale. Privacy has been re-established. There are
now no roseate spoonbills, so there will be no wardens. No
doubt the Audubon Society will decide to accept my offer for
the rest of their lease. No matter. If they start their puny
operations again, other misfortunes will befall them. This has
been a warning to me. There will be no more interference.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Interesting,” said Bond. “An interesting case history. So
that was why Strangways had to be removed. What did you
do with him and his girl?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“They are at the bottom of the Mona Reservoir. I sent three
of my best men. I have a small but efficient machine in Jamaica.
I need it. I have established a watch on the intelligence services
in Jamaica and Cuba. It is necessary for my further operations.
Your Mister Strangways became suspicious and started
ferreting about. Fortunately, by this time, the routines of this
man were known to me. His death and the girl’s were a simple
matter of timing. I had hoped to deal with you with similar
expedition. You were fortunate. But I knew what type of a
man you were from the files at King’s House. I guessed that
the fly would come to the spider. I was ready for you, and when
the canoe showed up on the radar screen I knew you would not
get away.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “Your radar is not very efficient. There were two
canoes. The one you saw was the girl’s. I tell you she had
nothing to do with me.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Then she is unfortunate. I happen to be needing a white
woman for a small experiment. As we agreed earlier, Mister
Bond, one generally gets what one wants.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked thoughtfully at Doctor No. He wondered if it
was worth while even trying to make a dent in this impregnable
man. Was it worth wasting breath by threatening or bluffing?
Bond had nothing but a miserable two of clubs up his sleeve.
The thought of playing it almost bored him. Casually, indifferently
he threw it down.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Then you’re out of luck, Doctor No. You are now a file
in London. My thoughts on this case, the evidence of the
poisoned fruit and the centipede and the crashed motor car,
are on record. So are the names of Miss Chung and Miss Taro.
Instructions were left with someone in Jamaica that my report
should be opened and acted upon if I failed to return from
Crab Key within three days.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond paused. The face of Doctor No was impassive.
Neither the eyes nor the mouth had flickered. The jugular
vein throbbed evenly. Bond bent forward. He said softly, “But
because of the girl, and only because of her, Doctor No, I will
strike a bargain. In exchange for our safe return to Jamaica,
you may have a week’s start. You may take your aeroplane and
your packet of stamps and try to get away.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat back. “Any interest, Doctor No?”</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_16">XVI<br class="lgl"/> HORIZONS OF AGONY</h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">A</span> <span class="sc">voice behind</span> Bond said quietly, “Dinner is served.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond swung round. It was the bodyguard. Beside him
was another man who might have been his twin. They stood
there, two stocky barrels of muscle, their hands buried in
the sleeves of their kimonos, and looked over Bond’s head at
Doctor No.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Ah, nine o’clock already.” Doctor No rose slowly to his
feet. “Come along. We can continue our conversation in more
intimate surroundings. It is kind of you both to have listened
to me with such exemplary patience. I hope the modesty of
my cuisine and my cellar will not prove a further imposition.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Double doors stood open in the wall behind the two white-jacketed
men. Bond and the girl followed Doctor No through
into a small octagonal mahogany panelled room lit by a central
chandelier in silver with storm glasses round the candles. Beneath
it was a round mahogany table laid for three. Silver and
glass twinkled warmly. The plain dark blue carpet was luxuriously
deep. Doctor No took the centre high-backed chair and
bowed the girl into the chair on his right. They sat down
and unfolded napkins of white silk.</p>

<p class="pindent">The hollow ceremony and the charming room maddened
Bond. He longed to break it up with his own hands—to wind
his silk napkin round Doctor No’s throat and squeeze until
the contact lenses popped out of the black, damnable eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">The two guards wore white cotton gloves. They served the
food with a suave efficiency that was prompted by an occasional
word in Chinese from Doctor No.</p>

<p class="pindent">At first, Doctor No seemed preoccupied. He slowly ate
through three bowls of different soup, feeding himself with a
spoon with a short handle that fitted neatly between the
pincers. Bond concentrated on hiding his fears from the girl.
He sat relaxed and ate and drank with a forced good appetite.
He talked cheerfully to the girl about Jamaica—about the birds
and the animals and the flowers which were an easy topic for
her. Occasionally his feet felt for hers under the table. She
became almost gay. Bond thought they were putting on an
excellent imitation of an engaged couple being given dinner by
a detested uncle.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had no idea if his thin bluff had worked. He didn’t
give much for their chances. Doctor No, and Doctor No’s story,
exuded impregnability. The incredible biography rang true.
Not a word of it was impossible. Perhaps there were other
people in the world with their private kingdoms—away from
the beaten track, where there were no witnesses, where they
could do what they liked. And what did Doctor No plan to do
next, after he had squashed the flies that had come to annoy
him? And if—when—he killed Bond and the girl, would
London pick up the threads that Bond had picked up? Probably
they would. There would be Pleydell-Smith. The evidence of
the poisoned fruit. But where would Bond’s replacement get
with Doctor No? Not far. Doctor No would shrug his shoulders
over the disappearance of Bond and Quarrel. Never heard of
them. And there would be no link with the girl. In Morgan’s
Harbour they would think she had been drowned on one of
her expeditions. It was hard to see what could interfere with
Doctor No—with the second chapter of his life, whatever it
was.</p>

<p class="pindent">Underneath his chatter with the girl, Bond prepared for the
worst. There were plenty of weapons beside his plate. When
the cutlets came, perfectly cooked, Bond fiddled indecisively
with the knives and chose the bread knife to eat them with.
While he ate and talked, he edged the big steel meat knife
towards him. An expansive gesture of his right hand knocked
over his glass of champagne and in the split second of the
crash his left hand flicked the knife into the deep sleeve of his
kimono. In the midst of Bond’s apologies and the confusion as
he and the bodyguard mopped up the spilled champagne, Bond
raised his left arm and felt the knife slip back to below his armpit
and then fall inside the kimono against his ribs. When he
had finished his cutlets he tightened the silk belt round his
waist, shifting the knife across his stomach. The knife nestled
comfortingly against his skin and gradually the steel grew
warm.</p>

<p class="pindent">Coffee came and the meal was ended. The two guards came
and stood close behind Bond’s chair and the girl’s. They stood
with their arms crossed on their chests, impassive, motionless,
like executioners.</p>

<p class="pindent">Doctor No put his cup softly down on his saucer. He laid his
two steel claws down on the table in front of him. He sat a
fraction more upright. He turned his body an inch in Bond’s
direction. Now there was no preoccupation in his face. The
eyes were hard, and direct. The thin mouth creased and opened.
“You have enjoyed your dinner, Mister Bond?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took a cigarette from the silver box in front of him
and lit it. He played with the silver table-lighter. He smelled
bad news coming. He must somehow pocket the lighter. Fire
might perhaps be another weapon. He said easily, “Yes. It
was excellent.” He looked across at the girl. He leant forward
in his chair and rested his forearms on the table. He crossed
them, enveloping the lighter. He smiled at her. “I hope I
ordered what you like.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh yes, it was lovely.” For her the party was still going on.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smoked busily, agitating his hands and forearms
to create an atmosphere of movement. He turned to Doctor
No. He stubbed out his cigarette and sat back in his chair.
He folded his arms across his chest. The lighter was in his
left armpit. He smiled cheerfully. “And what happens now,
Doctor No?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“We can proceed to our after-dinner entertainment, Mister
Bond.” The thin smile creased and vanished. “I have examined
your proposition from every angle. I do not accept it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shrugged his shoulders. “You are unwise.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No, Mister Bond. I suspect that your proposition is a gold
brick. People in your trade do not behave as you suggest. They
make routine reports to their headquarters. They keep their
chief aware of the progress of their investigations. I know these
things. Secret agents do not behave as you suggest you have
done. You have been reading too many novels of suspense.
Your little speech reeked of grease-paint and cardboard. No,
Mister Bond, I do not accept your story. If it is true, I am
prepared to face the consequences. I have too much at stake
to be turned from my path. So the police come, the soldiers
come. Where are a man and a girl? What man and what girl?
I know nothing. Please go away. You are disturbing my
guanera. Where is your evidence? Your search warrant? The
English law is strict, gentlemen. Go home and leave me in
peace with my beloved cormorants. You see, Mister Bond?
And let us even say that the worst comes to the worst. That
one of my agents talks, which is highly improbable (Bond
remembered the fortitude of Miss Chung). What have I to
lose? Two more deaths on the charge sheet. But, Mister Bond,
a man can only be hanged once.” The tall pear-shaped head
shook gently from side to side. “Have you anything else to
say? Any questions to ask? You both have a busy night ahead
of you. Your time is getting short. And I must get my sleep.
The monthly ship is putting in tomorrow and I have the
loading to supervise. I shall have to spend the whole day down
on the quay. Well, Mister Bond?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked across at the girl. She had gone deathly pale.
She was gazing at him, waiting for the miracle he would work.
He looked down at his hands. He examined his nails carefully.
He said, playing for time, “And then what? After your busy
day with the bird dung, what comes next on your programme?
What is the next chapter you think you’re going to write?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond didn’t look up. The deep quiet authoritative voice
came to him as if it was coming down from the night sky.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Ah, yes. You must have been wondering, Mister Bond.
You have the habit of inquiry. It persists even to the last, even
into the shadows. I admire such qualities in a man with only
a few hours to live. So I will tell you. I will turn over the next
page. It will console you. There is more to this place than bird
dung. Your instincts did not betray you.” Doctor No paused for
emphasis. “This island, Mister Bond, is about to be developed
into the most valuable technical intelligence centre in the world.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Really?” Bond kept his eyes bent on his hands.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Doubtless you know that Turks Island, about three hundred
miles from here through the Windward Passage, is the
most important centre for testing the guided missiles of the
United States?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It is an important centre, yes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Perhaps you have read of the rockets that have been going
astray recently? The multi-stage <span class="sc">snark</span>, for instance, that
ended its flight in the forests of Brazil instead of the depths
of the South Atlantic?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You recall that it refused to obey the telemetred instructions
to change its course, even to destroy itself. It developed
a will of its own?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I remember.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“There have been other failures, decisive failures, from the
long list of prototypes—the <span class="sc">zuni</span>, <span class="sc">matador</span>, <span class="sc">petrel</span>, <span class="sc">regulus</span>,
<span class="sc">bomarc</span>—so many names, so many changes, I can’t even
remember them all. Well, Mister Bond,” Doctor No could
not keep a note of pride out of his voice, “it may interest you
to know that the vast majority of those failures have been
caused from Crab Key.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Is that so?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You do not believe me? No matter. Others do. Others who
have seen the complete abandonment of one series, the <span class="sc">mastodon</span>,
because of its recurring navigational errors, its failure to
obey the radio directions from Turks Island. Those others are
the Russians. The Russians are my partners in this venture.
They trained six of my men, Mister Bond. Two of those men
are on watch at this moment, watching the radio frequencies,
the beams on which these weapons travel. There is a million
dollars’ worth of equipment up above us in the rock galleries,
Mister Bond, sending fingers up into the Heavyside Layer,
waiting for the signals, jamming them, countering beams with
other beams. And from time to time a rocket soars up on its
way a hundred, five hundred miles into the Atlantic. And we
track it, as accurately as they are tracking it in the Operations
Room on Turks Island. Then, suddenly, our pulses go out
to the rocket, its brain is confused, it goes mad, it plunges
into the sea, it destroys itself, it roars off at a tangent. Another
test has failed. The operators are blamed, the designers, the
manufacturers. There is panic in the Pentagon. Something
else must be tried, different frequencies, different metals, a
different radio brain. Of course,” Doctor No was fair, “we
too have our difficulties. We track many practice shoots without
being able to get through to the brain of the new rocket.
But then we communicate urgently with Moscow. Yes, they
have even given us a cipher machine with our own frequencies
and routines. And the Russians get thinking. They make
suggestions. We try them out. And then, one day, Mister
Bond, it is like catching the attention of a man in a crowd.
Up in the stratosphere the rocket acknowledges our signal.
We are recognized and we can speak to it and change its mind.”
Doctor No paused. “Do you not find that interesting, Mister
Bond, this little sideline to my business in guano? It is, I
assure you, most profitable. It might be still more so. Perhaps
Communist China will pay more. Who knows? I already have
my feelers out.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond lifted his eyes. He looked thoughtfully at Doctor No.
So he <span class="it">had</span> been right. There <span class="it">had</span> been more, much more, in
all this than met the eye. This was a big game, a game that
explained everything, a game that was certainly, in the international
espionage market, well worth the candle. Well, well!
Now the pieces in the puzzle fell firmly into place. For this
it was certainly worth scaring away a few birds and wiping
out a few people. Privacy? Of course Doctor No would have
to kill him and the girl. Power? This was it. Doctor No had
really got himself into business.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked into the two black holes with a new respect.
He said, “You’ll have to kill a lot more people to keep this
thing in your hands, Doctor No. It’s worth a lot of money.
You’ve got a good property here—a better one than I thought.
People are going to want to cut themselves a piece of this cake.
I wonder who will get to you first and kill you. Those men up
there,” he gestured towards the ceiling, “who were trained in
Moscow? They’re the technicians. I wonder what Moscow is
telling them to do? You wouldn’t know that, would you?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Doctor No said, “You persist in underestimating me, Mister
Bond. You are an obstinate man, and stupider than I had
expected. I am aware of these possibilities. I have taken one
of these men and made him into a private monitor. He has
duplicates of the ciphers and of the cipher machine. He lives
in another part of the mountain. The others think that he died.
He watches on all the routine times. He gives me a second
copy of all the traffic that passes. So far, the signals from
Moscow have been innocent of any sign of conspiracy. I am
thinking of these things constantly, Mister Bond. I take precautions
and I shall take further precautions. As I said, you
underestimate me.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I don’t underestimate you, Doctor No. You’re a very careful
man, but you’ve got too many files open on you. In my line
of business, the same thing applies to me. I know the feeling.
But you’ve got some really bad ones. The Chinese one, for
instance. I wouldn’t like to have that one. The FBI should be
the least painful—robbery and false identity. But do you know
the Russians as well as I do? You’re a ‘best friend’ at the
moment. But the Russians don’t have partners. They’ll want
to take you over—buy you out with a bullet. Then there’s the
file you’ve started with my Service. You really want me to
make that one fatter? I shouldn’t do it if I were you, Doctor
No. They’re a tenacious lot of people in my Service. If anything
happens to me and the girl, you’ll find Crab Key’s a
very small and naked little island.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You cannot play for high stakes without taking risks, Mister
Bond. I accept the dangers and, so far as I can, I have equipped
myself against them. You see, Mister Bond,” the deep voice
held a hint of greed, “I am on the edge of still greater things.
The Chapter Two to which I referred holds the promise of
prizes which no one but a fool would throw away because he
was afraid. I have told you that I can bend the beams on which
these rockets fly, Mister Bond. I can make them change course
and ignore their radio control. What would you say, Mister
Bond, if I could go further? If I could bring them down into
the sea near this island and salvage the secrets of their construction.
At present American destroyers, far out in the South
Atlantic, salvage these missiles when they come to the end of
their fuel and parachute down into the sea. Sometimes the
parachutes fail to open. Sometimes the self-destruction devices
fail to operate. No one on Turks Island would be surprised
if every now and then the prototype of a new series broke
off its flight and came down near Crab Key. To begin with,
at least, it would be put down to mechanical failure. Later,
perhaps, they would discover that other radio signals besides
theirs were guiding their rockets. A jamming war would start.
They would try and locate the origin of the false signals.
Directly I found they were looking for me, I would have one
last fling. Their rockets would go mad. They would land on
Havana, on Kingston. They would turn round and home on
Miami. Even without warheads, Mister Bond, five tons of
metal arriving at a thousand miles an hour can cause plenty
of damage in a crowded town. And then what? There would
be panic, a public outcry. The experiments would have to
cease. The Turks Island base would have to close down. And
how much would Russia pay for that to happen, Mister Bond?
And how much for each of the prototypes I captured for
them? Shall we say ten million dollars for the whole operation?
Twenty million? It would be a priceless victory in the armaments race.
I could name my figure. Don’t you agree, Mister
Bond? And don’t you agree that these considerations make
your arguments and threats seem rather puny?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said nothing. There was nothing to say. Suddenly he
was back in the quiet room high up above Regent’s Park. He
could hear the rain slashing softly against the window and M’s
voice, impatient, sarcastic, saying, “Oh, some damned business
about birds . . . holiday in the sun’ll do you good . . . routine
inquiry.” And he, Bond, had taken a canoe and a fisherman
and a picnic lunch and had gone off—how many days, how
many weeks ago?—‘to have a look’. Well, he had had his look
into Pandora’s Box. He had found out the answers, been told
the secrets—and now? Now he was going to be politely shown
the way to his grave, taking the secrets with him and the waif
he had picked up and dragged along with him on his lunatic
adventure. The bitterness inside Bond came up into his mouth
so that for a moment he thought he was going to retch. He
reached for his champagne and emptied the glass. He said
harshly, “All right, Doctor No. Now let’s get on with the
cabaret. What’s the programme—knife, bullet, poison, rope?
But make it quick, I’ve seen enough of you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Doctor No’s lips compressed into a thin purple line. The
eyes were hard as onyx under the billiard-ball forehead and
skull. The polite mask had gone. The Grand Inquisitor sat in
the high-backed chair. The hour had struck for the <span class="it">peine forte
et dure</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">Doctor No spoke a word and the two guards took a step
forward and held the two victims above the elbows, forcing
their arms back against the sides of their chairs. There was
no resistance. Bond concentrated on holding the lighter in
his armpit. The white-gloved hands on his biceps felt like
steel bands. He smiled across at the girl. “I’m sorry about this,
Honey. I’m afraid we’re not going to be able to play together
after all.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl’s eyes in the pale face were blue-black with fear.
Her lips trembled. She said, “Will it hurt?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Silence!” Doctor No’s voice was the crack of a whip.
“Enough of this foolery. Of course it will hurt. I am interested
in pain. I am also interested in finding out how much the
human body can endure. From time to time I make experiments
on those of my people who have to be punished. And
on trespassers like yourselves. You have both put me to a great
deal of trouble. In exchange I intend to put you to a great deal
of pain. I shall record the length of your endurance. The facts
will be noted. One day my findings will be given to the world.
Your deaths will have served the purposes of science. I never
waste human material. The German experiments on live
humans during the war were of great benefit to science. It is
a year since I put a girl to death in the fashion I have chosen
for you, woman. She was a Negress. She lasted three hours.
She died of terror. I have wanted a white girl for comparison.
I was not surprised when your arrival was reported. I get what
I want.” Doctor No sat back in his chair. His eyes were now
fixed on the girl, watching her reactions. She stared back at
him, half hypnotized, like a bush mouse in front of a rattlesnake.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond set his teeth.</p>

<p class="pindent">“You are a Jamaican, so you will know what I am talking
about. This island is called Crab Key. It is called by that name
because it is infested with crabs, land crabs—what they call in
Jamaica ‘black crabs’. You know them. They weigh about a
pound each and they are as big as saucers. At this time of
year they come up in thousands from their holes near the
shore and climb up towards the mountain. There, in the coral
uplands, they go to ground again in holes in the rock and
spawn their broods. They march up in armies of hundreds at
a time. They march through everything and over everything.
In Jamaica they go through houses that are in their path. They
are like the lemmings of Norway. It is a compulsive migration.”
Doctor No paused. He said softly, “But there is a
difference. The crabs devour what they find in their path. And
at present, woman, they are ‘running’. They are coming up
the mountainside in their tens of thousands, great red and
orange and black waves of them, scuttling and hurrying and
scraping against the rock above us at this moment. And tonight,
in the middle of their path, they are going to find the
naked body of a woman pegged out—a banquet spread for
them—and they will feel the warm body with their feeding
pincers, and one will make the first incision with his fighting
claws and then . . . and then . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a moan from the girl. Her head fell forward
slackly on to her chest. She had fainted. Bond’s body heaved
in his chair. A string of obscenities hissed out between his
clenched teeth. The huge hands of the guard were like fire
round his arms. He couldn’t even move the chair-legs on the
floor. After a moment he desisted. He waited for his voice to
steady, then he said, with all the venom he could put into the
words, “You bastard. You’ll fry in hell for this.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Doctor No smiled thinly. “Mister Bond, I do not admit the
existence of hell. Console yourself. Perhaps they will start at
the throat or the heart. The movement of the pulse will attract
them. Then it will not be long.” He spoke a sentence in
Chinese. The guard behind the girl’s chair leant forward and
plucked her bodily out of the chair as if she had been a child
and slung the inert body over his shoulder. Between the dangling
arms the hair fell down in a golden shower. The guard
went to the door and opened it and went out, closing it noiselessly
behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">For a moment there was silence in the room. Bond thought
only of the knife against his skin and of the lighter under his
armpit. How much damage could he do with the two pieces
of metal? Could he somehow get within range of Doctor No?</p>

<p class="pindent">Doctor No said quietly, “You said that power was an
illusion, Mister Bond. Do you change your mind? My power
to select this particular death for the girl is surely not an
illusion. However, let us proceed to the method of your
departure. That also has its novel aspects. You see, Mister
Bond, I am interested in the anatomy of courage—in the power
of the human body to endure. But how to measure human
endurance? How to plot a graph of the will to survive, the
tolerance of pain, the conquest of fear? I have given much
thought to the problem, and I believe I have solved it. It is, of
course, only a rough and ready method, and I shall learn by
experience as more and more subjects are put to the test. I
have prepared you for the experiment as best I could. I gave
you a sedative so that your body should be rested and I have
fed you well so that you may be at full strength. Future—what
shall I call them—patients, will have the same advantages.
All will start equal in that respect. After that it will be a
question of the individual’s courage and powers of endurance.”
Doctor No paused, watching Bond’s face. “You see, Mister
Bond, I have just finished constructing an obstacle race, an
assault course against death. I will say no more about it
because the element of surprise is one of the constituents of
fear. It is the unknown dangers that are the worst, that bear
most heavily on the reserves of courage. And I flatter myself
that the gauntlet you will run contains a rich assortment of
the unexpected. It will be particularly interesting, Mister Bond,
that a man of your physical qualities is to be my first competitor.
It will be most interesting to observe how far you get
down the course I have devised. You should put up a worthy
target figure for future runners. I have high expectations of
you. You should go far, but when, as is inevitable, you have
finally failed at an obstacle, your body will be recovered and
I shall most meticulously examine the physical state of your
remains. The data will be recorded. You will be the first dot
on a graph. Something of an honour, is it not, Mister Bond?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said nothing. What the hell did all this mean? What
could this test consist of? Would it be possible to survive it?
Could he conceivably escape from it and get to the girl before
it was too late, even if it was only to kill her and save her from
her torture? Silently Bond gathered his reserves of courage,
steeling his mind against the fear of the unknown that already
had him by the throat, focusing his whole will on survival.
Somehow, above all else, he must cling to his weapons.</p>

<p class="pindent">Doctor No rose and stepped away from his chair. He walked
slowly to the door and turned. The menacing black holes
looked back at Bond from just below the lintel of the door.
The head was inclined a fraction. The purple lips creased
back. “Run a good race for me, Mister Bond. My thoughts,
as they say, will be with you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Doctor No turned away and the door closed softly behind
the long thin gunmetal back.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_17">XVII<br class="lgl"/> THE LONG SCREAM</h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="sc">here was</span> a man on the lift. The doors were open, waiting.
James Bond, his arms still locked to his sides, was
marched in. Now the dining-room would be empty. How soon
would the guards go back, start clearing away the dinner,
notice the missing things? The doors hissed shut. The liftman
stood in front of the buttons so that Bond could not see which
he had pressed. They were going up. Bond tried to estimate
the distance. The lift sighed to a stop. The time seemed rather
less than when he had come down with the girl. The doors
opened on to an uncarpeted corridor with rough grey paint
on the stone walls. It ran about twenty yards straight ahead.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Hold it, Joe,” said Bond’s guard to the liftman. “Be right
with you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was marched down the corridor past doors numbered
with letters of the alphabet. There was a faint hum of machinery
in the air and behind one door Bond thought he could catch
the crackle of radio static. It sounded as if they might be in
the engine-room of the mountain. They came to the end door.
It was marked with a black Q. It was ajar and the guard pushed
Bond into the door so that it swung open. Through the door
was a grey painted stone cell about fifteen feet square. There
was nothing in it except a wooden chair on which lay, laundered
and neatly folded, Bond’s black canvas jeans and his blue shirt.</p>

<p class="pindent">The guard let go of Bond’s arms. Bond turned and looked
into the broad yellow face below the crinkly hair. There was a
hint of curiosity and pleasure in the liquid brown eyes. The
man stood holding the door handle. He said, “Well, this is it,
bud. You’re at the starting gate. You can either sit here and
rot or find your way out on to the course. Happy landings.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond thought it was just worth trying. He glanced past the
guard to where the liftman was standing beside his open doors,
watching them. He said softly, “How would you like to
earn ten thousand dollars, guaranteed, and a ticket to anywhere
in the world?” He watched the man’s face. The mouth
spread in a wide grin to show brownish teeth worn to uneven
points by years of chewing sugar-cane.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thanks, Mister. I’d rather stay alive.” The man made to
close the door. Bond whispered urgently, “We could get out
of here together.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The thick lips sneered. The man said, “Shove it!” The door
shut with a solid click.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shrugged his shoulders. He gave the door a cursory
glance. It was made of metal and there was no handle on the
inside. Bond didn’t waste his shoulder on it. He went to the
chair and sat down on the neat pile of his clothes and looked
round the cell. The walls were entirely naked except for a
ventilation grille of thick wire in one corner just below the
ceiling. It was wider than his shoulders. It was obviously the
way out into the assault course. The only other break in the
walls was a thick glass porthole, no bigger than Bond’s head,
just above the door. Light from the corridor filtered through it
into the cell. There was nothing else. It was no good wasting
any more time. It would now be about ten-thirty. Outside,
somewhere on the slope of the mountain, the girl would already
be lying, waiting for the rattle of claws on the grey coral. Bond
clenched his teeth at the thought of the pale body spreadeagled
out there under the stars. Abruptly he stood up. What
the hell was he doing sitting still. Whatever lay on the other
side of the wire grille, it was time to go.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took out his knife and the lighter and threw off the
kimono. He dressed in the trousers and shirt and stowed the
lighter in his hip pocket. He tried the edge of the knife with
his thumb. It was very sharp. It would be better still if he
could get a point on it. He knelt on the floor and began whittling
the rounded end on the stone. After a precious quarter of
an hour he was satisfied. It was no stiletto, but it would serve
to stab as well as cut. Bond put the knife between his teeth
and set the chair below the grille, and climbed on to it. The
grille! Assuming he could tear it off its hinges, the frame of
quarter-inch wire might straighten into a spear. That would
make a third weapon. Bond reached up with crooked fingers.</p>

<p class="pindent">The next thing he knew was a searing pain up his arm and
the crack of his head hitting the stone floor. He lay, stunned,
with only the memory of a blue flash and the hiss and crackle
of electricity to tell him what had hit him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got to his knees and stayed there. He bent his head
down and shook it slowly from side to side like a wounded
animal. He noticed a smell of burning flesh. He lifted his right
hand up to his eyes. There was the red smear of an open burn
across the inside of his fingers. Seeing it brought the pain.
Bond spat out a four-letter word. Slowly he got to his feet.
He squinted up at the wire grille as if it might strike at him
again, like a snake. Grimly he set the chair upright against the
wall. He picked up his knife and cut a strip off the discarded
kimono and tied it firmly across his fingers. Then he climbed
up again on to the chair and looked at the grille. He was meant
to get through it. The shock had been to soften him up—a
taste of pain to come. Surely he had fused the blasted thing.
Surely they would have switched off the current. He looked at
it only for an instant, then the fingers of his left hand crooked
and went straight up to the impersonal wire mesh. His fingers
went through the wire rim and gripped.</p>

<p class="pindent">Nothing! Nothing at all—just wire. Bond grunted. He felt
his nerves slacken. He tugged at the wire. It gave an inch. He
tugged again and it came away in his hand and dangled down
from two strands of copper flex that disappeared into the wall.
Bond pulled the grille loose from the flex and got down from
the chair. Yes, there was a join in the frame. He set to work
unravelling the mesh. Then using the chair as a hammer, he
straightened the heavy wire.</p>

<p class="pindent">After ten minutes, Bond had a crooked spear about four feet
long. One end, where it had originally been cut by the pliers,
was jagged. It would not pierce a man’s clothes, but it would
be good enough for the face and neck. By using all his strength
and the crack at the bottom of the metal door, Bond turned the
blunt end into a clumsy crook. He measured the wire against
his leg. It was too long. He bent it double and slipped the spear
down a trouser-leg. Now it hung from his waistband to just
above the knee. He went back to the chair and climbed up
again and reached, nervously, for the edge of the ventilator
shaft. There was no shock. Bond heaved up and through the
opening and lay on his stomach looking along the shaft.</p>

<p class="pindent">The shaft was about four inches wider than Bond’s shoulders.
It was circular and of polished metal. Bond reached for his
lighter, blessing the inspiration that had made him take it, and
flicked it on. Yes, zinc sheeting that looked new. The shaft
stretched straight ahead, featureless except for the ridges where
the sections of pipe joined. Bond put the lighter back in his
pocket and snaked forward.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was easy going. Cool air from the ventilating system blew
strongly in Bond’s face. The air held no smell of the sea—it
was the canned stuff that comes from an air-conditioning
plant. Doctor No must have adapted one of the shafts to his
purpose. What hazards had he built into it to test out his
victims? They would be ingenious and painful—designed to
reduce the resistance of the victim. At the winning post, so
to speak, there would be the <span class="it">coup de grâce</span>—if the victim ever
got that far. It would be something conclusive, something from
which there would be no escape, for there would be no prizes in
this race except oblivion—an oblivion, thought Bond, he might
be glad to win. Unless of course Doctor No had been just a bit
too clever. Unless he had underestimated the will to survive.
That, thought Bond, was his only hope—to try to survive the
intervening hazards, to get through at least to the last ditch.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a faint luminosity ahead. Bond approached it
carefully, his senses questing in front of him like antennae.
It grew brighter. It was the glint of light against the end of
the lateral shaft. He went on until his head touched the metal.
He twisted over on his back. Straight above him, at the top of
fifty yards or so of vertical shaft, was a steady glimmer. It was
like looking up a long gun barrel. Bond inched round the square
bend and stood upright. So he was supposed to climb straight
up this shining tube of metal without a foothold! Was it
possible? Bond expanded his shoulders. Yes, they gripped the
sides. His feet could also get a temporary purchase, though
they would slip except where the ridges at the joints gave him
an ounce of upward leverage. Bond shrugged his shoulders
and kicked off his shoes. It was no good arguing. He would
just have to try.</p>

<p class="pindent">Six inches at a time, Bond’s body began to worm up the
shaft—expand shoulders to grip the sides, lift feet, lock knees,
force the feet outwards against the metal and, as the feet
slipped downwards with his weight, contract shoulders and
raise them a few inches higher. Do it again, and again and
again and again. Stop at each tiny bulge where the sections
joined and use the millimetre of extra support to get some
breath and measure the next lap. Otherwise don’t look up,
think only of the inches of metal that have to be conquered
one by one. Don’t worry about the glimmer of light that never
grows brighter or nearer. Don’t worry about losing your grip
and falling to smash your ankles at the bottom of the shaft.
Don’t worry about cramp. Don’t worry about your screaming
muscles or the swelling bruises on your shoulders and the
sides of your feet. Just take the silver inches as they come,
one by one, and conquer them.</p>

<p class="pindent">But then the feet began to sweat and slip. Twice Bond lost
a yard before his shoulders, scalding with the friction, could
put on the brake. Finally he had to stop altogether to let his
sweat dry in the downward draught of air. He waited for a
full ten minutes, staring at his faint reflection in the polished
metal, the face split in half by the knife between the teeth.
Still he refused to look up to see how much more there was.
It might be too much to bear. Carefully Bond wiped each foot
against a trouser-leg and began again.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now half Bond’s mind was dreaming while the other half
fought the battle. He wasn’t even conscious of the strengthening
breeze or the slowly brightening light. He saw himself as
a wounded caterpillar crawling up a waste pipe towards the
plug-hole of a bath. What would he see when he got through
the plug-hole? A naked girl drying herself? A man shaving?
Sunlight streaming through an open window into an empty
bathroom?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s head bumped against something. The plug was in
the plug-hole! The shock of disappointment made him slip a
yard before his shoulders got a fresh grip. Then he realized.
He was at the top! Now he noticed the bright light and the
strong wind. Feverishly, but with a more desperate care, he
heaved up again until his head touched. The wind was coming
into his left ear. Cautiously he turned his head. It was another
lateral shaft. Above him light was shining through a thick porthole.
All he had to do was inch himself round and grip the
edge of the new shaft and somehow gather enough strength
to heave himself in. Then he would be able to lie down.</p>

<p class="pindent">With an extra delicacy, born of panic that something might
now go wrong, that he might make a mistake and plummet
back down the shaft to land in a crackle of bone, Bond, his
breath steaming against the metal, carried out the manœuvre
and, with his last ounce of strength, jackknifed into the opening
and crumpled full length on his face.</p>

<p class="pindent">Later—how much later?—Bond’s eyes opened and his body
stirred. The cold had woken him from the fringe of total unconsciousness
into which his body had plunged. Painfully he
rolled over on his back, his feet and shoulders screaming at
him, and lay gathering his wits and summoning more strength.
He had no idea what time it was or whereabouts he was inside
the mountain. He lifted his head and looked back at the porthole
above the yawning tube out of which he had come. The
light was yellowish and the glass looked thick. He remembered
the porthole in Room Q. There had been nothing breakable
about that one, nor, he guessed, would there be here.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly, behind the glass, he saw movement. As he watched,
a pair of eyes materialized from behind the electric light bulb.
They stopped and looked at him, the bulb making a yellow
glass nose between them. They gazed incuriously at him and
then they were gone. Bond’s lips snarled back from his
teeth. So his progress was going to be observed, reported back
to Doctor No!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said out loud, viciously, “—— them all,” and turned
sullenly back on his stomach. He raised his head and looked
forward. The tunnel shimmered away into blackness. Come
on! No good hanging about. He picked up his knife and put
it back between his teeth and winced his way forward.</p>

<p class="pindent">Soon there was no more light. Bond stopped from time to
time and used the lighter, but there was nothing but blackness
ahead. The air began to get warmer in the shaft, and,
perhaps fifty yards further, definitely hot. There was the smell
of heat in the air, metallic heat. Bond began to sweat. Soon
his body was soaked and he had to pause every few minutes
to wipe his eyes. There came a right-hand turn in the shaft.
Round it the metal of the big tube was hot against his skin.
The smell of heat was very strong. There came another right-angled
turn. As soon as Bond’s head got round he quickly
pulled out his lighter and lit it and then snaked back and lay
panting. Bitterly he examined the new hazard, probing it,
cursing it. His light had flickered on discoloured, oyster-hued
zinc. The next hazard was to be heat!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond groaned aloud. How could his bruised flesh stand up
to that? How could he protect his skin from the metal? But
there wasn’t anything he could do about it. He could either
go back, or stay where he was, or go on. There was no other
decision to make, no other shift or excuse. There was one, and
only one, grain of consolation. This would not be heat that
would kill, only maim. This would not be the final killing
ground—only one more test of how much he could take.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond thought of the girl and of what she was going through.
Oh well. Get on with it. Now, let’s see. . . .</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took his knife and cut off the whole front of his shirt
and sliced it into strips. The only hope was to put some wrapping
round the parts of his body that would have to bear the
brunt—his hands and his feet. His knees and elbows would
have to get along with their single covering of cotton fabric.
Wearily he set to work, cursing softly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now he was ready. One, two, three . . .</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned the corner and forged forward into the heat
stench.</p>

<p class="pindent">Keep your naked stomach off the ground! Contract your
shoulders! Hands, knees, toes; hands, knees, toes. Faster,
faster! Keep going fast so that each touch on the ground is
quickly taken over by the next.</p>

<p class="pindent">The knees were getting it worst, taking the bulk of Bond’s
weight. Now the padded hands were beginning to smoulder.
There was a spark, and another one, and then a worm of red
as the sparks began to run. The smoke from the stuff smarted
in Bond’s sweating eyes. God, he couldn’t do any more! There
was no air. His lungs were bursting. Now his two hands shed
sparks as he thrust them forward. The stuff must be nearly
gone. Then the flesh would burn. Bond lurched and his
bruised shoulder hit the metal. He screamed. He went on
screaming, regularly, with each contact of hand or knee or
toes. Now he was finished. Now it was the end. Now he would
fall flat and slowly fry to death. No! He must drive on, screaming,
until his flesh was burned to the bone. The skin must have
already gone from the knees. In a moment the balls of his
hands would meet the metal. Only the sweat running down his
arms could be keeping the pads of stuff damp. Scream, scream,
scream! It helps the pain. It tells you you’re alive. Go on! Go
on! It can’t be much longer. This isn’t where you’re supposed
to die. You are still alive. Don’t give up! You can’t!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s right hand hit something that gave before it. There
was a stream of ice-cold air. His other hand hit, then his head.
There was a tinny noise. Bond felt the lower edge of an
asbestos baffle scrape down his back. He was through. He
heard the baffle bang shut. His hands came up against solid
wall. They quested to left and right. It was a right-angled
bend. His body followed blindly round the corner. The cool
air felt like daggers in his lungs. Gingerly he laid his fingers
down on the metal. It was cold! With a groan Bond fell on
his face and lay still.</p>

<p class="pindent">Sometime later the pain revived him. Bond turned sluggishly
over on his back. Vaguely he noticed the lighted porthole
above him. Vaguely he took in the eyes gazing down on
him. Then he let the black waves take him away again.</p>

<p class="pindent">Slowly, in the darkness, the blisters formed across the skin
and the bruised feet and shoulders stiffened. The sweat dried
on the body and then on the rags of clothing, and the cool air
soaked down into the overheated lungs and began its insidious
work. But the heart beat on, strongly and regularly inside the
tortured envelope, and the healing sorceries of oxygen and rest
pumped life back into the arteries and veins and recharged
the nerves.</p>

<p class="pindent">Years later, Bond awoke. He stirred. As his eyes opened and
met the other pair, inches away behind the glass, pain took
him and shook him like a rat. He waited for the shock to die.
He tried again, and then again, until he had measured the
strength of his adversary. Then Bond, to hide himself away
from the witness, turned over on his stomach and took the full
blast of it. Again he waited, exploring his body for its reactions,
testing the strength of the resolve that was left in the batteries.
How much more could he take now? Bond’s lips drew back
from his teeth and he snarled into the darkness. It was an
animal sound. He had come to the end of his human reactions
to pain and adversity. Doctor No had got him cornered. But
there were animal reserves of desperation left and, in a strong
animal, those reserves are deep.</p>

<p class="pindent">Slowly, agonizingly, Bond snaked a few yards away from the
eyes and then reached for his lighter and lit it. Ahead there
was only the black full moon, the yawning circular mouth that
led into the stomach of death. Bond put back the lighter. He
took a deep breath and got to his hands and knees. The pain
was no greater, only different. Slowly, stiffly, he winced
forward.</p>

<p class="pindent">The cotton fabric at Bond’s knees and elbows had burned
away. Numbly his mind registered the moisture as his blisters
burst against the cool metal. As he moved, he flexed his fingers
and toes, testing the pain. Slowly he got the measure of what
he could do, what hurt most. This pain is supportable, he
argued to himself. If I had been in an aeroplane crash, they
would only diagnose superficial contusions and burns. I would
be out of hospital in a few days. There’s nothing wrong with
me. I’m a survivor from the crash. It hurts, but it’s nothing.
Think of the bits and pieces of the other passengers. Be thankful.
Put it out of your mind. But, nagging behind these reflections,
was the knowledge that he had not yet had the crash—that
he was still on his way towards it, his resistance, his effectiveness
reduced. When would it come? What shape would it
take? How much more was he to be softened up before he
reached the killing ground?</p>

<p class="pindent">Ahead in the darkness the tiny red pinpoints might have
been an hallucination, specks before the eyes as a result of
exhaustion. Bond stopped and screwed up his eyes. He shook
his head. No, they were still there. Slowly he snaked closer.
Now they were moving. Bond stopped again. He listened.
Above the quiet thumping of his heart there was a soft,
delicate rustling. The pinpoints had increased in number.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now there were twenty or thirty, shifting to and fro, some
quickly, some slowly, all over the circle of blackness ahead.
Bond reached for his lighter. He held his breath as he lit the
little yellow flame. The red pinpoints went out. Instead, a
yard ahead of him, very narrow mesh wire, almost as fine as
muslin, blocked the shaft.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond inched forward, the lighter held before him. It was
some sort of a cage with small things living in it. He could hear
them scuttling back, away from the light. A foot away from the
mesh he dowsed the light and waited for his eyes to get used
to the dark. As he waited, listening, he could hear the tiny
scuttling back towards him, and gradually the forest of red
pinpoints gathered again, peering at him through the mesh.</p>

<p class="pindent">What was it? Bond listened to the pounding of his heart.
Snakes? Scorpions? Centipedes?</p>

<p class="pindent">Carefully he brought his eyes close up to the little glowing
forest. He inched the lighter up beside his face and suddenly
pressed the lever. He caught a glimpse of tiny claws hooked
through the mesh and of dozens of thick furry feet and of
furry sacklike stomachs topped by big insect heads that seemed
to be covered with eyes. The things plopped hurriedly off the
wire on to the tin and scurried back and huddled in a grey-brown
furry mass at the end of the cage.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond squinted through the mesh, moving the light back and
forward. Then he dowsed the light, to save fuel, and let the
breath come through his teeth in a quiet sigh.</p>

<p class="pindent">They were spiders, giant tarantulas, three or four inches
long. There were twenty of them in the cage. And somehow
he had to get past them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond lay and rested and thought while the red eyes gathered
again in front of his face.</p>

<p class="pindent">How deadly were these things? How much of the tales about
them were myth? They could certainly kill animals, but how
mortal to men were these giant spiders with the long soft
friendly fur of a borzoi? Bond shuddered. He remembered
the centipede. The touch of the tarantulas would be much
softer. They would be like tiny teddy bears’ paws against one’s
skin—until they bit and emptied their poison sacs into you.</p>

<p class="pindent">But again, would this be Doctor No’s killing ground? A bite
or two perhaps—to send one into a delirium of pain. The
horror of having to burst through the mesh in the darkness—Doctor
No would not have reckoned with Bond’s lighter—and
squash through the forest of eyes, crushing some soft
bodies, but feeling the jaws of the others lance home. And then
more bites from the ones that had caught in the clothing.
And then the creeping agony of the poison. That would have
been the way Doctor No’s mind would have worked—to send
one screaming on one’s way. To what? To the final fence?</p>

<p class="pindent">But Bond had the lighter and the knife and the wire spear.
All he needed was the nerve, and infinite, infinite precision.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond softly opened the jaws of the lighter and pulled the
wick out an inch with his thumb and fingernail to give a bigger
flame. He lit it and, as the spiders scuttled back, he pierced
the thin wire mesh with his knife. He made a hole near the
frame and cut down sideways and round. Then he seized the
flap of wire and wrenched it out of the frame. It tore like stiff
calico and came away in one piece. He put the knife back
between his teeth and snaked through the opening. The spiders
cowered before the flame of the lighter and crowded back on
top of each other. Bond slid the wire spear out of his trousers
and jabbed the blunt, doubled wire into the middle of them.
He jabbed again and again, fiercely pulping the bodies. When
some of the spiders tried to escape towards him he waved the
light at them and smashed the fugitives one by one. Now the
living spiders were attacking the dead and wounded and all
Bond had to do was bash and bash into the writhing, sickening
mess of blood and fur.</p>

<p class="pindent">Slowly all movement slackened and then ceased. Were they
all dead? Were some shamming? The flame of the lighter was
beginning to die. He would have to chance it. Bond reached
forward and shovelled the dead mess to one side. Then he took
his knife from between his teeth and reached out and slashed
open the second curtain of wire, bending the flap down over
the heap of pulped bodies. The light flickered and became a
red glow. Bond gathered himself and shot his body over the
bloody pile of corpses and through the jagged frame.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had no idea what bits of metal he touched or whether
he had put his knee or his foot among the spiders. All he knew
was that he had got through. He heaved himself yards on
along the shaft and stopped to gather his breath and his nerve.</p>

<p class="pindent">Above him a dim light came on. Bond squinted sideways
and upwards, knowing what he would see. The slanting yellow
eyes behind the thick glass looked keenly down at him. Slowly,
behind the bulb, the head moved from side to side. The eyelids
dropped in mock pity. A closed fist, the thumb pointing downwards
in farewell and dismissal, inserted itself between the
bulb and the glass. Then it was withdrawn. The light went
out. Bond turned his face back to the floor of the shaft and
rested his forehead on the cool metal. The gesture said that he
was coming into the last lap, that the observers had finished
with him until they came for his remains. It took an extra
ounce of heart out of Bond that there had been no gesture of
praise, however small, that he had managed to survive so far.
These Chigroes hated him. They only wanted him to die,
and as miserably as possible.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s teeth ground softly together. He thought of the girl
and the thought gave him strength. He wasn’t dead yet.
Damn it, he wouldn’t die! Not until the heart was torn from
his body.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond tensed his muscles. It was time to go. With extra care
he put his weapons back in their places and painfully began
to drag himself on into the blackness.</p>

<p class="pindent">The shaft was beginning to slope gently downwards. It
made the going easier. Soon the slope grew steeper so that
Bond could almost slide along under the momentum of his
weight. It was a blessed relief not to have to make the effort
with his muscles. There was a glimmer of grey light ahead,
nothing more than a lessening of the darkness, but it was a
change. The quality of the air seemed to be different. There
was a new, fresh smell to it. What was it? The sea?</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly Bond realized that he was slipping down the shaft.
He opened his shoulders and spread his feet to slow himself.
It hurt and the braking effect was small. Now the shaft was
widening. He could no longer get a grip! He was going faster
and faster. A bend was just ahead. And it was a bend downwards!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s body crashed into the bend and round it. Christ, he
was diving head downwards! Desperately Bond spread his feet
and hands. The metal flayed his skin. He was out of control,
diving down a gun barrel. Far below there was a circle
of grey light. The open air? The sea? The light was tearing
up at him. He fought for breath. Stay alive, you fool! Stay
alive!</p>

<p class="pindent">Head first, Bond’s body shot out of the shaft and fell through
the air, slowly, slowly, down towards the gunmetal sea that
waited for him a hundred feet below.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_18">XVIII<br class="lgl"/> KILLING GROUND</h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="sc">ond’s body</span> shattered the mirror of the dawn sea like a
bomb.</p>

<p class="pindent">As he had hurtled down the silver shaft towards the widening
disc of light, instinct had told him to get his knife from between
his teeth, to get his hands forward to break his fall, and to keep
his head down and his body rigid. And, at the last fraction of a
second when he glimpsed the up-rushing sea, he had managed
to take a gulp of breath. So Bond hit the water in the semblance
of a dive, his outstretched clenched fists cleaving a hole for his
skull and shoulders, and though, by the time he had shot
twenty feet below the surface, he had lost consciousness, the
forty-mile-an-hour impact with the water failed to smash him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Slowly the body rose to the surface and lay, head down,
softly rocking in the ripples of the dive. The water-choked
lungs somehow contrived to send a last message to the brain.
The legs and arms thrashed clumsily. The head turned up,
water pouring from its open mouth. It sank. Again the legs
jerked, instinctively trying to get the body upright in the water.
This time, coughing horribly, the head jerked above the surface
and stayed there. The arms and legs began to move feebly,
paddling like a dog, and, through the red and black curtain,
the bloodshot eyes saw the lifeline and told the sluggish brain
to make for it.</p>

<p class="pindent">The killing ground was a narrow deep-water inlet at the base
of the towering cliff. The lifeline towards which Bond struggled,
hampered by the clumsy spear in his trouser-leg, was a strong
wire fence, stretched from the rock walls of the inlet and
caging it off from the open sea. The two-feet squares of thick
wire were suspended from a cable six feet above the surface
and disappeared, algae encrusted, into the depths.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got to the wire and hung, crucified. For fifteen
minutes he stayed like that, his body occasionally racked with
vomiting, until he felt strong enough to turn his head and see
where he was. Blearily his eyes took in the towering cliffs
above him and the narrow vee of softly breathing water. The
place was in deep grey shadow, cut off from the dawn by the
mountain, but out at sea there was the pearly iridescence of
first light that meant that for the rest of the world the day
was dawning. Here it was dark and gloomy and brooding.</p>

<p class="pindent">Sluggishly Bond’s mind puzzled over the wire fence. What
was its purpose, closing off this dark cleft of sea? Was it to keep
things out, or keep them in? Bond gazed vaguely down into the
black depths around him. The wire strands vanished into
nothingness below his clinging feet. There were small fish
round his legs below the waist. What were they doing? They
seemed to be feeding, darting in towards him and then backing
away, catching at black strands. Strands of what? Of cotton
from his rags? Bond shook his head to clear it. He looked again.
No, they were feeding off his blood.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shivered. Yes, blood was seeping off his body, off the
torn shoulders, the knees, the feet, into the water. Now for
the first time he felt the pain of the sea water on his sores and
burns. The pain revived him, quickened his mind. If these
small fish liked it, what about barracuda and shark? Was that
what the wire fence was for, to keep man-eating fish from
escaping to sea? Then why hadn’t they been after him already?
To hell with it! The first thing was to crawl up the wire and
get over to the other side. To put the fence between him and
whatever lived in this black aquarium.</p>

<p class="pindent">Weakly, foothold by foothold, Bond climbed up the wire and
over the top and down again to where he could rest well above
the water. He hooked the thick cable under his arms and hung,
a bit of washing on a line, and gazed vaguely down at the fish
that still fed from the blood that dripped off his feet.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now there was nothing much left of Bond, not many
reserves. The last dive down the tube, the crash of impact
and the half-death from drowning had squeezed him like a
sponge. He was on the verge of surrender, on the verge of
giving one small sigh and then slipping back into the soft
arms of the water. How beautiful it would be to give in at
last and rest—to feel the sea softly take him to its bed and
turn out the light.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was the explosive flight of the fish from their feeding
ground that shook Bond out of his death-dreaming. Something
had moved far below the surface. There was a distant
shimmer. Something was coming slowly up on the landward
side of the fence.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s body tautened. His hanging jaw slowly shut and the
slackness cleared from his eyes. With the electric shock of
danger, life flooded back into him, driving out the lethargy,
pumping back the will to survive.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond uncramped the fingers that, a long time ago, his brain
had ordered not to lose his knife. He flexed his fingers and took
a fresh grip of the silver-plated handle. He reached down and
touched the crook of the wire spear that still hung inside his
trouser-leg. He shook his head sharply and focused his eyes.
Now what?</p>

<p class="pindent">Below him the water quivered. Something was stirring
in the depths, something huge. A great length of luminescent
greyness showed, poised far down in the darkness. Something
snaked up from it, a whiplash as thick as Bond’s arm. The tip
of the thong was swollen to a narrow oval, with regular bud-like
markings. It swirled through the water where the fish had
been and was withdrawn. Now there was nothing but the huge
grey shadow. What was it doing? Was it . . . ? Was it tasting
the blood?</p>

<p class="pindent">As if in answer, two eyes as big as footballs slowly swam up
and into Bond’s vision. They stopped, twenty feet below his
own, and stared up through the quiet water at his face.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s skin crawled on his back. Softly, wearily, his mouth
uttered one bitter four-lettered word. So this was the last surprise
of Doctor No, the end of the race!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stared down, half hypnotized, into the wavering pools
of eye far below. So this was the giant squid, the mythical
kraken that could pull ships beneath the waves, the fifty-foot-long
monster that battled with whales, that weighed a ton or
more. What else did he know about them? That they had two
long seizing tentacles and ten holding ones. That they had a
huge blunt beak beneath eyes that were the only fishes’ eyes
that worked on the camera principle, like a man’s. That their
brains were efficient, that they could shoot backwards through
the water at thirty knots, by jet-propulsion. That explosive
harpoons burst in their jellied mantle without damaging them.
That . . . but the bulging black and white targets of the eyes
were rising up towards him. The surface of the water shivered.
Now Bond could see the forest of tentacles that flowered out
of the face of the thing. They were weaving in front of the eyes
like a bunch of thick snakes. Bond could see the dots of the
suckers on their undersides. Behind the head, the great flap
of the mantle softly opened and closed, and behind that the
jellied sheen of the body disappeared into the depths. God,
the thing was as big as a railway engine!</p>

<p class="pindent">Softly, discreetly, Bond snaked his feet and then his arms
through the squares in the wire, lacing himself into them,
anchoring himself so that the tentacles would have either to
tear him to bits or wrench down the wire barrier with him.
He squinted to right and left. Either way it was twenty yards
along the wire to the land. And movement, even if he was
capable of it, would be fatal. He must stay dead quiet and
pray that the thing would lose interest. If it didn’t . . . Softly
Bond’s fingers clenched on the puny knife.</p>

<p class="pindent">The eyes watched him, coldly, patiently. Delicately, like the
questing trunk of an elephant, one of the long seizing tentacles
broke the surface and palped its way up the wire towards his
leg. It reached his foot. Bond felt the hard kiss of the suckers.
He didn’t move. He dared not reach down and lose the grip of
his arms through the wire. Softly the suckers tugged, testing
the amount of yield. It was not enough. Like a huge slimy
caterpillar, the tentacle walked slowly on up the leg. It got to
the bloody blistered kneecap and stopped there, interested.
Bond’s teeth gritted with the pain. He could imagine the message
going back down the thick tentacle to the brain: Yes, it’s
good to eat! And the brain signalling back: then get it! Bring
it to me!</p>

<p class="pindent">The suckers walked on up the thigh. The tip of the tentacle
was pointed, then it splayed out so that it almost covered the
width of Bond’s thigh and then tapered off to a wrist. That
was Bond’s target. He would just have to take the pain and
the horror and wait for the wrist to come within range.</p>

<p class="pindent">A breeze, the first soft breeze of early morning, whispered
across the metal surface of the inlet. It raised small waves that
slapped gently against the sheer walls of the cliff. A wedge of
cormorants took off from the guanera, five hundred feet above
the inlet, and, cackling softly, made out to sea. As they swept
over, the noise that had disturbed them reached Bond—the
triple blast of a ship’s siren that means it is ready to take on
cargo. It came from Bond’s left. The jetty must be round the
corner from the northern arm of the inlet. The tanker from
Antwerp had come in. Antwerp! Part of the world outside—the
world that was a million miles away, out of Bond’s reach—surely
out of his reach for ever. Just around that corner, men
would be in the galley, having breakfast. The radio would
be playing. There would be the sizzle of bacon and eggs, the
smell of coffee . . . breakfast cooking. . . .</p>

<p class="pindent">The suckers were at his hip. Bond could see into the horny
cups. A stagnant sea smell reached him as the hand slowly
undulated upwards. How tough was the mottled grey-brown
jelly behind the hand? Should he stab? No, it must be a quick
hard slash, straight across, like cutting a rope. Never mind
about cutting into his own skin.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now! Bond took a quick glance into the two football eyes,
so patient, so incurious. As he did so the other seizing arm
broke the surface and shot straight up at his face. Bond jerked
back and the hand curled into a fist round the wire in front
of his eyes. In a second it would shift to an arm or shoulder
and he would be finished. Now!</p>

<p class="pindent">The first hand was on his ribs. Almost without taking aim,
Bond’s knife-hand slashed down and across. He felt the blade
bite into the puddingy flesh and then the knife was almost torn
from his grip as the wounded tentacle whipped back into the
water. For a moment the sea boiled around him. Now the other
hand let go the wire and slapped across his stomach. The
pointed hand stuck like a leech, all the power of the suckers
furiously applied. Bond screamed as the suckers bit into his
flesh. He slashed madly, again and again. God, his stomach
was being torn out! The wire shook with the struggle. Below
him the water boiled and foamed. He would have to give in.
One more stab, this time into the back of the hand. It worked!
The hand jerked free and snaked down and away leaving
twenty red circles, edged with blood, across his skin.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had not time to worry about them. Now the head
of the squid had broken the surface and the sea was being
thrashed into foam by the great heaving mantle round it. The
eyes were glaring up at him, redly, venomously, and the forest
of feeding arms was at his feet and legs, tearing the cotton
fabric away and flailing back. Bond was being pulled down,
inch by inch. The wire was biting into his armpits. He could
even feel his spine being stretched. If he held on he would be
torn in half. Now the eyes and the great triangular beak were
right out of the water and the beak was reaching up for his
feet. There was one hope, only one!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond thrust his knife between his teeth and his hand dived
for the crook of the wire spear. He tore it out, got it between
his two hands and wrenched the doubled wire almost straight.
He would have to let go with one arm to stoop and get within
range. If he missed, he would be torn to shreds on the fence.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now, before he died of the pain! Now, now!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond let his whole body slip down the ladder of wire and
lunged through and down with all his force.</p>

<p class="pindent">He caught a glimpse of the tip of his spear lancing into the
centre of a black eyeball and then the whole sea erupted up
at him in a fountain of blackness and he fell and hung upside
down by the knees, his head an inch from the surface of the
water.</p>

<p class="pindent">What had happened? Had he gone blind? He could see
nothing. His eyes were stinging and there was a horrible fish
taste in his mouth. But he could feel the wire cutting into the
tendons behind his knees. So he must be alive! Dazedly Bond
let go the spear from his trailing hand and reached up and felt
for the nearest strand of wire. He got a hold and reached up
his other hand and slowly, agonizingly, pulled himself up so
that he was sitting in the fence. Streaks of light came into his
eyes. He wiped a hand across his face. Now he could see. He
gazed at his hand. It was black and sticky. He looked down
at his body. It was covered with black slime, and blackness
stained the sea for twenty yards around. Then Bond realized.
The wounded squid had emptied its ink sac at him.</p>

<p class="pindent">But where was the squid? Would it come back? Bond
searched the sea. Nothing, nothing but the spreading stain of
black. Not a movement. Not a ripple. Then don’t wait! Get
away from here! Get away quick! Wildly Bond looked to right
and left. Left was towards the ship, but also towards Doctor
No. But right was towards nothing. To build the wire fence the
men must have come from the left, from the direction of the
jetty. There would be some sort of a path. Bond reached for
the top cable and frantically began to edge along the swaying
fence towards the rocky headland twenty yards away.</p>

<p class="pindent">The stinking, bleeding, black scarecrow moved its arms and
legs quite automatically. The thinking, feeling apparatus of
Bond was no longer part of his body. It moved alongside his
body, or floated above it, keeping enough contact to pull the
strings that made the puppet work. Bond was like a cut worm,
the two halves of which continue to jerk forward although life
has gone and been replaced by the mock life of nervous impulses.
Only, with Bond, the two halves were not yet dead.
Life was only in abeyance in them. All he needed was an
ounce of hope, an ounce of reassurance that it was still worth
while trying to stay alive.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got to the rock face. Slowly he let himself down to the
bottom rung of wire. He gazed vaguely at the softly heaving
sheen of water. It was black, impenetrable, as deep as the rest.
Should he chance it? He must! He could do nothing until he
had washed off the caking slime and blood, the horrible stale
fish-smell. Moodily, fatalistically, he took off the rags of his
shirt and trousers and hung them on the wire. He looked down
at his brown and white body, striped and pock-marked with
red. On an instinct he felt his pulse. It was slow but regular.
The steady thump of life revived his spirits. What the hell was
he worrying about? He was alive. The wounds and bruises on
his body were nothing—absolutely nothing. They looked ugly,
but nothing was broken. Inside the torn envelope, the machine
was quietly, solidly ticking over. Superficial cuts and abrasions,
bloody memories, deathly exhaustion—these were hurts that
an accident ward would sneer at. Get on, you bastard! Get
moving! Clean yourself and wake up. Count your blessings.
Think of the girl. Think of the man you’ve somehow got to
find and kill. Hang on to life like you’ve hung on to the knife
between your teeth. Stop being sorry for yourself. To hell
with what happened just now. Get down into the water and
wash!</p>

<p class="pindent">Ten minutes later, Bond, his wet rags clinging to his
scrubbed, stinging body and his hair slicked back out of his
eyes, climbed over the top of the headland.</p>

<p class="pindent">Yes, it was as he had guessed. A narrow rocky track, made
by the feet of the workers, led down the other side and round
the bulge of the cliff.</p>

<p class="pindent">From close by came various sounds and echoes. A crane was
working. He could hear the changing beat of its engine. There
were iron ship-noises and the sound of water splashing into the
sea from a bilge pump.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked up at the sky. It was pale blue. Clouds tinged
with golden pink were trailing away towards the horizon. Far
above him the cormorants were wheeling round the guanera.
Soon they would be going off to feed. Perhaps even now they
were watching the scout groups far out at sea locating the fish.
It would be about six o’clock, the dawn of a beautiful day.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond, leaving drops of blood behind him, picked his way
carefully down the track and along the bottom of the shadowed
cliff. Round the bend, the track filtered through a maze of
giant, tumbled boulders. The noises grew louder. Bond crept
softly forward, watching his footholds for loose stones. A voice
called out, startlingly close, “Okay to go?” There was a distant
answer: “Okay.” The crane engine accelerated. A few more
yards. One more boulder. And another. Now!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond flattened himself against the rock and warily inched his
head round the corner.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_19">XIX<br class="lgl"/> A SHOWER OF DEATH</h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="sc">ond took</span> one long comprehensive look and pulled back.
He leant against the cool face of rock and waited for his
breathing to get back to normal. He lifted his knife close up to
his eyes and carefully examined the blade. Satisfied, he slipped
it behind him and down the waistband of his trousers up
against his spine. There it would be handy but protected from
hitting against anything. He wondered about the lighter. He
took it out of his hip pocket. As a hunk of metal it might be
useful, but it wouldn’t light any more and it might scrape
against the rock. He put it down on the ground away from his
feet.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then Bond sat down and meticulously went over the photograph
that was in his brain.</p>

<p class="pindent">Round the corner, not more than ten yards away, was the
crane. There was no back to the cabin. Inside it a man sat at
the controls. It was the Chinese Negro boss, the driver of the
marsh buggy. In front of him the jetty ran twenty yards out
into the sea and ended in a T. An aged tanker of around ten
thousand tons deadweight was secured alongside the top of
the T. It stood well out of the water, its deck perhaps twelve
feet above the quay. The tanker was called <span class="it">Blanche</span>, and the
<span class="it">Ant</span> of Antwerp showed at her stern. There was no sign of life
on board except one figure lolling at the wheel in the enclosed
bridge. The rest of the crew would be below, battened away
from the guano dust. From just to the right of the crane, an
overhead conveyor-belt in a corrugated-iron housing ran out
from the cliff-face. It was carried on high stanchions above the
jetty and stopped just short of the hold of the tanker. Its mouth
ended in a huge canvas sock, perhaps six feet in diameter.
The purpose of the crane was to lift the wireframed mouth of
the sock so that it hung directly over the hold of the tanker and
to move it to right or left to give even distribution. From out of
the mouth of the sock, in a solid downward jet, the scrambled-egg-coloured
guano dust was pouring into the hold of the
tanker at a rate of tons a minute.</p>

<p class="pindent">Below, on the jetty, to the left and to leeward of the drifting
smoke of the guano dust, stood the tall, watchful figure of
Doctor No.</p>

<p class="pindent">That was all. The morning breeze feathered the deep-water
anchorage, still half in shadow beneath the towering cliffs, the
conveyor-belt thudded quietly on its rollers, the crane’s engine
chuffed rhythmically. There was no other sound, no other
movement, no other life apart from the watch at the ship’s
wheel, the trusty working at the crane, and Doctor No, seeing
that all went well. On the other side of the mountain men would
be working, feeding the guano to the conveyor-belt that
rumbled away through the bowels of the rock, but on this side
no one was allowed and no one was necessary. Apart from
aiming the canvas mouth of the conveyor, there was nothing
else for anyone to do.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat and thought, measuring distances, guessing at
angles, remembering exactly where the crane driver’s hands
and feet were on the levers and the pedals. Slowly, a thin,
hard smile broke across the haggard, sunburned face. Yes! It
was on! It could be done. But softly, gently, slowly! The prize
was almost intolerably sweet.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond examined the soles of his feet and his hands. They
would serve. They would have to serve. He reached back and
felt the handle of the knife. Shifted it an inch. He stood up and
took several slow deep breaths, ran his hands through his salt- and
sweat-matted hair, rubbed them harshly up and down his
face and then down the tattered sides of his black jeans. He
gave a final flex to his fingers. He was ready.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stepped up to the rock and inched an eye round.
Nothing had changed. His guess at the distances had been
right. The crane driver was watchful, absorbed. The neck
above the open khaki shirt was naked, offered, waiting.
Twenty yards away, Doctor No, also with his back to Bond,
stood sentry over the thick rich cataract of whity-yellow dust.
On the bridge, the watch was lighting a cigarette.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked along the ten yards of path that led past the
back of the crane. He picked out the places he would put each
foot. Then he came out from behind the rock and ran.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond ran to the right of the crane, to a point he had chosen
where the lateral side of the cabin would hide him from the
driver and the jetty. He got there and stopped, crouching,
listening. The engine hurried on, the conveyor-belt rumbled
steadily out of the mountain above and behind him. There was
no change.</p>

<p class="pindent">The two iron footholds at the back of the cabin, inches away
from Bond’s face, looked solid. Anyway the noise of the engine
would drown small sounds. But he would have to be quick to
yank the man’s body out of the seat and get his own hands and
feet on the controls. The single stroke of the knife would have
to be mortal. Bond felt along his own collarbone, felt the soft
triangle of skin beneath which the jugular pumped, remembered
the angle of approach behind the man’s back, reminded himself
to force the blade and hold it in.</p>

<p class="pindent">For a final second he listened, then he reached behind his
back for the knife and went up the iron steps and into the
cabin with the stealth and speed of a panther.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the last moment there was need to hurry. Bond stood
behind the man’s back, smelling him. He had time to raise his
knife-hand almost to the roof of the cabin, time to summon
every ounce of strength, before he swept the blade down and
into the square inch of smooth, brownish-yellow skin.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man’s hands and legs splayed away from the controls.
His face strained back towards Bond. It seemed to Bond that
there was a flash of recognition in the bulging eyes before the
whites rolled upwards. Then a strangled noise came from the
open mouth and the big body rolled sideways off its iron seat
and crashed to the floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s eyes didn’t even follow it as far as the ground. He
was already in the seat and reaching for the pedals and levers.
Everything was out of control. The engine was running in
neutral, the wire hawser was tearing off the drum, the tip of
the crane was bending slowly forwards like a giraffe’s neck, the
canvas mouth of the conveyor-belt had wilted and was now
pouring its column of dust between the jetty and the ship.
Doctor No was staring upwards. His mouth was open. Perhaps
he was shouting something.</p>

<p class="pindent">Coolly, Bond reined the machine in, slowly easing the levers
and pedals back to the angles at which the driver had been
holding them. The engine accelerated, the gears bit and began
to work again. The hawser slowed on the spinning drum and
reversed, bringing the canvas mouth up and over the ship. The
tip of the crane lifted and stopped. The scene was as before.
Now!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond reached forward for the iron wheel which the driver
had been handling when Bond had caught his first glimpse
of him. Which way to turn it? Bond tried to the left. The tip
of the crane veered slightly to the right. So be it. Bond spun
the wheel to the right. Yes, by God, it was answering, moving
across the sky, carrying the mouth of the conveyor with it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s eyes flashed to the jetty. Doctor No had moved. He
had moved a few paces to a stanchion that Bond had missed.
He had a telephone in his hand. He was getting through to the
other side of the mountain. Bond could see his hand frantically
jiggling the receiver arm, trying to attract attention.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond whirled the director wheel. Christ, wouldn’t it turn
any faster? In seconds Doctor No would get through and it
would be too late. Slowly the tip of the crane arced across the
sky. Now the mouth of the conveyor was spewing the dust
column down over the side of the ship. Now the yellow mound
was marching silently across the jetty. Five yards, four, three,
two! Don’t look round, you bastard! Arrh, got you! Stop the
wheel! Now, <span class="it">you</span> take it, Doctor No!</p>

<p class="pindent">At the first brush of the stinking dust column, Doctor No
had turned. Bond saw the long arms fling wide as if to embrace
the thudding mass. One knee rose to run. The mouth opened
and a thin scream came up to Bond above the noise of the
engine. Then there was a brief glimpse of a kind of dancing
snowman. And then only a mound of yellow bird dung that
grew higher and higher.</p>

<p class="pindent">“God!” Bond’s voice gave back an iron echo from the walls of
the cabin. He thought of the screaming lungs stuffing with the
filthy dust, the body bending and then falling under the weight,
the last impotent kick of the heels, the last flash of thought—rage,
horror, defeat?—and then the silence of the stinking tomb.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now the yellow mountain was twenty feet high. The stuff
was spilling off the sides of the jetty into the sea. Bond glanced
at the ship. As he did so, there came three blasts on its siren.
The noise crashed round the cliffs. There came a fourth blast
which didn’t stop. Bond could see the watch holding on to the
lanyard as he craned out of the bridge window, looking down.
Bond took his hands off the controls and let them rip. It was
time to go.</p>

<p class="pindent">He slipped off the iron seat and bent over the dead body.
He took the revolver out of the holster and looked at it. He
smiled grimly—Smith &amp; Wesson .38, the regular model.
He slipped it down inside his waistband. It was fine to feel
the heavy cold metal against his skin. He went to the door of
the cabin and dropped down to the ground.</p>

<p class="pindent">An iron ladder ran up the cliff behind the crane to where the
conveyor-housing jutted out. There was a small door in the
corrugated iron wall of the housing. Bond scrambled up
the ladder. The door opened easily, letting out a puff of guano
dust, and he clambered through.</p>

<p class="pindent">Inside, the clanking of the conveyor-belt over its rollers was
deafening, but there were dim inspection lights in the stone
ceiling of the tunnel and a narrow catwalk that stretched away
into the mountain alongside the hurrying river of dust. Bond
moved quickly along it, breathing shallowly against the fishy
ammoniac smell. At all costs he must get to the end before the
significance of the ship’s siren and of the unanswered telephone
overcame the fear of the guards.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond half ran and half stumbled through the echoing stinking
tunnel. How far would it be? Two hundred yards? And
then what? Nothing for it but to break out of the tunnel
mouth and start shooting—cause a panic and hope for the best.
He would get hold of one of the men and wring out of him
where the girl was. Then what? When he got to the place on
the mountainside, what would he find? What would be left of
her?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond ran on faster, his head down, watching the narrow
breadth of planking, wondering what would happen if he
missed his footing and slipped into the rushing river of guano
dust. Would he be able to get off the belt again or would he
be whirled away and down until he was finally spewed out on
to the burial mound of Doctor No?</p>

<p class="pindent">When Bond’s head hit into the soft stomach and he felt the
hands at his throat, it was too late to think of his revolver. His
only reaction was to throw himself down and forward at the
legs. The legs gave against his shoulder and there was a shrill
scream as the body crashed down on his back.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had started the heave that would hurl his attacker
sideways and on to the conveyor-belt when the quality of the
scream and something light and soft about the impact of the
body froze his muscles.</p>

<p class="pindent">It couldn’t be!</p>

<p class="pindent">As if in answer, sharp teeth bit deeply into the calf of his
right leg and an elbow jabbed viciously, knowledgeably, backwards
into his groin.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond yelled with the pain. He tried to squirm sideways to
protect himself, but even as he shouted “Honey!” the elbow
thudded into him again.</p>

<p class="pindent">The breath whistled through Bond’s teeth with the agony.
There was only one way to stop her without throwing her on
to the conveyor-belt. He took a firm grip of one ankle and
heaved himself to his knees. He stood upright, holding her
slung over his shoulder by one leg. The other foot banged
against his head, but half-heartedly, as if she too realized that
something was wrong.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Stop it, Honey! It’s me!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Through the din of the conveyor-belt, Bond’s shout got
through to her. He heard her cry “James!” from somewhere
near the floor. He felt her hands clutch at his legs. “James,
James!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond slowly let her down. He turned and knelt and reached
for her. He put his arms round her and held her tightly to him.
“Oh Honey, Honey. Are you all right?” Desperately, unbelieving,
he strained her to him.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, James! Oh, yes!” He felt her hands at his back and his
hair. “Oh, James, my darling!” she fell against him, sobbing.</p>

<p class="pindent">“It’s all right, Honey.” Bond smoothed her hair. “And
Doctor No’s dead. But now we’ve got to run for it. We’ve got
to get out of here. Come on! How can we get out of the tunnel?
How did you get here? We’ve got to hurry!”</p>

<p class="pindent">As if in comment, the conveyor-belt stopped with a jerk.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond pulled the girl to her feet. She was wearing a dirty
suit of workmen’s blue dungarees. The sleeves and legs were
rolled up. The suit was far too big for her. She looked like a
girl in a man’s pyjamas. She was powdered white with the
guano dust except where the tears had marked her cheeks. She
said breathlessly, “Just up there! There’s a side tunnel that
leads to the machine shops and the garage. Will they come
after us?”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was no time to talk. Bond said urgently, “Follow me!”
and started running. Behind him her feet padded softly in the
hollow silence. They came to the fork where the side tunnel
led off into the rock. Which way would the men come? Down
the side tunnel or along the catwalk in the main tunnel? The
sound of voices booming far up the side tunnel answered him.
Bond drew the girl a few feet up the main tunnel. He brought
her close to him and whispered, “I’m sorry, Honey. I’m afraid
I’m going to have to kill them.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course.” The answering whisper was matter-of-fact.
She pressed his hand and stood back to give him room. She
put her hands up to her ears.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond eased the gun out of his waistband. Softly he broke
the cylinder sideways and verified with his thumb that all six
chambers were loaded. Bond knew he wasn’t going to like
this, killing again in cold blood, but these men would be the
Chinese Negro gangsters, the strong-arm guards who did the
dirty work. They would certainly be murderers many times
over. Perhaps they were the ones who had killed Strangways
and the girl. But there was no point in trying to ease his conscience.
It was kill or be killed. He must just do it efficiently.</p>

<p class="pindent">The voices were coming closer. There were three men. They
were talking loudly, nervously. Perhaps it was many years
since they had even thought of going through the tunnel. Bond
wondered if they would look round as they came out into the
main tunnel. Or would he have to shoot them in the back?</p>

<p class="pindent">Now they were very close. He could hear their shoes scuffing
the ground.</p>

<p class="pindent">“That makes ten bucks you owe me, Sam.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Not after tonight it won’t be. Roll them bones, boy. Roll
them bones.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No dice for me tonight, feller. I’m goin’ to cut maself a
slice of de white girl.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Haw, haw, haw.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The first man came out, then the second, then the third.
They were carrying their revolvers loosely in their right hands.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said sharply, “No, you won’t.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The three men whirled round. White teeth glinted in open
mouths. Bond shot the rear man in the head and the second
man in the stomach. The front man’s gun was up. A bullet
whistled past Bond and away up the main tunnel. Bond’s gun
crashed. The man clutched at his neck and spun slowly round
and fell across the conveyor-belt. The echoes thundered
slowly up and down the tunnel. A puff of fine dust rose in the
air and settled. Two of the bodies lay still. The man with the
stomach shot writhed and jerked.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond tucked his hot gun into the waistband of his trousers.
He said roughly to the girl, “Come on.” He reached for her
hand and pulled her after him into the mouth of the side
tunnel. He said, “Sorry about that, Honey,” and started
running, pulling her after him by the hand. She said, “Don’t
be stupid.” Then there was no sound but the thud of their
naked feet on the stone floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">The air was clean in the side tunnel and it was easier going,
but, after the tension of the shooting, pain began to crowd in
again and take possession of Bond’s body. He ran automatically.
He hardly thought of the girl. His whole mind was focused on
taking the pain and on the problems that waited at the end of
the tunnel.</p>

<p class="pindent">He couldn’t tell if the shots had been heard and he had no
idea what opposition was left. His only plan was to shoot anyone
who got in his way and somehow get to the garage and the
marsh buggy. That was their only hope of getting away from
the mountain and down to the coast.</p>

<p class="pindent">The dim yellow bulbs in the ceiling flickered by overhead.
Still the tunnel stretched on. Behind him, Honey stumbled.
Bond stopped, cursing himself for not having thought of her.
She reached for him and for a moment she leaned against him
panting. “I’m sorry, James. It’s just that . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond held her to him. He said anxiously, “Are you hurt,
Honey?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No, I’m all right. It’s just that I’m so terribly tired. And
my feet got rather cut on the mountain. I fell a lot in the dark.
If we could walk a bit. We’re nearly there. And there’s a door
into the garage before we get to the machine shop. Couldn’t
we go in there?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond hugged her to him. He said, “That’s just what I’m
looking for, Honey. That’s our only hope of getting away. If
you can stick it till we get there, we’ve got a real chance.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond put his arm round her waist and took her weight. He
didn’t trust himself to look at her feet. He knew they must be
bad. It was no good being sorry for each other. There wasn’t
time for it if they were to stay alive.</p>

<p class="pindent">They started moving again, Bond’s face grim with the extra
effort, the girl’s feet leaving bloody footsteps on the ground,
and almost immediately she whispered urgently and there was
a wooden door in the wall of the tunnel and it was ajar and no
sound came from the other side.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took out his gun and gently eased the door open. The
long garage was empty. Under the neon lights the black and
gold painted dragon on wheels looked like a float waiting for
the Lord Mayor’s Show. It was pointing towards the sliding
doors and the hatch of the armoured cabin stood open. Bond
prayed that the tank was full and that the mechanic had carried
out his orders to get the damage fixed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly, from somewhere outside, there was the sound of
voices. They came nearer, several of them, jabbering urgently.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took the girl by the hand and ran forward. There was
only one place to hide—in the marsh buggy. The girl scrambled
in. Bond followed, softly pulling the door shut behind him.
They crouched, waiting. Bond thought: only three rounds left
in the gun. Too late he remembered the rack of weapons on
the wall of the garage. Now the voices were outside. There
came the clang of the door being slid back on its runners and a
confusion of talk.</p>

<p class="pindent">“How d’ya know they were shootin’?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Couldn’t been nuthin else. I should know.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Better take rifles. Here, Joe! Take that one, Lemmy! An’
some pineapples. Box under da table.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was the metallic noise of bolts being slid home and
safety catches clicked.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Some feller must a gone nuts. Couldn’t ha’ been da Limey.
You ever seen da big pus-feller in da creek? Cheessus! An’ da
rest of da tricks da Doc fixed up in da tube? An’ dat white
gal. She cain’t have been in much shape dis mornin’. Any of
you men bin to have a look?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Nossir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Haw, haw. I’se sho surprised at you fellers. Dat’s a fine
piece of ass out dere on de crab walk.”</p>

<p class="pindent">More rattling and shuffling of feet, then, “Okay let’s go!
Two abreast till we gets to da main tunnel. Shoot at da legs.
Whoever’s makin’ trouble, da Doc’ll sure want him to play
wit.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Tee-hee.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Feet echoed hollowly on the concrete. Bond held his breath
as they filed by. Would they notice the shut door of the buggy?
But they went on down the garage and into the tunnel and the
noise of them slowly faded away.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond touched the girl’s arm and put his finger to his lips.
Softly he eased open the door and listened again. Nothing.
He dropped to the ground and walked round the buggy and
went to the half-open entrance. Cautiously he edged his head
round. There was no one in sight. There was a smell of frying
food in the air that brought the saliva to Bond’s mouth. Dishes
and pans clattered in the nearest building, about twenty yards
away, and from one of the further Quonsets came the sound of
a guitar and a man’s voice singing a calypso. Dogs started to bark
half-heartedly and then were silent. The Dobermann Pinschers.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned and ran back to the end of the garage. No
sound came from the tunnel. Softly Bond closed the tunnel
door and locked and bolted it. He went to the arms-rack on
the wall and chose another Smith &amp; Wesson and a Remington
carbine. He verified that they were loaded and went to the
door of the marsh buggy and handed them in to the girl. Now
the entrance door. Bond put his shoulder to it and softly eased
it wide open. The corrugated iron rumbled hollowly. Bond
ran back and scrambled through the open hatch and into the
driver’s seat. “Shut it, Honey,” he whispered urgently and bent
and turned the ignition key.</p>

<p class="pindent">The needle on the gauge swung to Full. Pray God the
damned thing would start up quickly. Some diesels were slow.
Bond stamped his foot down on the starter.</p>

<p class="pindent">The grinding rattle was deafening. It must be audible all
over the compound! Bond stopped and tried again. The
engine fluttered and died. And again, and this time the blessed
thing fired and the strong iron pulse hammered as Bond
revved it up. Now, gently into gear. Which one? Try this. Yes,
it bit. Brake off, you bloody fool! Christ, it had nearly stalled.
But now they were out and on the track and Bond rammed his
foot down to the floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Anyone after us?” Bond had to shout above the noise of the
diesel.</p>

<p class="pindent">“No. Wait! Yes, there’s a man come out of the huts! And
another! They’re waving and shouting at us. Now some more
are coming out. One of them’s run off to the right. Another’s
gone back into the hut. He’s come out with a rifle. He’s lying
down. He’s firing!”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Close the slot! Lie down on the floor!” Bond glanced at the
speedometer. Twenty. And they were on a slope. There was
nothing more to get out of the machine. Bond concentrated on
keeping the huge bucking wheels on the track. The cabin
bounced and swayed on the springs. It was a job to keep his
hands and feet on the controls. An iron fist clanged against the
cabin. And another. What was the range? Four hundred? Good
shooting! But that would be the lot. He shouted, “Take a look,
Honey! Open the slot an inch.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“The man’s got up. He’s stopped firing. They’re all looking
after us—a whole crowd of them. Wait, there’s something else.
The dogs are coming! There’s no one with them. They’re just
tearing down the track after us. Will they catch us?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Doesn’t matter if they do. Come and sit by me, Honey.
Hold tight. Mind your head against the roof.” Bond eased up
the throttle. She was beside him. He grinned sideways at
her. “Hell, Honey. We’ve made it. When we get down to the
lake I’ll stop and shoot up the dogs. If I know those brutes
I’ve only got to kill one and the whole pack’ll stop to eat him.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond felt her hand at his neck. She kept it there as they
swayed and thundered down the track. At the lake, Bond went
on fifty yards into the water and turned the machine round and
put it in neutral. Through the oblong slot he could see the
pack streaming round the last bend. He reached down for the
rifle and pushed it through the aperture. Now the dogs were in
the water and swimming. Bond kept his finger on the trigger
and sprayed bullets into the middle of them. One floundered,
kicking. Then another and another. He could hear their snarling
screams above the clatter of the engine. There was blood in
the water. A fight had started. He saw one dog leap on one of
the wounded ones and sink its teeth into the back of its neck.
Now they all seemed to have gone berserk. They were milling
around in the frothing bloody water. Bond emptied his magazine
among them and dropped the gun on the floor. He said,
“That’s that, Honey,” and put the machine into gear and
swung it round and began rolling at an easy speed across the
shallow lake towards the distant gap in the mangroves that was
the mouth of the river.</p>

<p class="pindent">For five minutes they moved along in silence. Then Bond
put a hand on the girl’s knee and said, “We should be all right
now, Honey. When they find the boss is dead there’ll be panic.
I guess some of the brighter ones will try and get away to
Cuba in the plane or the launch. They’ll worry about their
skins, not about us. All the same, we’ll not take the canoe out
until it’s dark. I guess it’s about ten by now. We should be at
the coast in an hour. Then we’ll rest up and try and get in
shape for the trip. Weather looks all right and there’ll be a bit
more moon tonight. Think, you can make it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Her hand squeezed his neck. “Of course I can, James. But
what about you? Your poor body! It’s nothing but burns and
bruises. And what are those red marks across your stomach?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Tell you later. I’ll be okay. But you tell me what happened
to you last night. How in hell did you manage to get away from
the crabs? What went wrong with that bastard’s plan? All
night long I could only think of you out there being slowly
eaten to death. God, what a thing to have dreamed up! What
happened?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl was actually laughing. Bond looked sideways. The
golden hair was tousled and the blue eyes were heavy with lack
of sleep, but otherwise she might just be coming home from a
midnight barbecue.</p>

<p class="pindent">“That man thought he knew everything. Silly old fool.” She
might have been talking about a stupid schoolteacher. “He’s
much more impressed by the black crabs than I am. To begin
with, I don’t mind any animal touching me, and anyway those
crabs wouldn’t think of even nipping someone if they stay
quite still and haven’t got an open sore or anything. The whole
point is that they don’t really like meat. They live mostly on
plants and things. If he was right and he did kill a black girl
that way, either she had an open wound or she must have died
of fright. He must have wanted to see if I’d stand it. Filthy old
man. I only fainted down there at dinner because I knew he’d
have something much worse for you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, I’m damned. I wish to heaven I’d known that. I
thought of you being picked to pieces.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl snorted. “Of course it wasn’t very nice having my
clothes taken off and being tied down to pegs in the ground.
But those black men didn’t dare touch me. They just made
jokes and then went away. It wasn’t very comfortable out there
on the rock, but I was thinking of you and how I could get at
Doctor No and kill him. Then I heard the crabs beginning to
run—that’s what we call it in Jamaica—and soon they came
scurrying and rattling along—hundreds of them. I just lay still
and thought of you. They walked round me and over me. I
might have been a rock for all they cared. They tickled a bit.
One annoyed me by trying to pull out a bit of my hair. But
they don’t smell or anything, and I just waited for the early
morning when they crawl into holes and go to sleep. I got quite
fond of them. They were company. Then they got fewer and
fewer and finally stopped coming and I could move. I pulled
at all the pegs in turn and then concentrated on my right-hand
one. In the end I got it out of the crack in the rock and the rest
was easy. I got back to the buildings and began scouting about.
I got into the machine shop near the garage and found this
filthy old suit. Then the conveyor thing started up not far
away and I thought about it and I guessed it must be taking
the guano through the mountain. I knew you must be dead by
then,” the quiet voice was matter-of-fact, “so I thought I’d
get to the conveyor somehow and get through the mountain
and kill Doctor No. I took a screwdriver to do it with.” She
giggled. “When we ran into each other, I’d have stuck it into
you only it was in my pocket and I couldn’t get to it. I found
the door in the back of the machine shop and walked through
and into the main tunnel. That’s all.” She caressed the back of
his neck. “I ran along watching my step and the next thing I
knew was your head hitting me in the stomach.” She giggled
again. “Darling, I hope I didn’t hurt you too much when we
were fighting. My Nanny told me always to hit men there.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. “She did, did she?” He reached out and
caught her by the hair and pulled her face to him. Her mouth
felt its way round his cheek and locked itself against his.</p>

<p class="pindent">The machine gave a sideways lurch. The kiss ended. They
had hit the first mangrove roots at the entrance to the river.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_20">XX<br class="lgl"/> SLAVE-TIME</h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap1"><span class="calibre1">“Y</span></span><span class="sc">ou’re quite</span> sure of all this?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The Acting Governor’s eyes were hunted, resentful.
How could these things have been going on under his nose,
in one of Jamaica’s dependencies? What would the Colonial
Office have to say about it? He already saw the long, pale blue
envelope marked ‘Personal. For Addressee Only’, and the
foolscap page with those very wide margins: ‘The Secretary
of State for the Colonies has instructed me to express to you
his surprise . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, sir. Quite sure.” Bond had no sympathy for the man.
He hadn’t liked the reception he had had on his last visit to
King’s House, nor the mean comments on Strangways and
the girl. He liked the memory of them even less now that he
knew his friend and the girl were at the bottom of the Mona
Reservoir.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Er—well we mustn’t let any of this get out to the Press.
You understand that? I’ll send my report in to the Secretary of
State by the next bag. I’m sure I can rely on your . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Excuse me, sir.” The Brigadier in command of the Caribbean
Defence Force was a modern young soldier of thirty-five.
His military record was good enough for him to be unimpressed
by relics from the Edwardian era of Colonial Governors, whom
he collectively referred to as ‘feather-hatted fuddy-duddies’.
“I think we can assume that Commander Bond is unlikely to
communicate with anyone except his Department. And if I
may say so, sir, I submit that we should take steps to clear up
Crab Key without waiting for approval from London. I can
provide a platoon ready to embark by this evening. HMS
<span class="it">Narvik</span> came in yesterday. If the programme of receptions and
cocktail parties for her could possibly be deferred for forty-eight
hours or so . . .” The Brigadier let his sarcasm hang in
the air.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I agree with the Brigadier, sir.” The voice of the Police
Superintendent was edgy. Quick action might save him from a
reprimand, but it would have to be quick. “And in any case
I shall have to proceed immediately against the various
Jamaicans who appear to be implicated. I’ll have to get the
divers working at Mona. If this case is to be cleaned up we
can’t afford to wait for London. As Mister—er—Commander
Bond says, most of these Negro gangsters will probably be in
Cuba by now. Have to get in touch with my opposite number
in Havana and catch up with them before they take to the hills
or go underground. I think we ought to move at once, sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was silence in the cool shadowy room where the
meeting was being held. On the ceiling above the massive
mahogany conference table there was an unexpected dapple
of sunlight. Bond guessed that it shone up through the slats
of the jalousies from a fountain or a lily pond in the garden
outside the tall windows. Far away there was the sound of
tennis balls being knocked about. Distantly a young girl’s
voice called, “Smooth. Your serve, Gladys.” The Governor’s
children? Secretaries? From one end of the room King George
VI, from the other end the Queen, looked down the table with
grace and good humour.</p>

<p class="pindent">“What do you think, Colonial Secretary?” The Governor’s
voice was hustled.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond listened to the first few words. He gathered that
Pleydell-Smith agreed with the other two. He stopped listening.
His mind drifted into a world of tennis courts and lily
ponds and kings and queens, of London, of people being
photographed with pigeons on their heads in Trafalgar Square,
of the forsythia that would soon be blazing on the bypass
roundabouts, of May, the treasured housekeeper in his flat off
the King’s Road, getting up to brew herself a cup of tea (here
it was eleven o’clock. It would be four o’clock in London),
of the first tube trains beginning to run, shaking the ground
beneath his cool, dark bedroom. Of the douce weather of England:
the soft airs, the heat waves, the cold spells—‘The only
country where you can take a walk every day of the year’—Chesterfield’s
Letters? And then Bond thought of Crab Key,
of the hot ugly wind beginning to blow, of the stink of the
marsh gas from the mangrove swamps, the jagged grey, dead
coral in whose holes the black crabs were now squatting, the
black and red eyes moving swiftly on their stalks as a shadow—a
cloud, a bird—broke their small horizons. Down in the
bird colony the brown and white and pink birds would be
stalking in the shallows, or fighting or nesting, while up on
the guanera the cormorants would be streaming back from their
breakfast to deposit their milligramme of rent to the landlord
who would no longer be collecting. And where would the
landlord be? The men from the SS <span class="it">Blanche</span> would have dug
him out. The body would have been examined for signs of life
and then put somewhere. Would they have washed the yellow
dust off him and dressed him in his kimono while the Captain
radioed Antwerp for instructions? And where had Doctor No’s
soul gone to? Had it been a bad soul or just a mad one? Bond
thought of the burned twist down in the swamp that had been
Quarrel. He remembered the soft ways of the big body, the
innocence in the grey, horizon-seeking eyes, the simple lusts
and desires, the reverence for superstitions and instincts, the
childish faults, the loyalty and even love that Quarrel had given
him—the warmth, there was only one word for it, of the man.
Surely he hadn’t gone to the same place as Doctor No. Whatever
happened to dead people, there was surely one place for
the warm and another for the cold. And which, when the time
came, would he, Bond, go to?</p>

<p class="pindent">The Colonial Secretary was mentioning Bond’s name. Bond
pulled himself together.</p>

<p class="pindent">“. . . survived is quite extraordinary. I do think, sir, that we
should show our gratitude to Commander Bond and to his
Service by accepting his recommendations. It does seem, sir,
that he has done at least three-quarters of the job. Surely the
least we can do is look after the other quarter.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The Governor grunted. He squinted down the table at
Bond. The chap didn’t seem to be paying much attention. But
one couldn’t be sure with these Secret Service fellows. Dangerous
chaps to have around, sniffing and snooping. And
their damned Chief carried a lot of guns in Whitehall. Didn’t
do to get on the wrong side of him. Of course there was something
to be said for sending the <span class="it">Narvik</span>. News would leak, of
course. All the Press of the world would be coming down on his
head. But then suddenly the Governor saw the headlines:
‘GOVERNOR TAKES SWIFT ACTION . . . ISLAND’S
STRONG MAN INTERVENES . . . THE NAVY’S
THERE!’ Perhaps after all it would be better to do it that way.
Even go down and see the troops off himself. Yes, that was it,
by jove. Cargill, of the <span class="it">Gleaner</span>, was coming to lunch. He’d
drop a hint or two to the chap and make sure the story got
proper coverage. Yes, that was it. That was the way to play the
hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Governor raised his hands and let them fall flat on the
table in a gesture of submission. He embraced the conference
with a wry smile of surrender.</p>

<p class="pindent">“So I am overruled, gentlemen. Well, then,” the voice was
avuncular, telling the children that just this once . . . “I accept
your verdict. Colonial Secretary, will you please call upon the
commanding officer of HMS <span class="it">Narvik</span> and explain the position.
In strict confidence, of course. Brigadier, I leave the military
arrangements in your hands. Superintendent, you will know
what to do.” The Governor rose. He inclined his head regally
in the direction of Bond. “And it only remains to express my
appreciation to Commander—er—Bond, for his part in this
affair. I shall not fail to mention your assistance, Commander,
to the Secretary of State.”</p>

<p class="noindent"> </p>

<p class="noindent"> </p>

<p class="pindent">Outside the sun blazed down on the gravel sweep. The
interior of the Hillman Minx was a Turkish bath. Bond’s
bruised hands cringed as they took the wheel.</p>

<p class="pindent">Pleydell-Smith leant through the window. He said, “Ever
heard the Jamaican expression ‘rarse’?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“ ‘Rarse, man’ is a vulgar expression meaning—er—‘stuff it
up’. If I may say so, it would have been appropriate for you
to have used the expression just now. However,” Pleydell-Smith
gave a wave of his hand which apologized for his Chief
and dismissed him, “is there anything else I can do for you?
You really think you ought to go back to Beau Desert? They
were quite definite at the hospital that they want to have you
for a week.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thanks,” said Bond shortly, “but I’ve got to get back. See
the girl’s all right. Would you tell the hospital I’ll be back
tomorrow? You got off that signal to my Chief?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Urgent rates.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, then,” Bond pressed the self-starter, “I guess that’s
the lot. You’ll see the Jamaica Institute people about the girl,
won’t you? She really knows the hell of a lot about the natural
history side of the island. Not from books either. If they’ve got
the right sort of job . . . Like to see her settled. I’ll take her up
to New York myself and see her through the operation. She’d
be ready to start in a couple of weeks after that. Incidentally,”
Bond looked embarrassed, “she’s really the hell of a fine girl.
When she comes back . . . if you and your wife . . . You know.
Just so there’s someone to keep an eye on her.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Pleydell-Smith smiled. He thought he had the picture. He
said, “Don’t worry about that. I’ll see to it. Betty’s rather a
hand at that sort of thing. She’ll like taking the girl under her
wing. Nothing else? See you later in the week, anyway. That
hospital’s the hell of a place in this heat. You might care to
spend a night or two with us before you go ho—I mean to
New York. Glad to have you—er—both.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thanks. And thanks for everything else.” Bond put the
car into gear and went off down the avenue of flaming tropical
shrubbery. He went fast, scattering the gravel on the bends.
He wanted to get the hell away from King’s House, and the
tennis, and the kings and queens. He even wanted to get the
hell away from the kindly Pleydell-Smith. Bond liked the man,
but all he wanted now was to get back across the Junction
Road to Beau Desert and away from the smooth world. He
swung out past the sentry at the gates and on to the main road.
He put his foot down.</p>

<p class="pindent">The night voyage under the stars had been without incident.
No one had come after them. The girl had done most of the
sailing. Bond had not argued with her. He had lain in the
bottom of the boat, totally collapsed, like a dead man. He had
woken once or twice and listened to the slap of the sea against
the hull and watched her quiet profile under the stars. Then
the cradle of the soft swell had sent him back to sleep and to
the nightmares that reached out after him from Crab Key. He
didn’t mind them. He didn’t think he would ever mind a nightmare
now. After what had happened the night before, it would
have to be strong stuff that would ever frighten him again.</p>

<p class="pindent">The crunch of a nigger-head against the hull had woken him.
They were coming through the reef into Morgan’s Harbour.
The first quarter moon was up, and inside the reef the sea was
a silver mirror. The girl had brought the canoe through under
sail. They slid across the bay to the little fringe of sand and the
bows under Bond’s head sighed softly into it. She had had to
help him out of the boat and across the velvet lawn and into
the house. He had clung to her and cursed her softly as she
had cut his clothes off him and taken him into the shower. She
had said nothing when she had seen his battered body under
the lights. She had turned the water full on and taken soap
and washed him down as if he had been a horse. Then she led
him out from under the water and dabbed him softly dry with
towels that were soon streaked with blood. He had seen her
reach for the bottle of Milton. He had groaned and taken hold
of the washbasin and waited for it. Before she had begun to put
it on him, she had come round and kissed him on the lips. She
had said softly, “Hold tight, my darling. And cry. It’s going to
hurt,” and as she splashed the murderous stuff over his body
the tears of pain had run out of his eyes and down his cheeks
without shame.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then there had been a wonderful breakfast as the dawn
flared up across the bay, and then the ghastly drive over to
Kingston to the white table of the surgery in the emergency
ward. Pleydell-Smith had been summoned. No questions had
been asked. Merthiolate had been put on the wounds and tannic
ointment on the burns. The efficient Negro doctor had written
busily in the duty report. What? Probably just ‘Multiple burns
and contusions’. Then, with promises to come into the private
ward on the next day, Bond had gone off with Pleydell-Smith
to King’s House and to the first of the meetings that had
ended with the full-dress conference. Bond had enciphered a
short signal to M via the Colonial Office which he had coolly
concluded with: ‘<span class="sc">regret must again request sick leave stop
surgeons report follows stop kindly inform armourer
smith and wesson ineffective against flame-thrower
endit.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">Now, as Bond swung the little car down the endless S-bends
towards the North Shore, he regretted the gibe. M wouldn’t
like it. It was cheap. It wasted cipher groups. Oh well! Bond
swerved to avoid a thundering red bus with ‘Brownskin Gal’
on the destination plate. He had just wanted M to know that
it hadn’t quite been a holiday in the sun. He would apologize
when he sent in his written report.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s bedroom was cool and dark. There was a plate of
sandwiches and a Thermos full of coffee beside the turned-down
bed. On the pillow was a sheet of paper with big childish
writing. It said, “You are staying with me tonight. I can’t
leave my animals. They were fussing. And I can’t leave you.
And you owe me slave-time. I will come at seven. Your H.”</p>

<p class="pindent">In the dusk she came across the lawn to where Bond was
sitting finishing his third glass of Bourbon-on-the-rocks. She
was wearing a black and white striped cotton skirt and a tight
sugar-pink blouse. The golden hair smelled of cheap shampoo.
She looked incredibly fresh and beautiful. She reached out
her hand and Bond took it and followed her up the drive and
along a narrow well-trodden path through the sugar cane. It
wound along for quite a way through the tall whispering sweet-scented
jungle. Then there was a patch of tidy lawn up against
thick broken stone walls and steps that led down to a heavy
door whose edges glinted with light.</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked up at him from the door. “Don’t be frightened.
The cane’s high and they’re most of them out.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond didn’t know what he had expected. He had vaguely
thought of a flat earthen floor and rather damp walls. There
would be a few sticks of furniture, a broken bedstead covered
with rags, and a strong zoo smell. He had been prepared to be
careful about hurting her feelings.</p>

<p class="pindent">Instead it was rather like being inside a very large tidy
cigar-box. The floor and ceiling were of highly polished cedar
that gave out a cigar-box smell and the walls were panelled
with wide split bamboo. The light came from a dozen candles
in a fine silver chandelier that hung from the centre of the
ceiling. High up in the walls there were three square windows
through which Bond could see the dark blue sky and the stars.
There were several pieces of good nineteenth-century furniture.
Under the chandelier a table was laid for two with
expensive-looking old-fashioned silver and glass.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “Honey, what a lovely room. From what you said
I thought you lived in a sort of zoo.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She laughed delightedly. “I got out the old silver and things.
It’s all I’ve got. I had to spend the day polishing it. I’ve never
had it out before. It does look rather nice, doesn’t it? You see,
generally there are a lot of little cages up against the wall. I
like having them with me. It’s company. But now that you’re
here . . .” She paused. “My bedroom’s in there,” she gestured
at the other door. “It’s very small, but there’s room for both
of us. Now come on. I’m afraid it’s cold dinner—just lobsters
and fruit.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked over to her. He took her in his arms and kissed
her hard on the lips. He held her and looked down into the
shining blue eyes. “Honey, you’re a wonderful girl. You’re one
of the most wonderful girls I’ve ever known. I hope the world’s
not going to change you too much. D’you really want to have
that operation? I love your face—just as it is. It’s part of you.
Part of all this.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She frowned and freed herself. “You’re not to be serious
tonight. Don’t talk about these things. I don’t want to talk
about them. This is my night with you. Please talk about love.
I don’t want to hear about anything else. Promise? Now come
on. You sit there.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat down. He smiled up at her. He said, “I promise.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She said, “Here’s the mayonnaise. It’s not out of a bottle.
I made it myself. And take some bread and butter.” She sat
down opposite him and began to eat, watching him. When she
saw that he seemed satisfied she said, “Now you can start
telling me about love. Everything about it. Everything you
know.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked across into the flushed, golden face. The eyes
were bright and soft in the candlelight, but with the same
imperious glint they had held when he had first seen her on
the beach and she had thought he had come to steal her shells.
The full red lips were open with excitement and impatience.
With him she had no inhibitions. They were two loving
animals. It was natural. She had no shame. She could ask him
anything and would expect him to answer. It was as if they
were already in bed together, lovers. Through the tight cotton
bodice the points of her breasts showed, hard and roused.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “Are you a virgin?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Not quite. I told you. That man.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well . . .” Bond found he couldn’t eat any more. His mouth
was dry at the thought of her. He said, “Honey, I can either
eat or talk love to you. I can’t do both.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You’re going over to Kingston tomorrow. You’ll get plenty
to eat there. Talk love.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s eyes were fierce blue slits. He got up and went down
on one knee beside her. He picked up her hand and looked into
it. At the base of the thumb the Mount of Venus swelled
luxuriously. Bond bent his head down into the warm soft hand
and bit softly into the swelling. He felt her other hand in his
hair. He bit harder. The hand he was holding curled round his
mouth. She was panting. He bit still harder. She gave a little
scream and wrenched his head away by the hair.</p>

<p class="pindent">“What are you doing?” Her eyes were wide and dark. She
had gone pale. She dropped her eyes and looked at his mouth.
Slowly she pulled his head towards her.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond put out a hand to her left breast and held it hard. He
lifted her captive, wounded hand and put it round his neck.
Their mouths met and clung, exploring.</p>

<p class="pindent">Above them the candles began to dance. A big hawkmoth
had come in through one of the windows. It whirred round the
chandelier. The girl’s closed eyes opened, looked at the moth.
Her mouth drew away. She smoothed the handful of his hair
back and got up, and without saying anything took down the
candles one by one and blew them out. The moth whirred
away through one of the windows.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl stood away from the table. She undid her blouse
and threw it on the floor. Then her skirt. Under the glint of
moonlight she was a pale figure with a central shadow. She
came to Bond and took him by the hand and lifted him up. She
undid his shirt and slowly, carefully took it off. Her body, close
to him, smelled of new-mown hay and sweet pepper. She led
him away from the table and through a door. The filtering
moonlight shone down on a single bed. On the bed was a
sleeping-bag, its mouth laid open.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl let go his hand and climbed into the sleeping-bag.
She looked up at him. She said, practically, “I bought this
today. It’s a double one. It cost a lot of money. Take those off
and come in. You promised. You owe me slave-time.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“But . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Do as you’re told.”</p>
