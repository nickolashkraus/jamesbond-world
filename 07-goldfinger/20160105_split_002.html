CHAPTER ONE
<br class="calibre6"/>
REFLECTIONS IN A DOUBLE BOURBON
</h3>

<p class="calibre4">
James Bond, with two double bourbons inside him,
sat in the final departure lounge of Miami Airport
and thought about life and death.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
It was part of his profession to kill people.  He had never
liked doing it and when he had to kill he did it as well as
he knew how and forgot about it.  As a secret agent who
held the rare double-O prefix—the licence to kill in the
Secret Service—it was his duty to be as cool about death
as a surgeon.  If it happened, it happened.  Regret was
unprofessional—worse, it was death-watch beetle in
the soul.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
And yet there had been something curiously impressive
about the death of the Mexican.  It wasn't that he hadn't
deserved to die.  He was an evil man, a man they call in
Mexico a <i class="calibre3">capungo</i>.  A capungo is a bandit who will kill
for as little as forty pesos, which is about twenty-five
shillings—though probably he had been paid more to
attempt the killing of Bond—and, from the look of him,
he had been an instrument of pain and misery all his life.
Yes, it had certainly been time for him to die; but when
Bond had killed him, less than twenty-four hours before,
life had gone out of the body so quickly, so utterly, that
Bond had almost seen it come out of his mouth as it does,
in the shape of a bird, in Haitian primitives.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
What an extraordinary difference there was between a
body full of person and a body that was empty!  Now there
is someone, now there is no one.  This had been a Mexican
with a name and an address, an employment card and
perhaps a driving licence.  Then something had gone out
of him, out of the envelope of flesh and cheap clothes, and
had left him an empty paper bag waiting for the dustcart.
And the difference, the thing that had gone out of
the stinking Mexican bandit, was greater than all Mexico.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond looked down at the weapon that had done it.  The
cutting edge of his right hand was red and swollen.  It
would soon show a bruise.  Bond flexed the hand,
kneading it with his left.  He had been doing the same
thing at intervals through the quick plane trip that had
got him away.  It was a painful process, but if he kept the
circulation moving the hand would heal more quickly.
One couldn't tell how soon the weapon would be needed
again.  Cynicism gathered at the corners of Bond's mouth.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'National Airlines, "Airline of the Stars", announces
the departure of their flight NA 106 to La Guardia Field,
New York.  Will all passengers please proceed to gate
number seven.  All aboard, please.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The Tannoy switched off with an echoing click.  Bond
glanced at his watch.  At least another ten minutes before
Transamerica would be called.  He signalled to a waitress
and ordered another double bourbon on the rocks.  When
the wide, chunky glass came, he swirled the liquor round
for the ice to blunt it down and swallowed half of it.  He
stubbed out the butt of his cigarette and sat, his chin
resting on his left hand, and gazed moodily across the
twinkling tarmac to where the last half of the sun was slipping
gloriously into the Gulf.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The death of the Mexican had been the finishing touch
to a bad assignment, one of the worst—squalid, dangerous
and without any redeeming feature except that it had got
him away from headquarters.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
A big man in Mexico had some poppy fields.  The
flowers were not for decoration.  They were broken down
for opium which was sold quickly and comparatively
cheaply by the waiters at a small café in Mexico City
called the 'Madre de Cacao'.  The Madre de Cacao had
plenty of protection.  If you needed opium you walked in
and ordered what you wanted with your drink.  You paid
for your drink at the caisse and the man at the caisse told
you how many noughts to add to your bill.  It was an
orderly commerce of no concern to anyone outside Mexico.
Then, far away in England, the Government, urged on by
the United Nations' drive against drug smuggling,
announced that heroin would be banned in Britain.  There
was alarm in Soho and also among respectable doctors who
wanted to save their patients agony.  Prohibition is the
trigger of crime.  Very soon the routine smuggling channels
from China, Turkey and Italy were run almost dry by the
illicit stock-piling in England.  In Mexico City, a
pleasant-spoken Import and Export merchant called Blackwell had
a sister in England who was a heroin addict.  He loved her
and was sorry for her and, when she wrote that she would
die if someone didn't help, he believed that she wrote the
truth and set about investigating the illicit dope traffic in
Mexico.  In due course, through friends and friends of
friends, he got to the Madre de Cacao and on from there
to the big Mexican grower.  In the process, he came to
know about the economics of the trade, and he decided
that if he could make a fortune and at the same time help
suffering humanity he had found the Secret of Life.
Blackwell's business was in fertilizers.  He had a warehouse
and a small plant and a staff of three for soil testing and
plant research.  It was easy to persuade the big Mexican
that, behind this respectable front, Blackwell's team could
busy itself extracting heroin from opium.  Carriage to
England was swiftly arranged by the Mexican.  For the
equivalent of a thousand pounds a trip, every month one
of the diplomatic couriers of the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs carried an extra suitcase to London.  The price was
reasonable.  The contents of the suitcase, after the Mexican
had deposited it at the Victoria Station left-luggage office
and had mailed the ticket to a man called Schwab, c/o
Boox-an-Pix, Ltd, W.C.1, were worth twenty thousand
pounds.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Unfortunately Schwab was a bad man, unconcerned
with suffering humanity.  He had the idea that if American
juvenile delinquents could consume millions of dollars'
worth of heroin every year, so could their Teddy boy and
girl cousins.  In two rooms in Pimlico, his staff watered the
heroin with stomach powder and sent it on its way to the
dance halls and amusement arcades.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Schwab had already made a fortune when the C.I.D. Ghost
Squad got on to him.  Scotland Yard decided to let
him make a little more money while they investigated the
source of his supply.  They put a close tail on Schwab and
in due course were led to Victoria Station and thence to
the Mexican courier.  At that stage, since a foreign country
was concerned, the Secret Service had had to be called in
and Bond was ordered to find out where the courier got his
supplies and to destroy the channel at source.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond did as he was told.  He flew to Mexico City and
quickly got to the Madre de Cacao.  Thence, posing as a
buyer for the London traffic, he got back to the big
Mexican.  The Mexican received him amiably and
referred him to Blackwell.  Bond had rather taken to
Blackwell.  He knew nothing about Blackwell's sister, but the
man was obviously an amateur and his bitterness about
the heroin ban in England rang true.  Bond broke into his
warehouse one night and left a thermite bomb.  He then
went and sat in a café a mile away and watched the
flames leap above the horizon of roof-tops and listened to
the silver cascade of the fire-brigade bells.  The next
morning he telephoned Blackwell.  He stretched a
handkerchief across the mouthpiece and spoke through it.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Sorry you lost your business last night.  I'm afraid your
insurance won't cover those stocks of soil you were
researching.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Who's that?  Who's speaking?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I'm from England.  That stuff of yours has killed quite a
lot of young people over there.  Damaged a lot of others.
Santos won't be coming to England any more with his
diplomatic bag.  Schwab will be in jail by tonight.  That
fellow Bond you've been seeing, he won't get out of the net
either.  The police are after him now.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Frightened words came back down the line.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'All right, but just don't do it again.  Stick to fertilizers.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond hung up.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Blackwell wouldn't have had the wits.  It was obviously
the big Mexican who had seen through the false trail.
Bond had taken the precaution to move his hotel, but that
night, as he walked home after a last drink at the
Copacabana, a man suddenly stood in his way.  The man wore
a dirty white linen suit and a chauffeur's white cap that
was too big for his head.  There were deep blue shadows
under Aztec cheek-bones.  In one corner of the slash of a
mouth there was a toothpick and in the other a cigarette.
The eyes were bright pinpricks of marihuana.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'You like woman?  Make jigajig?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'No.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Coloured girl?  Fine jungle tail?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'No.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Mebbe pictures?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The gesture of the hand slipping into the coat was so
well known to Bond, so full of old dangers, that, when the
hand flashed out and the long silver finger went for his
throat, Bond was on balance and ready for it.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Almost automatically, Bond went into the 'Parry
Defence against Underhand Thrust' out of the book.  His
right arm cut across, his body swivelling with it.  The two
forearms met mid-way between the two bodies, banging
the Mexican's knife arm off target and opening his guard
for a crashing short-arm chin jab with Bond's left.  Bond's
stiff, locked wrist had not travelled far, perhaps two feet,
but the heel of his palm, with fingers spread for rigidity,
had come up and under the man's chin with terrific
force.  The blow almost lifted the man off the sidewalk.
Perhaps it had been that blow that had killed the Mexican,
broken his neck, but as he staggered back on his way to
the ground, Bond had drawn back his right hand and
slashed sideways at the taut, offered throat.  It was the
deadly hand-edge blow to the Adam's apple, delivered
with the fingers locked into a blade, that had been the
stand-by of the Commandos.  If the Mexican was still
alive, he was certainly dead before he hit the ground.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond stood for a moment, his chest heaving, and looked
at the crumpled pile of cheap clothes flung down in the
dust.  He glanced up and down the street.  There was no
one.  Some cars passed.  Others had perhaps passed during
the fight, but it had been in the shadows.  Bond knelt down
beside the body.  There was no pulse.  Already the eyes
that had been so bright with marihuana were glazing.
The house in which the Mexican had lived was empty.
The tenant had left.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond picked up the body and laid it against a wall in
deeper shadow.  He brushed his hands down his clothes,
felt to see if his tie was straight and went on to his hotel.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
At dawn Bond had got up and shaved and driven to the
airport where he took the first plane out of Mexico.  It
happened to be going to Caracas.  Bond flew to Caracas
and hung about in the transit lounge until there was a
plane for Miami, a Transamerica Constellation that
would take him on that same evening to New York.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Again the Tannoy buzzed and echoed.  'Transamerica
regrets to announce a delay on their flight TR 618 to New
York due to a mechanical defect.  The new departure time
will be at eight a.m.  Will all passengers please report to
the Transamerica ticket counter where arrangements for
their overnight accommodation will be made.  Thank you.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
So!  That too!  Should he transfer to another flight or
spend the night in Miami?  Bond had forgotten his drink.
He picked it up and, tilting his head back, swallowed the
bourbon to the last drop.  The ice tinkled cheerfully
against his teeth.  That was it.  That was an idea.  He
would spend the night in Miami and get drunk, stinking
drunk so that he would have to be carried to bed by
whatever tart he had picked up.  He hadn't been drunk for
years.  It was high time.  This extra night, thrown at him
out of the blue, was a spare night, a gone night.  He would
put it to good purpose.  It was time he let himself go.  He
was too tense, too introspective.  What the hell was he
doing, glooming about this Mexican, this capungo who
had been sent to kill him?  It had been kill or get killed.
Anyway, people were killing other people all the time, all
over the world.  People were using their motor cars to kill
with.  They were carrying infectious diseases around,
blowing microbes in other people's faces, leaving gas-jets
turned on in kitchens, pumping out carbon monoxide in
closed garages.  How many people, for instance, were
involved in manufacturing H-bombs, from the miners who
mined the uranium to the shareholders who owned the
mining shares?  Was there any person in the world who
wasn't somehow, perhaps only statistically, involved in
killing his neighbour?
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The last light of the day had gone.  Below the indigo
sky the flare paths twinkled green and yellow and threw
tiny reflections off the oily skin of the tarmac.  With a
shattering roar a DC7 hurtled down the main green lane.
The windows in the transit lounge rattled softly.  People
got up to watch.  Bond tried to read their expressions.
Did they hope the plane would crash—give them something
to watch, something to talk about, something to fill
their empty lives?  Or did they wish it well?  Which way
were they willing the sixty passengers?  To live or to die?
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond's lips turned down.  Cut it out.  Stop being so
damned morbid.  All this is just reaction from a dirty
assignment.  You're stale, tired of having to be tough.  You
want a change.  You've seen too much death.  You want
a slice of life—easy, soft, high.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond was conscious of steps approaching.  They stopped
at his side.  Bond looked up.  It was a clean, rich-looking,
middle-aged man.  His expression was embarrassed,
deprecating.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Pardon me, but surely it's Mr Bond ... Mr—er—James Bond?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4"><br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/><br class="calibre1"/></p>

<h3 class="calibre8">
CHAPTER TWO
<br class="calibre6"/>
LIVING IT UP
</h3>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond liked anonymity.  His 'Yes, it is' was
discouraging.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Well, that's a mighty rare coincidence.'  The man
held out his hand.  Bond rose slowly, took the hand and
released it.  The hand was pulpy and unarticulated—like
a hand-shaped mud pack, or an inflated rubber glove.
'My name is Du Pont.  Junius Du Pont.  I guess you won't
remember me, but we've met before.  Mind if I sit down?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The face, the name?  Yes, there <i class="calibre3">was</i> something familiar.
Long ago.  Not in America.  Bond searched the files while
he summed the man up.  Mr Du Pont was about fifty—pink,
clean-shaven and dressed in the conventional disguise
with which Brooks Brothers cover the shame of American
millionaires.  He wore a single-breasted dark tan tropical
suit and a white silk shirt with a shallow collar.  The rolled
ends of the collar were joined by a gold safety pin beneath
the knot of a narrow dark red and blue striped tie that
fractionally wasn't the Brigade of Guards'.  The cuffs of the
shirt protruded half an inch below the cuffs of the coat and
showed cabochon crystal links containing miniature trout
flies.  The socks were charcoal-grey silk and the shoes were
old and polished mahogany and hinted Peal.  The man
carried a dark, narrow-brimmed straw Homburg with a
wide claret ribbon.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Du Pont sat down opposite Bond and produced
cigarettes and a plain gold Zippo lighter.  Bond noticed
that he was sweating slightly.  He decided that Mr Du
Pont was what he appeared to be, a very rich American,
mildly embarrassed.  He knew he had seen him before, but
he had no idea where or when.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Smoke?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Thank you.'  It was a Parliament.  Bond affected not to
notice the offered lighter.  He disliked held-out lighters.
He picked up his own and lit the cigarette.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'France, '51, Royale les Eaux.'  Mr Du Pont looked
eagerly at Bond.  'That Casino.  Ethel, that's Mrs Du Pont,
and me were next to you at the table the night you had
the big game with the Frenchman.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond's memory raced back.  Yes, of course.  The Du
Ponts had been Nos. 4 and 5 at the baccarat table.  Bond
had been 6.  They had seemed harmless people.  He had
been glad to have such a solid bulwark on his left on that
fantastic night when he had broken Le Chiffre.  Now Bond
saw it all again—the bright pool of light on the green
baize, the pink crab hands across the table scuttling out
for the cards.  He smelled the smoke and the harsh tang of
his own sweat.  That had been a night!  Bond looked across
at Mr Du Pont and smiled at the memory.  'Yes, of course
I remember.  Sorry I was slow.  But that was quite a night.
I wasn't thinking of much except my cards.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Du Pont grinned back, happy and relieved.  'Why,
gosh, Mr Bond.  Of course I understand.  And I do hope
you'll pardon me for butting in.  You see...'  He snapped
his fingers for a waitress.  'But we must have a drink to
celebrate.  What'll you have?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Thanks.  Bourbon on the rocks.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'And dimple Haig and water.'  The waitress went away.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Du Pont leant forward, beaming.  A whiff of soap
or after-shave lotion came across the table.  Lentheric?
'I knew it was you.  As soon as I saw you sitting there.  But
I thought to myself, Junius, you don't often make an
error over a face, but let's just go make sure.  Well, I was
flying Transamerican tonight and, when they announced
the delay, I watched your expression and, if you'll pardon
me, Mr Bond, it was pretty clear from the look on your
face that you had been flying Transamerican too.'  He
waited for Bond to nod.  He hurried on.  'So I ran down to
the ticket counter and had me a look at the passenger list.
Sure enough, there it was, "J. Bond".'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Du Pont sat back, pleased with his cleverness.  The
drinks came.  He raised his glass.  'Your very good health,
sir.  This sure is my lucky day.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond smiled non-committally and drank.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Du Pont leant forward again.  He looked round.
There was nobody at the near-by tables.  Nevertheless he
lowered his voice.  'I guess you'll be saying to yourself,
well, it's nice to see Junius Du Pont again, but what's the
score?  Why's he so particularly happy at seeing me on just
this night?'  Mr Du Pont raised his eyebrows as if acting
Bond's part for him.  Bond put on a face of polite inquiry.
Mr Du Pont leant still farther across the table.  'Now, I
hope you'll forgive me, Mr Bond.  It's not like me to pry
into other people's secre ...  er—affairs.  But, after that
game at Royale, I did hear that you were not only a
grand card player, but also that you were—er—how
shall I put it?—that you were a sort of—er—investigator.
You know, kind of intelligence operative.'  Mr Du
Pont's indiscretion had made him go very red in the face.
He sat back and took out a handkerchief and wiped his
forehead.  He looked anxiously at Bond.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond shrugged his shoulders.  The grey-blue eyes that
looked into Mr Du Pont's eyes, which had turned hard
and watchful despite his embarrassment, held a mixture of
candour, irony and self-deprecation.  'I used to dabble in
that kind of thing.  Hangover from the war.  One still
thought it was fun playing Red Indians.  But there's no
future in it in peacetime.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Quite, quite.'  Mr Du Pont made a throwaway gesture
with the hand that held the cigarette.  His eyes evaded
Bond's as he put the next question, waited for the next lie.
(Bond thought, there's a wolf in this Brooks Brothers
clothing.  This is a shrewd man.)  'And now you've settled
down?'  Mr Du Pont smiled paternally.  'What did you
choose, if you'll pardon the question?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Import and Export.  I'm with Universal.  Perhaps you've
come across them.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Du Pont continued to play the game.  'Hm.  Universal.
Let me see.  Why, yes, sure I've heard of them.
Can't say I've ever done business with them, but I guess
it's never too late.'  He chuckled fatly.  'I've got quite a
heap of interests all over the place.  Only stuff I can
honestly say I'm not interested in is chemicals.  Maybe it's
my misfortune, Mr Bond, but I'm not one of the chemical
Du Ponts.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond decided that the man was quite satisfied with the
particular brand of Du Pont he happened to be.  He made
no comment.  He glanced at his watch to hurry Mr Du
Pont's play of the hand.  He made a note to handle his
own cards carefully.  Mr Du Pont had a nice pink kindly
baby-face with a puckered, rather feminine turn-down
mouth.  He looked as harmless as any of the middle-aged
Americans with cameras who stand outside Buckingham
Palace.  But Bond sensed many tough, sharp qualities
behind the fuddyduddy façade.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Du Pont's sensitive eye caught Bond's glance at his
watch.  He consulted his own.  'My, oh my!  Seven o'clock
and here I've been talking away without coming to the
point.  Now, see here, Mr Bond.  I've got me a problem on
which I'd greatly appreciate your guidance.  If you can
spare me the time and if you were counting on stopping
over in Miami tonight I'd reckon it a real favour if you'd
allow me to be your host.'  Mr Du Pont held up his hand.
'Now, I think I can promise to make you comfortable.
So happens I own a piece of the Floridiana.  Maybe you
heard we opened around Christmas time?  Doing a great
business I'm happy to say.  Really pushing that little old
Fountain Blue.'  Mr Du Pont laughed indulgently.
'That's what we call the Fontainebleau down here.  Now,
what do you say, Mr Bond?  You shall have the best
suite—even if it means putting some good paying customers
out on the sidewalk.  And you'd be doing me a real
favour.'  Mr Du Pont looked imploring.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond had already decided to accept—blind.  Whatever
Mr Du Pont's problem—blackmail, gangsters, women—it
would be some typical form of rich man's worry.  Here
was a slice of the easy life he had been asking for.  Take it.
Bond started to say something politely deprecating.  Mr
Du Pont interrupted.  'Please, please, Mr Bond.  And
believe me, I'm grateful, very grateful indeed.'  He snapped
his fingers for the waitress.  When she came, he turned
away from Bond and settled the bill out of Bond's sight.
Like many very rich men he considered that showing
his money, letting someone see how much he tipped,
amounted to indecent exposure.  He thrust his roll back
into his trousers pocket (the hip pocket is not the place
among the rich) and took Bond by the arm.  He sensed
Bond's resistance to the contact and removed his hand.
They went down the stairs to the main hall.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Now, let's just straighten out your reservation.'  Mr Du
Pont headed for the Transamerica ticket counter.  In a
few curt phrases Mr Du Pont showed his power and
efficiency in his own, his American, realm.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes, Mr Du Pont.  Surely, Mr Du Pont.  I'll take care
of that, Mr Du Pont.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Outside, a gleaming Chrysler Imperial sighed up to the
kerb.  A tough-looking chauffeur in a biscuit-coloured
uniform hurried to open the door.  Bond stepped in and
settled down in the soft upholstery.  The interior of the car
was deliciously cool, almost cold.  The Transamerican
representative bustled out with Bond's suitcase, handed it
to the chauffeur and, with a half-bow, went back into the
Terminal.  'Bill's on the Beach,' said Mr Du Pont to the
chauffeur and the big car slid away through the crowded
parking lots and out on to the parkway.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Du Pont settled back.  'Hope you like stone crabs,
Mr Bond.  Ever tried them?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said he had, that he liked them very much.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Du Pont talked about Bill's on the Beach and about
the relative merits of stone and Alaska crab meat while
the Chrysler Imperial sped through downtown Miami,
along Biscayne Boulevard and across Biscayne Bay by the
Douglas MacArthur Causeway.  Bond made appropriate
comments, letting himself be carried along on the gracious
stream of speed and comfort and rich small-talk.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
They drew up at a white-painted, mock-Regency frontage
in clapboard and stucco.  A scrawl of pink neon said:
BILL'S ON THE BEACH.  While Bond got out, Mr Du Pont
gave his instructions to the chauffeur.  Bond heard the
words.  'The Aloha Suite,' and 'If there's any trouble, tell
Mr Fairlie to call me here.  Right?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
They went up the steps.  Inside, the big room was
decorated in white with pink muslin swags over the
windows.  There were pink lights on the tables.  The
restaurant was crowded with sunburned people in expensive
tropical get-ups—brilliant garish shirts, jangling gold
bangles, dark glasses with jewelled rims, cute native straw
hats.  There was a confusion of scents.  The wry smell of
bodies that had been all day in the sun came through.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bill, a pansified Italian, hurried towards them.  'Why,
Mr Du Pont.  Is a pleasure, sir.  Little crowded tonight.
Soon fix you up.  Please this way please.'  Holding a
large leather-bound menu above his head the man weaved
his way between the diners to the best table in the room, a
corner table for six.  He pulled out two chairs, snapped his
fingers for the maître d'hôtel and the wine waiter, spread
two menus in front of them, exchanged compliments with
Mr Du Pont and left them.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Du Pont slapped his menu shut.  He said to Bond,
'Now, why don't you just leave this to me?  If there's
anything you don't like, send it back.'  And to the head waiter,
'Stone crabs.  Not frozen.  Fresh.  Melted butter.  Thick
toast.  Right?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Very good, Mr Du Pont.'  The wine waiter, washing his
hands, took the waiter's place.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Two pints of pink champagne.  The Pommery '50.
Silver tankards.  Right?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Vairry good, Mr Du Pont.  A cocktail to start?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Du Pont turned to Bond.  He smiled and raised his
eyebrows.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said, 'Vodka martini, please.  With a slice of
lemon peel.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Make it two,' said Mr Du Pont.  'Doubles.'  The wine
waiter hurried off.  Mr Du Pont sat back and produced his
cigarettes and lighter.  He looked round the room,
answered one or two waves with a smile and a lift of the
hand and glanced at the neighbouring tables.  He edged
his chair nearer to Bond's.  'Can't help the noise, I'm
afraid,' he said apologetically.  'Only come here for the
crabs.  They're out of this world.  Hope you're not allergic
to them.  Once brought a girl here and fed her crabs and
her lips swelled up like cycle tyres.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond was amused at the change in Mr Du Pont—this
racy talk, the authority of manner once Mr Du Pont
thought he had got Bond on the hook, on his payroll.  He
was a different man from the shy embarrassed suitor who
had solicited Bond at the airport.  What did Mr Du Pont
want from Bond?  It would be coming any minute now,
the proposition.  Bond said, 'I haven't got any allergies.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Good, good.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There was a pause.  Mr Du Pont snapped the lid of his
lighter up and down several times.  He realized he was
making an irritating noise and pushed it away from him.
He made up his mind.  He said, speaking at his hands on
the table in front of him, 'You ever play Canasta, Mr
Bond?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes, it's a good game.  I like it.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Two-handed Canasta?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I have done.  It's not so much fun.  If you don't make a
fool of yourself—if neither of you do—it tends to even
out.  Law of averages in the cards.  No chance of making
much difference in the play.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Du Pont nodded emphatically.  'Just so.  That's what
I've said to myself.  Over a hundred games or so, two
equal players will end up equal.  Not such a good game as
Gin or Oklahoma, but in a way that's just what I like
about it.  You pass the time, you handle plenty of cards,
you have your ups and downs, no one gets hurt.  Right?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond nodded.  The martinis came.  Mr Du Pont said to
the wine waiter, 'Bring two more in ten minutes.'  They
drank.  Mr Du Pont turned and faced Bond.  His face was
petulant, crumpled.  He said, 'What would you say, Mr
Bond, if I told you I'd lost twenty-five thousand dollars in
a week playing two-handed Canasta?'  Bond was about to
reply.  Mr Du Pont held up his hand.  'And mark you, I'm
a good card player.  Member of the Regency Club.  Play a
lot with people like Charlie Goren, Johnny Crawford—at
bridge that is.  But what I mean, I know my way around at
the card table.'  Mr Du Pont probed Bond's eyes.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'If you've been playing with the same man all the time,
you've been cheated.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Ex-actly.'  Mr Du Pont slapped the table-cloth.  He sat
back.  'Ex-actly.  That's what I said to myself after I'd
lost—lost for four whole days.  So I said to myself, this bastard
is cheating me and by golly I'll find out how he does it and
have him hounded out of Miami.  So I doubled the stakes
and then doubled them again.  He was quite happy about
it.  And I watched every card he played, every movement.
Nothing!  Not a hint or a sign.  Cards not marked.  New
pack whenever I wanted one.  My own cards.  Never looked
at my hand—couldn't, as I always sat dead opposite him.
No kibitzer to tip him off.  And he just went on winning
and winning.  Won again this morning.  And again this
afternoon.  Finally I got so mad at the game—I didn't
show it, mind you—' Bond might think he had not been a
sport—'I paid up politely.  But, without telling this
guy, I just packed my bag and got me to the airport
and booked on the first plane to New York.  Think of
that!'  Mr Du Pont threw up his hands.  'Running away.
But twenty-five grand is twenty-five grand.  I could see it
getting to fifty, a hundred.  And I just couldn't stand
another of these damned games and I couldn't stand not
being able to catch this guy out.  So I took off.  What do
you think of that?  Me, Junius Du Pont, throwing in the
towel because I couldn't take the licking any more!'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond grunted sympathetically.  The second round of
drinks came.  Bond was mildly interested, he was always
interested in anything to do with cards.  He could see the
scene, the two men playing and playing and the one man
quietly shuffling and dealing away and marking up his
score while the other was always throwing his cards into
the middle of the table with a gesture of controlled disgust.
Mr Du Pont was obviously being cheated.  How?  Bond
said, 'Twenty-five thousand's a lot of money.  What stakes
were you playing?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Du Pont looked sheepish.  'Quarter a point, then
fifty cents, then a dollar.  Pretty high I guess with the
games averaging around two thousand points.  Even at a
quarter, that makes five hundred dollars a game.  At a
dollar a point, if you go on losing, it's murder.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'You must have won sometimes.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Oh sure, but somehow, just as I'd got the s.o.b. all set
for a killing, he'd put down as many of his cards as he
could meld.  Got out of the bag.  Sure, I won some small
change, but only when he needed a hundred and twenty to
go down and I'd got all the wild cards.  But you know
how it is with Canasta, you have to discard right.  You lay
traps to make the other guy hand you the pack.  Well,
darn it, he seemed to be psychic!  Whenever I laid a
trap, he'd dodge it, and almost every time he laid one
for me I'd fall into it.  As for giving me the pack—why,
he'd choose the damndest cards when he was pushed—discard
singletons, aces, God knows what, and always get
away with it.  It was just as if he knew every card in my
hand.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Any mirrors in the room?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Heck, no!  We always played outdoors.  He said he
wanted to get himself a sunburn.  Certainly did that.  Red
as lobster.  He'd only play in the mornings and afternoons.
Said if he played in the evening he couldn't get to sleep.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Who is this man, anyway?  What's his name?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Goldfinger.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'First name?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Auric.  That means golden, doesn't it?  He certainly is
that.  Got flaming red hair.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Nationality?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'You won't believe it, but he's a Britisher.  Domiciled in
Nassau.  You'd think he'd be a Jew from the name, but
he doesn't look it.  We're restricted at the Floridiana.
Wouldn't have got in if he had been.  Nassavian passport.
Age forty-two.  Unmarried.  Profession, broker.  Got all
this from his passport.  Had me a peek via the house
detective when I started to play with him.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'What sort of broker?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Du Pont smiled grimly.  'I asked him.  He said, "Oh,
anything that comes along."  Evasive sort of fellow.  Clams
up if you ask him a direct question.  Talks away quite
pleasantly about nothing at all.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'What's he worth?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Ha!' said Mr Du Pont explosively.  'That's the damnedest
thing.  He's loaded.  But loaded!  I got my bank to
check with Nassau.  He's lousy with it.  Millionaires are a
dime a dozen in Nassau, but he's rated either first or
second among them.  Seems he keeps his money in gold
bars.  Shifts them around the world a lot to get the benefit
of changes in the gold price.  Acts like a damn federal
bank.  Doesn't trust currencies.  Can't say he's wrong in
that, and seeing how he's one of the richest men in the
world there must be something to his system.  But the point
is, if he's as rich as that, what the hell does he want to take
a lousy twenty-five grand off me for?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
A bustle of waiters round their table saved Bond having
to think up a reply.  With ceremony, a wide silver dish of
crabs, big ones, their shells and claws broken, was placed
in the middle of the table.  A silver sauceboat brimming
with melted butter and a long rack of toast was put beside
each of their plates.  The tankards of champagne frothed
pink.  Finally, with an oily smirk, the head waiter came
behind their chairs and, in turn, tied round their necks
long white silken bibs that reached down to the lap.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond was reminded of Charles Laughton playing Henry
VIII, but neither Mr Du Pont nor the neighbouring diners
seemed surprised at the hoggish display.  Mr Du Pont, with
a gleeful 'Every man for himself', raked several hunks of
crab on to his plate, doused them liberally in melted
butter and dug in.  Bond followed suit and proceeded to
eat, or rather devour, the most delicious meal he had had
in his life.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The meat of the stone crabs was the tenderest, sweetest
shellfish he had ever tasted.  It was perfectly set off by the
dry toast and slightly burned taste of the melted butter.
The champagne seemed to have the faintest scent of
strawberries.  It was ice cold.  After each helping of crab, the
champagne cleaned the palate for the next.  They ate
steadily and with absorption and hardly exchanged a word
until the dish was cleared.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
With a slight belch, Mr Du Pont for the last time wiped
butter off his chin with his silken bib and sat back.  His
face was flushed.  He looked proudly at Bond.  He said
reverently, 'Mr Bond, I doubt if anywhere in the world a
man has eaten as good a dinner as that tonight.  What do
you say?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond thought, I asked for the easy life, the rich life.
How do I like it?  How do I like eating like a pig and
hearing remarks like that?  Suddenly the idea of ever having
another meal like this, or indeed any other meal with Mr
Du Pont, revolted him.  He felt momentarily ashamed of
his disgust.  He had asked and it had been given.  It was the
puritan in him that couldn't take it.  He had made his
wish and the wish had not only been granted, it had been
stuffed down his throat.  Bond said, 'I don't know about
that, but it was certainly very good.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Du Pont was satisfied.  He called for coffee.  Bond
refused the offer of cigars or liqueurs.  He lit a cigarette
and waited with interest for the catch to be presented.  He
knew there would be one.  It was obvious that all this was
part of the come-on.  Well, let it come.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Du Pont cleared his throat.  'And now, Mr Bond, I
have a proposition to put to you.'  He stared at Bond,
trying to gauge his reaction in advance.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'It surely was providential to meet you like that at the
airport.'  Mr Du Pont's voice was grave, sincere.  'I've
never forgotten our first meeting at Royale.  I recall every
detail of it—your coolness, your daring, your handling of
the cards.'  Bond looked down at the table-cloth.  But Mr
Du Pont had got tired of his peroration.  He said hurriedly,
'Mr Bond, I will pay you ten thousand dollars to stay here
as my guest until you have discovered how this man
Goldfinger beats me at cards.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond looked Mr Du Pont in the eye.  He said, 'That's
a handsome offer, Mr Du Pont.  But I have to get
back to London.  I must be in New York to catch my plane
within forty-eight hours.  If you will play your usual
sessions tomorrow morning and afternoon I should have
plenty of time to find out the answer.  But I must leave
tomorrow night, whether I can help you or not.  Done?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Done,' said Mr Du Pont.

<h3 class="calibre8">
CHAPTER THREE
<br class="calibre6"/>
THE MAN WITH AGORAPHOBIA
</h3>

<p class="calibre4">
The flapping of the curtains wakened Bond.  He threw
off the single sheet and walked across the thick pile
carpet to the picture window that filled the whole of
one wall.  He drew back the curtains and went out on to
the sun-filled balcony.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The black and white chequer-board tiles were warm,
almost hot to the feet although it could not yet be eight
o'clock.  A brisk inshore breeze was blowing off the sea,
straining the flags of all nations that flew along the pier
of the private yacht basin.  The breeze was humid and
smelt strongly of the sea.  Bond guessed it was the breeze
that the visitors like, but the residents hate.  It would rust
the metal fittings in their homes, fox the pages of their
books, rot their wallpaper and pictures, breed damp-rot
in their clothes.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Twelve storeys down the formal gardens, dotted with
palm trees and beds of bright croton and traced with neat
gravel walks between avenues of bougainvillaea, were rich
and dull.  Gardeners were working, raking the paths and
picking up leaves with the lethargic slow motion of
coloured help.  Two mowers were at work on the lawns
and, where they had already been, sprinklers were
gracefully flinging handfuls of spray.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Directly below Bond, the elegant curve of the Cabana
Club swept down to the beach—two storeys of changing-rooms
below a flat roof dotted with chairs and tables and
an occasional red and white striped umbrella.  Within the
curve was the brilliant green oblong of the Olympic-length
swimming-pool fringed on all sides by row upon
row of mattressed steamer chairs on which the customers
would soon be getting their fifty-dollar-a-day sunburn.
White-jacketed men were working among them, straightening
the lines of chairs, turning the mattresses and
sweeping up yesterday's cigarette butts.  Beyond was the
long, golden beach and the sea, and more men—raking
the tideline, putting up the umbrellas, laying out
mattresses.  No wonder the neat card inside Bond's wardrobe
had said that the cost of the Aloha Suite was two hundred
dollars a day.  Bond made a rough calculation.  If he was
paying the bill, it would take him just three weeks to
spend his whole salary for the year.  Bond smiled
cheerfully to himself.  He went back into the bedroom, picked
up the telephone and ordered himself a delicious, wasteful
breakfast, a carton of king-size Chesterfields and the
newspapers.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
By the time he had shaved and had an ice-cold shower
and dressed it was eight o'clock.  He walked through into
the elegant sitting-room and found a waiter in a uniform
of plum and gold laying out his breakfast beside the
window.  Bond glanced at the <i class="calibre3">Miami Herald</i>.  The front
page was devoted to yesterday's failure of an American
ICBM at the near-by Cape Canaveral and a bad upset
in a big race at Hialeah.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond dropped the paper on the floor and sat down and
slowly ate his breakfast and thought about Mr Du Pont
and Mr Goldfinger.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
His thoughts were inconclusive.  Mr Du Pont was either
a much worse player than he thought, which seemed
unlikely on Bond's reading of his tough, shrewd character,
or else Goldfinger was a cheat.  If Goldfinger cheated at
cards, although he didn't need the money, it was certain
that he had also made himself rich by cheating or sharp
practice on a much bigger scale.  Bond was interested in
big crooks.  He looked forward to his first sight of
Goldfinger.  He also looked forward to penetrating Goldfinger's
highly successful and, on the face of it, highly mysterious
method of fleecing Mr Du Pont.  It was going to be a most
entertaining day.  Idly Bond waited for it to get underway.
The plan was that he would meet Mr Du Pont in the
garden at ten o'clock.  The story would be that Bond had
flown down from New York to try and sell Mr Du Pont a
block of shares from an English holding in a Canadian
Natural Gas property.  The matter was clearly confidential
and Goldfinger would not think of questioning Bond
about details.  Shares, Natural Gas, Canada.  That was all
Bond needed to remember.  They would go along together
to the roof of the Cabana Club where the game was
played and Bond would read his paper and watch.  After
luncheon, during which Bond and Mr Du Pont would
discuss their 'business', there would be the same routine.
Mr Du Pont had inquired if there was anything else he
could arrange.  Bond had asked for the number of Mr
Goldfinger's suite and a pass-key.  He had explained that
if Goldfinger was any kind of a professional card-sharp, or
even an expert amateur, he would travel with the usual
tools of the trade—marked and shaved cards, the apparatus
for the Short Arm Delivery, and so forth.  Mr Du Pont
had said he would give Bond the key when they met in the
garden.  He would have no difficulty getting one from the
manager.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
After breakfast, Bond relaxed and gazed into the middle
distance of the sea.  He was not keyed up by the job on
hand, only interested and amused.  It was just the kind of
job he had needed to clear his palate after Mexico.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
At half past nine Bond left his suite and wandered
along the corridors of his floor, getting lost on his way to the
elevator in order to reconnoitre the lay-out of the hotel.
Then, having met the same maid twice, he asked his way
and went down in the elevator and moved among the
scattering of early risers through the Pineapple Shopping
Arcade.  He glanced into the Bamboo Coffee Shoppe, the
Rendezvous Bar, the La Tropicala dining-room, the
Kittekat Klub for children and the Boom-Boom Nighterie.
He then went purposefully out into the garden.  Mr
Du Pont, now dressed 'for the beach' by Abercrombie &amp;
Fitch, gave him the pass-key to Goldfinger's suite.  They
sauntered over to the Cabana Club and climbed the two
short flights of stairs to the top deck.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond's first view of Mr Goldfinger was startling.  At the
far corner of the roof, just below the cliff of the hotel, a
man was lying back with his legs up on a steamer chair.
He was wearing nothing but a yellow satin bikini slip,
dark glasses and a pair of wide tin wings under his chin.
The wings, which appeared to fit round his neck, stretched
out across his shoulders and beyond them and then curved
up slightly to rounded tips.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said, 'What the hell's he wearing round his neck?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'You never seen one of those?'  Mr Du Pont was
surprised.  'That's a gadget to help your tan.  Polished
tin.  Reflects the sun up under your chin and behind the
ears—the bits that wouldn't normally catch the sun.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Well, well,' said Bond.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
When they were a few yards from the reclining figure
Mr Du Pont called out cheerfully, in what seemed to Bond
an overloud voice, 'Hi there!'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Goldfinger did not stir.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Du Pont said in his normal voice.  'He's very
deaf.'  They were now at Mr Goldfinger's feet.  Mr Du Pont
repeated his hail.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Goldfinger sat up sharply.  He removed his dark
glasses.  'Why, hullo there.'  He unhitched the wings from
round his neck, put them carefully on the ground beside
him and got heavily to his feet.  He looked at Bond with
slow, inquiring eyes.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Like you to meet Mr Bond, James Bond.  Friend of
mine from New York.  Countryman of yours.  Come down
to try and talk me into a bit of business.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Goldfinger held out a hand.  'Pleased to meet you,
Mr Bomb.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond took the hand.  It was hard and dry.  There was the
briefest pressure and it was withdrawn.  For an instant
Mr Goldfinger's pale, china-blue eyes opened wide and
stared hard at Bond.  They stared right through his face
to the back of his skull.  Then the lids drooped, the shutter
closed over the X-ray, and Mr Goldfinger took the
exposed plate and slipped it away in his filing system.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'So no game today.'  The voice was flat, colourless.  The
words were more of a statement than a question.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Whaddya mean, no game?' shouted Mr Du Pont
boisterously.  'You weren't thinking I'd let you hang on to
my money?  Got to get it back or I shan't be able to leave
this darned hotel,' Mr Du Pont chuckled richly.  'I'll tell
Sam to fix the table.  James here says he doesn't know much
about cards and he'd like to learn the game.  That right,
James?'  He turned to Bond.  'Sure you'll be all right with
your paper and the sunshine?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I'd be glad of the rest,' said Bond.  'Been travelling too
much.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Again the eyes bored into Bond and then drooped.  'I'll
get some clothes on.  I had intended to have a golf lesson
this afternoon from Mr Armour at the Boca Raton.  But
cards have priority among my hobbies.  My tendency to
un-cock the wrists too early with the mid-irons will have
to wait.'  The eyes rested incuriously on Bond.  'You play
golf, Mr Bomb?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond raised his voice.  'Occasionally, when I'm in
England.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'And where do you play?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Huntercombe.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Ah—a pleasant little course.  I have recently joined
the Royal St Marks.  Sandwich is close to one of my
business interests.  You know it?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I have played there.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'What is your handicap?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Nine.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'That is a coincidence.  So is mine.  We must have a
game one day.'  Mr Goldfinger bent down and picked up
his tin wings.  He said to Mr Du Pont, 'I will be with you
in five minutes.'  He walked slowly off towards the stairs.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond was amused.  This social sniffing at him had been
done with just the right casual touch of the tycoon who
didn't really care if Bond was alive or dead but, since he
was there and alive, might as well place him in an
approximate category.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Du Pont gave instructions to a steward in a white
coat.  Two others were already setting up a card table.
Bond walked to the rail that surrounded the roof and
looked down into the garden, reflecting on Mr Goldfinger.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
He was impressed.  Mr Goldfinger was one of the most
relaxed men Bond had ever met.  It showed in the economy
of his movement, of his speech, of his expressions.  Mr
Goldfinger wasted no effort, yet there was something
coiled, compressed, in the immobility of the man.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
When Goldfinger had stood up, the first thing that had
struck Bond was that everything was out of proportion.
Goldfinger was short, not more than five feet tall, and on
top of the thick body and blunt, peasant legs was set,
almost directly into the shoulders, a huge and it seemed
exactly round head.  It was as if Goldfinger had been put
together with bits of other people's bodies.  Nothing seemed
to belong.  Perhaps, Bond thought, it was to conceal his
ugliness that Goldfinger made such a fetish of sunburn.
Without the red-brown camouflage the pale body would
be grotesque.  The face, under the cliff of crew-cut carroty
hair, was as startling, without being as ugly, as the body.
It was moon-shaped without being moonlike.  The
forehead was fine and high and the thin sandy brows were
level above the large light blue eyes fringed with pale
lashes.  The nose was fleshily aquiline between high
cheekbones and cheeks that were more muscular than fat.  The
mouth was thin and dead straight, but beautifully drawn.
The chin and jaws were firm and glinted with health.
To sum up, thought Bond, it was the face of a thinker,
perhaps a scientist, who was ruthless, sensual, stoical and
tough.  An odd combination.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
What else could he guess?  Bond always mistrusted short
men.  They grew up from childhood with an inferiority
complex.  All their lives they would strive to be
big—bigger than the others who had teased them as a child.
Napoleon had been short, and Hitler.  It was the short men
that caused all the trouble in the world.  And what about a
misshapen short man with red hair and a bizarre face?
That might add up to a really formidable misfit.  One
could certainly feel the repressions.  There was a
powerhouse of vitality humming in the man that suggested that
if one stuck an electric bulb into Goldfinger's mouth it
would light up.  Bond smiled at the thought.  Into what
channels did Goldfinger release his vital force?  Into getting
rich?  Into sex?  Into power?  Probably into all three.  What
could his history be?  Today he might be an Englishman.
What had he been born?  Not a Jew—though there might
be Jewish blood in him.  Not a Latin or anything farther
south.  Not a Slav.  Perhaps a German—no, a Balt!
That's where he would have come from.  One of the old
Baltic provinces.  Probably got away to escape the Russians.
Goldfinger would have been warned—or his parents had
smelled trouble and they had got him out in time.  And
what had happened then?  How had he worked his way up
to being one of the richest men in the world?  One day it
might be interesting to find out.  For the time being it
would be enough to find out how he won at cards.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'All set?' Mr Du Pont called to Goldfinger who was
coming across the roof towards the card table.  With his
clothes on—a comfortably fitting dark blue suit, a white
shirt open at the neck—Goldfinger cut an almost passable
figure.  But there was no disguise for the great brown
and red football of a head and the flesh-coloured hearing
aid plugged into the left ear was not an improvement.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Du Pont sat with his back to the hotel.  Goldfinger
took the seat opposite and cut the cards.  Du Pont won the
cut, pushed the other pack over to Goldfinger, tapped
them to show they were already shuffled and he couldn't
bother to cut, and Goldfinger began the deal.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond sauntered over and took a chair at Mr Du Pont's
elbow.  He sat back, relaxed.  He made a show of folding his
paper to the sports page and watched the deal.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Somehow Bond had expected it, but this was no cardsharp.
Goldfinger dealt quickly and efficiently, but with
no hint of the Mechanic's Grip, those vital three fingers
curled round the long edge of the cards and the index
finger at the outside short upper edge—the grip that
means you are armed for dealing Bottoms or Seconds.
And he wore no signet ring for pricking the cards, no
surgical tape round a finger for marking them.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Du Pont turned to Bond.  'Deal of fifteen cards,' he
commented.  'You draw two and discard one.  Otherwise
straight Regency rules.  No monkey business with the red
treys counting one, three, five, eight, or any of that
European stuff.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Du Pont picked up his cards.  Bond noticed that he
sorted them expertly, not grading them according to value
from left to right, or holding his wild cards, of which he
had two, at the left—a pattern that might help a watchful
opponent.  Mr Du Pont concentrated his good cards in the
centre of his hand with the singletons and broken melds on
either side.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The game began.  Mr Du Pont drew first, a miraculous
pair of wild cards.  His face betrayed nothing.  He
discarded casually.  He only needed two more good draws to
go out unseen.  But he would have to be lucky.  Drawing
two cards doubles the chance of picking up what you want,
but it also doubles the chance of picking up useless cards
that will only clutter up your hand.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger played a more deliberate game, almost
irritatingly slow.  After drawing, he shuffled through his
cards again and again before deciding on his discard.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
On the third draw, Du Pont had improved his hand to
the extent that he now needed only one of five cards to
go down and out and catch his opponent with a handful of
cards which would all count against him.  As if Goldfinger
knew the danger he was in, he went down for fifty and
proceeded to make a canasta with three wild cards and
four fives.  He also got rid of some more melds and ended
with only four cards in his hand.  In any other
circumstances it would have been ridiculously bad play.  As it
was, he had made some four hundred points instead of
losing over a hundred, for, on the next draw Mr Du Pont
filled his hand and, with most of the edge taken off his
triumph by Goldfinger's escape, went down unseen with
the necessary two canastas.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'By golly, I nearly screwed you that time.'  Mr Du
Pont's voice had an edge of exasperation.  'What in hell
told you to cut an' run?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger said indifferently, 'I smelled trouble.'  He
added up his points, announced them and jotted them
down, waiting for Mr Du Pont to do the same.  Then he
cut the cards and sat back and regarded Bond with polite
interest.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Will you be staying long, Mr Bomb?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond smiled.  'It's Bond, B-O-N-D.  No, I have to go
back to New York tonight.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'How sad.'  Goldfinger's mouth pursed in polite regret.
He turned back to the cards and the game went on.  Bond
picked up his paper and gazed, unseeing, at the baseball
scores, while he listened to the quiet routine of the game.
Goldfinger won that hand and the next and the next.  He
won the game.  There was a difference of one thousand
five hundred points—one thousand five hundred dollars
to Goldfinger.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'There it goes again!'  It was the plaintive voice of Mr
Du Pont.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond put down his paper.  'Does he usually win?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Usually!'  The word was a snort.  'He always wins.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
They cut again and Goldfinger began to deal.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said, 'Don't you cut for seats?  I often find a change
of seat helps the luck.  Hostage to fortune and so on.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger paused in his deal.  He bent his gaze gravely
on Bond.  'Unfortunately, Mr Bond, that is not possible or
I could not play.  As I explained to Mr Du Pont at our
first game, I suffer from an obscure complaint—agoraphobia—the
fear of open spaces.  I cannot bear the open
horizon.  I must sit and face the hotel.'  The deal
continued.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Oh, I'm so sorry.'  Bond's voice was grave, interested.
'That's a very rare disability.  I've always been able to
understand claustrophobia, but not the other way round.
How did it come about?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger picked up his cards and began to arrange
his hand.  'I have no idea,' he said equably.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond got up.  'Well, I think I'll stretch my legs for a bit.
See what's going on in the pool.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'You do just that,' said Mr Du Pont jovially.  'Just take
it easy, James.  Plenty of time to discuss business over lunch.
I'll see if I can't dish it out to my friend Goldfinger this
time instead of taking it.  Be seeing you.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger didn't look up from his cards.  Bond strolled
down the roof, past the occasional splayed-out body, to
the rail at the far end that overlooked the pool.  For a time
he stood and contemplated the ranks of pink and brown
and white flesh laid out below him on the steamer chairs.
The heavy scent of suntan oil came up to him.  There were
a few children and young people in the pool.  A man,
obviously a professional diver, perhaps the swimming
instructor, stood on the high-dive.  He balanced on the
balls of his feet, a muscled Greek god with golden hair.
He bounced once, casually, and flew off and down, his
arms held out like wings.  Lazily they arrowed out to
cleave the water for the body to pass through.  The impact
left only a brief turbulence.  The diver jack-knifed up
again, shaking his head boyishly.  There was a smattering
of applause.  The man trudged slowly down the pool, his
head submerged, his shoulders moving with casual power.
Bond thought, good luck to you!  You won't be able to
keep this up for more than another five or six years.
High-divers couldn't take it for long—the repeated shock to the
skull.  With ski-jumping, which had the same shattering
effect on the frame, high-diving was the shortest-lived
sport.  Bond radioed to the diver, 'Cash in quick!  Get into
films while the hair's still gold.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond turned and looked back down the roof towards
the two Canasta players beneath the cliff of the hotel.  So
Goldfinger liked to face the hotel.  Or was it that he liked
Mr Du Pont to have his back to it?  And why?  Now, what
was the number of Goldfinger's suite?  No. 200, the Hawaii
Suite.  Bond's on the top floor was 1200.  So, all things being
equal, Goldfinger's would be directly below Bond's, on the
second floor, twenty yards or so above the roof of the
Cabana Club—twenty yards from the card table.  Bond
counted down.  He closely examined the frontage that
should be Goldfinger's.  Nothing.  An empty sun balcony.
An open door into the dark interior of the suite.  Bond
measured distances, angles.  Yes, that's how it might be.
That's how it must be!  Clever Mr Goldfinger!

CHAPTER FOUR
<br class="calibre6"/>
OVER THE BARREL
</h3>

<p class="calibre4">
After luncheon—the traditional shrimp cocktail,
'native' snapper with a minute paper cup of tartare
sauce, roast prime ribs of beef <i class="calibre3">au jus</i>, and pineapple
<i class="calibre3">surprise</i>—it was time for the siesta before meeting
Goldfinger at three o'clock for the afternoon session.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Du Pont, who had lost a further ten thousand
dollars or more, confirmed that Goldfinger had a secretary.
'Never seen her.  Sticks to the suite.  Probably just some
chorine he's brought down for the ride.'  He smiled wetly.
'I mean the daily ride.  Why?  You on to something?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond was non-committal.  'Can't tell yet.  I probably
won't be coming down this afternoon.  Say I got bored
watching—gone into the town.'  He paused.  'But if my
idea's right, don't be surprised at what may happen.  If
Goldfinger starts to behave oddly, just sit quiet and
watch.  I'm not promising anything.  I think I've got him,
but I may be wrong.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Du Pont was enthusiastic.  'Good for you, boyo!' he
said effusively.  'I just can't wait to see that bastard over
the barrel.  Damn his eyes!'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond took the elevator up to his suite.  He went to his
suitcase and extracted an M3 Leica, an MC exposure
meter, a K.2 filter and a flash-holder.  He put a bulb in the
holder and checked the camera.  He went to his balcony,
glanced at the sun to estimate where it would be at about
three-thirty and went back into the sitting-room, leaving
the door to the balcony open.  He stood at the balcony door
and aimed the exposure meter.  The exposure was
one-hundredth of a second.  He set this on the Leica, put the
shutter at f11, and the distance at twelve feet.  He clipped
on a lens hood and took one picture to see that all was
working.  Then he wound on the film, slipped in the
flash-holder and put the camera aside.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond went to his suitcase again and took out a thick
book—<i class="calibre3">The Bible Designed to be Read as Literature</i>—opened
it and extracted his Walther PPK in the Berns Martin
holster.  He slipped the holster inside his trouser band to
the left.  He tried one or two quick draws.  They were
satisfactory.  He closely examined the geography of his
suite, on the assumption that it would be exactly similar
to the Hawaii.  He visualized the scene that would almost
certainly greet him when he came through the door of the
suite downstairs.  He tried his pass-key in the various locks
and practised opening the doors noiselessly.  Then he
pulled a comfortable chair in front of the open balcony
door and sat and smoked a cigarette while he gazed out
across the sea and thought of how he would put things to
Goldfinger when the time came.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
At three-fifteen, Bond got up and went out on to the
balcony and cautiously looked down at the two tiny figures
across the square of green baize.  He went back into the
room and checked the exposure meter on the Leica.  The
light was the same.  He slipped on the coat of his dark blue
tropical worsted suit, straightened his tie and slung the
strap of the Leica round his neck so that the camera hung
at his chest.  Then, with a last look round, he went out and
along to the elevator.  He rode down to the ground floor
and examined the shop windows in the foyer.  When the
elevator had gone up again, he walked to the staircase and
slowly climbed up two floors.  The geography of the second
floor was identical with the twelfth.  Room 200 was where
he had expected it to be.  There was no one in sight.  He
took out his pass-key and silently opened the door and
closed it behind him.  In the small lobby, a raincoat, a
light camel-hair coat and a pale grey Homburg hung on
hooks.  Bond took his Leica firmly in his right hand, held it
up close to his face and gently tried the door to the
sitting-room.  It was not locked.  Bond eased it open.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Even before he could see what he expected to see he
could hear the voice.  It was a low, attractive, girl's voice,
an English voice.  It was saying, 'Drew five and four.
Completed canasta in fives with two twos.  Discarding
four.  Has singletons in kings, knaves, nines, sevens.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond slid into the room.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The girl was sitting on two cushions on top of a table
which had been pulled up a yard inside the open balcony
door.  She had needed the cushions to give her height.  It
was at the top of the afternoon heat and she was naked
except for a black brassière and black silk briefs.  She was
swinging her legs in a bored fashion.  She had just finished
painting the nails on her left hand.  Now she stretched
the hand out in front of her to examine the effect.  She
brought the hand back close to her lips and blew on the
nails.  Her right hand reached sideways and put the brush
back in the Revlon bottle on the table beside her.  A few
inches from her eyes were the eyepieces of a powerful-looking
pair of binoculars supported on a tripod whose
feet reached down between her sunburned legs to the
floor.  Jutting out from below the binoculars was a
microphone from which wires led to a box about the size of
a portable record player under the table.  Other wires ran
from the box to a gleaming indoor aerial on the sideboard
against the wall.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The briefs tightened as she leant forward again and
put her eyes to the binoculars.  'Drew a queen and a king.
Meld of queens.  Can meld kings with a joker.  Discarding
seven.'  She switched off the microphone.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
While she was concentrating, Bond stepped swiftly
across the floor until he was almost behind her.  There was
a chair.  He stood on it, praying it wouldn't squeak.  Now
he had the height to get the whole scene in focus.  He put
his eye to the view-finder.  Yes, there it was, all in line,
the girl's head, the edge of the binoculars, the
microphone and, twenty yards below, the two men at the table
with Mr Du Pont's hand of cards held in front of him.
Bond could distinguish the reds and the blacks.  He pressed
the button.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The sharp explosion of the bulb and the blinding flash
of light forced a quick scream out of the girl.  She swivelled
round.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond stepped down off the chair.  'Good afternoon.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Whoryou?  Whatyouwant?'  The girl's hand was up to
her mouth.  Her eyes screamed at him.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I've got what I want.  Don't worry.  It's all over now.
And my name's Bond, James Bond.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond put his camera carefully down on the chair and
came and stood in the radius of her scent.  She was very
beautiful.  She had the palest blonde hair.  It fell heavily
to her shoulders, unfashionably long.  Her eyes were deep
blue against a lightly sunburned skin and her mouth was
bold and generous and would have a lovely smile.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
She stood up and took her hand away from her mouth.
She was tall, perhaps five feet ten, and her arms and legs
looked firm as if she might be a swimmer.  Her breasts
thrust against the black silk of the brassiere.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Some of the fear had gone out of her eyes.  She said in a
low voice, 'What are you going to do?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Nothing to you.  I may tease Goldfinger a bit.  Move
over like a good girl and let me have a look.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond took the girl's place and looked through the
glasses.  The game was going on normally.  Goldfinger
showed no sign that his communications had broken down.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Doesn't he mind not getting the signals?  Will he stop
playing?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
She said hesitatingly, 'It's happened before when a
plug pulled or something.  He just waits for me to come
through again.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond smiled at her.  'Well, let's let him stew for a bit.
Have a cigarette and relax,' he held out a packet of
Chesterfields.  She took one.  'Anyway it's time you did the
nails on your right hand.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
A smile flickered across her mouth.  'How long were you
there?  You gave me a frightful shock.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Not long, and I'm sorry about the shock.  Goldfinger's
been giving poor old Mr Du Pont shocks for a whole week.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes,' she said doubtfully.  'I suppose it's really rather
mean.  But he's very rich, isn't he?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Oh yes.  I shouldn't lose any sleep over Mr Du Pont.
But Goldfinger might choose someone who can't afford it.
Anyway, he's a zillionaire himself.  Why does he do it?
He's crawling with money.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Animation flooded back into her face.  'I know.  I
simply can't understand him.  It's a sort of mania with
him, making money.  He can't leave it alone.  I've asked
him why and all he says is that one's a fool not to make
money when the odds are right.  He's always going on
about the same thing, getting the odds right.  When he
talked me into doing this,' she waved her cigarette at the
binoculars, 'and I asked him why on earth he bothered,
took these stupid risks, all he said was, "That's the second
lesson.  When the odds aren't right, make them right."'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said, 'Well, it's lucky for him I'm not Pinkertons
or the Miami Police Department.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The girl shrugged her shoulders.  'Oh, that wouldn't
worry him.  He'd just buy you off.  He can buy anyone off.
No one can resist gold.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'What do you mean?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
She said indifferently, 'He always carries a million
dollars' worth of gold about with him except when he's
going through the Customs.  Then he just carries a belt full
of gold coins round his stomach.  Otherwise it's in thin
sheets in the bottom and sides of his suitcases.  They're
really gold suitcases covered with leather.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'They must weigh a ton.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'He always travels by car, one with special springs.  And
his chauffeur is a huge man.  He carries them.  No one else
touches them.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Why does he carry around all that gold?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Just in case he needs it.  He knows that gold will buy
him anything he wants.  It's all twenty-four carat.  And
anyway he loves gold, really loves it like people love
jewels or stamps or—well,' she smiled, 'women.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond smiled back.  'Does he love you?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
She blushed and said indignantly, 'Certainly not.'  Then,
more reasonably, 'Of course you can think anything
you like.  But really he doesn't.  I mean, I think he
likes people to <i class="calibre3">think</i> that we—that I'm—that it's a
question of love and all that.  You know.  He's not very
prepossessing and I suppose it's a question of—well—of
vanity or something.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes, I see.  So you're just a kind of secretary?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Companion,' she corrected him.  'I don't have to type
or anything.'  She suddenly put her hand up to her mouth.
'Oh, but I shouldn't be telling you all this!  You won't tell
him, will you?  He'd fire me.'  Fright came into her eyes.
'Or something.  I don't know what he'd do.  He's the sort
of man who might do anything.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Of course I won't tell.  But this can't be much of a life
for you.  Why do you do it?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
She said tartly, 'A hundred pounds a week and all this,'
she waved at the room, 'doesn't grow on trees.  I save up.
When I've saved enough I shall go.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond wondered if Goldfinger would let her.  Wouldn't
she know too much?  He looked at the beautiful face, the
splendid, unselfconscious body.  She might not suspect it,
but, for his money, she was in very bad trouble with
this man.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The girl was fidgeting.  Now she said with an
embarrassed laugh, 'I don't think I'm very properly dressed.
Can't I go and put something on over these?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond wasn't sure he could trust her.  It wasn't he who
was paying the hundred pounds a week.  He said airily,
'You look fine.  Just as respectable as those hundreds of
people round the pool.  Anyway,' he stretched, 'it's about
time to light a fire under Mr Goldfinger.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond had been glancing down at the game from time to
time.  It seemed to be proceeding normally.  Bond bent
again to the binoculars.  Already Mr Du Pont seemed to be
a new man, his gestures were expansive, the half-profile of
his pink face was full of animation.  While Bond watched,
he took a fistful of cards out of his hand and spread them
down—a pure canasta in kings.  Bond tilted the
binoculars up an inch.  The big red-brown moon face was
impassive, uninterested.  Mr Goldfinger was waiting
patiently for the odds to adjust themselves back in his
favour.  While Bond watched, he put up a hand to the
hearing aid, pushing the amplifier more firmly into his
ear, ready for the signals to come through again.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond stepped back.  'Neat little machine,' he
commented.  'What are you transmitting on?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'He told me, but I can't remember.'  She screwed up her
eyes.  'A hundred and seventy somethings.  Would it be
mega-somethings?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Megacycles.  Might be, but I'd be surprised if he
doesn't get a lot of taxicabs and police messages mixed up
with your talk.  Must have fiendish concentration.'  Bond
grinned.  'Now then.  All set?  It's time to pull the rug away.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Suddenly she reached out and put a hand on his sleeve.
There was a Claddagh ring on the middle finger—two
gold hands clasped round a gold heart.  There were tears
in her voice.  'Must you?  Can't you leave him alone?  I
don't know what he'll do to me.  Please.'  She hesitated.
She was blushing furiously.  'And I like you.  It's a long
time since I've seen someone like you.  Couldn't you just
stay here for a little more?'  She looked down at the ground.
'If only you'd leave him alone I'd do—' the words came
out in a rush—'I'd do <i class="calibre3">anything</i>.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond smiled.  He took the girl's hand off his arm and
squeezed it.  'Sorry.  I'm being paid to do this job and I
must do it.  Anyway—' his voice went flat—'I want to do
it.  It's time someone cut Mr Goldfinger down to size.
Ready?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Without waiting for an answer he bent to the binoculars.
They were still focused on Goldfinger.  Bond cleared his
throat.  He watched the big face carefully.  His hand felt
for the microphone switch and pressed it down.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There must have been a whisper of static in the deaf
aid.  Goldfinger's expression didn't alter, but he slowly
raised his face to heaven and then down again, as if in
benediction.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond spoke softly, menacingly into the microphone.
'Now hear me, Goldfinger.'  He paused.  Not a flicker of
expression, but Goldfinger bent his head a fraction as if
listening.  He studied his cards intently, his hands quite still.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'This is James Bond speaking.  Remember me?  The
game's finished and it's time to pay.  I have a photograph
of the whole set-up, blonde, binoculars, microphone and
you and your hearing aid.  This photograph will not go to
the F.B.I. and Scotland Yard so long as you obey me
exactly.  Nod your head if you understand.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The face was still expressionless.  Slowly the big round
head bent forward and then straightened itself.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Put your cards down face upwards on the table.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The hands went down.  They opened and the cards slid
off the fingers on to the table.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Take out your cheque book and write a cheque to
cash for fifty thousand dollars.  That is made up as
follows, thirty-five you have taken from Mr Du Pont.
Ten for my fee.  The extra five for wasting so much of Mr
Du Pont's valuable time.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond watched to see that his order was being obeyed.
He took a glance at Mr Du Pont.  Mr Du Pont was leaning
forward, gaping.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Mr Goldfinger slowly detached the cheque and countersigned
it on the back.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Right.  Now jot this down on the back of your cheque
book and see you get it right.  Book me a compartment on
the Silver Meteor to New York tonight.  Have a bottle of
vintage champagne on ice in the compartment and plenty
of caviar sandwiches.  The best caviar.  And keep away
from me.  And no monkey business.  The photograph will
be in the mails with a full report to be opened and acted
upon if I don't show up in good health in New York
tomorrow.  Nod if you understand.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Again the big head came slowly down and up again.
Now there were traces of sweat on the high, unlined
forehead.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Right, now hand the cheque across to Mr Du Pont and
say, "I apologize humbly.  I have been cheating
you."  Then you can go.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond watched the hand go across and drop the cheque
in front of Mr Du Pont.  The mouth opened and spoke.
The eyes were placid, slow.  Goldfinger had relaxed.  It was
only money.  He had paid his way out.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Just a moment, Goldfinger, you're not through yet.'  Bond
glanced up at the girl.  She was looking at him
strangely.  There was misery and fear but also a look of
submissiveness, of longing.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'What's your name?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Jill Masterton.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger had stood up, was turning away.  Bond said
sharply, 'Stop.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Goldfinger stopped in mid-stride.  Now his eyes looked
up at the balcony.  They had opened wide, as when Bond
had first met him.  Their hard, level, X-ray gaze seemed to
find the lenses of the binoculars, travel down them and
through Bond's eyes to the back of his skull.  They seemed
to say, 'I shall remember this, Mr Bond.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said softly, 'I'd forgotten.  One last thing.  I shall
be taking a hostage for the ride to New York.  Miss
Masterton.  See that she's at the train.  Oh, and make that
compartment a drawing-room.  That's all.'

CHAPTER FIVE
<br class="calibre6"/>
NIGHT DUTY
</h3>

<p class="calibre4">
It was a week later.  Bond stood at the open window of
the seventh-floor office of the tall building in Regent's
Park that is the headquarters of the Secret Service.
London lay asleep under a full moon that rode swiftly
over the town through a shoal of herring-bone clouds.
Big Ben sounded three.  One of the telephones rang in the
dark room.  Bond turned and moved quickly to the central
desk and the pool of light cast by the green shaded
reading-lamp.  He picked up the black telephone from the
rank of four.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
He said, 'Duty officer.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Station H, sir.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Put them on.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
There was the echoing buzz and twang of the usual bad
radio connection with Hongkong.  Why were there always
sunspots over China?  A sing-song voice asked, 'Universal
Export?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
A deep, close voice—London—said, 'You're through
to Hongkong.  Speak up, please.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said impatiently, 'Clear the line, please.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The sing-song voice said, 'You're through now.  Speak
up, please.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Hullo!  Hullo!  Universal Export?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Dickson speaking.  Can you hear me?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'That cable I sent you about the shipment of mangoes.
Fruit.  You know?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes.  Got it here.'  Bond pulled the file towards him.  He
knew what it was about.  Station H wanted some limpet
mines to put paid to three Communist spy junks that
were using Macao to intercept British freighters and
search them for refugees from China.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Must have payment by the tenth.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
That would mean that the junks were leaving, or else
that the guards on the junks would be doubled after that
date, or some other emergency.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said briefly, 'Wilco.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Thanks.  'Bye.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Bye.'  Bond put down the receiver.  He picked up the
green receiver and dialled Q Branch and talked to the
section duty officer.  It would be all right.  There was a
B.O.A.C. Britannia leaving in the morning.  Q Branch
would see that the crate caught the plane.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond sat back.  He reached for a cigarette and lit it.
He thought of the badly air-conditioned little office on the
waterfront in Hongkong, saw the sweat marks on the
white shirt of 279, whom he knew well and who had just
called himself Dickson.  Now 279 would probably be
talking to his number two: 'It's okay.  London says can do.
Let's just go over this ops. schedule again.'  Bond smiled
wryly.  Better they than he.  He'd never liked being up
against the Chinese.  There were too many of them.
Station H might be stirring up a hornets' nest, but M
had decided it was time to show the opposition that the
Service in Hongkong hadn't quite gone out of business.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
When, three days before, M had first told him his name
was down for night duty, Bond hadn't taken to the idea.
He had argued that he didn't know enough about the
routine work of the stations, that it was too responsible a
job to give a man who had been in the double-O section
for six years and who had forgotten all he had ever known
about station work.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'You'll soon pick it up,' M had said unsympathetically.
'If you get in trouble there are the duty section officers
or the Chief of Staff—or me, for the matter of
that.'  (Bond had smiled at the thought of waking M up in
the middle of the night because some man in Aden or
Tokyo was in a flap.)  'Anyway, I've decided.  I want all
senior officers to do their spell of routine.'  M had looked
frostily across at Bond.  'Matter of fact, 007, I had the
Treasury on to me the other day.  Their liaison man
thinks the double-O section is redundant.  Says that kind
of thing is out of date.  I couldn't bother to argue'—M's
voice was mild.  'Just told him he was mistaken.'  (Bond
could visualize the scene.)  'However, won't do any harm
for you to have some extra duties now you're back in
London.  Keep you from getting stale.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
And Bond wasn't minding it.  He was half way through
his first week and so far it had just been a question of
common sense or passing routine problems on down to the
sections.  He rather liked the peaceful room and knowing
everybody's secrets and being occasionally fed coffee and
sandwiches by one of the pretty girls from the canteen.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
On the first night the girl had brought him tea.  Bond
had looked at her severely.  'I don't drink tea.  I hate it.
It's mud.  Moreover it's one of the main reasons for the
downfall of the British Empire.  Be a good girl and make me
some coffee.'  The girl had giggled and scurried off to
spread Bond's dictum in the canteen.  From then on he had
got his coffee.  The expression 'a cup of mud' was seeping
through the building.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
A second reason why Bond enjoyed the long vacuum
of night duty was that it gave him time to get on with a
project he had been toying with for more than a year—a
handbook of all secret methods of unarmed combat.
It was to be called <i class="calibre3">Stay Alive!</i>  It would contain the best
of all that had been written on the subject by the Secret
Services of the world.  Bond had told no one of the project,
but he hoped that, if he could finish it, M would allow
it to be added to the short list of Service manuals which
contained the tricks and techniques of Secret Intelligence.
Bond had borrowed the original textbooks, or where
necessary, translations, from Records.  Most of the books
had been captured from enemy agents or organizations.
Some had been presented to M by sister Services such as
O.S.S., C.I.A. and the Deuxième.  Now Bond drew
towards him a particular prize, a translation of the manual,
entitled simply <i class="calibre3">Defence</i>, issued to operatives of SMERSH, the
Soviet organization of vengeance and death.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
That night he was halfway through Chapter Two,
whose title, freely translated, was 'Come-along and
Restraint Holds'.  Now he went back to the book and read
for half an hour through the sections dealing with the
conventional 'Wrist Come-along', 'Arm Lock Come-along',
'Forearm Lock', 'Head Hold' and 'Use of Neck
Pressure Points'.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
After half an hour, Bond thrust the typescript away
from him.  He got up and went across to the window and
stood looking out.  There was a nauseating toughness in the
blunt prose the Russians used.  It had brought on another
of the attacks of revulsion to which Bond had succumbed
ten days before at Miami Airport.  What was wrong with
him?  Couldn't he take it any more?  Was he going soft, or
was he only stale?  Bond stood for a while watching the
moon riding, careering, through the clouds.  Then he
shrugged his shoulders and went back to his desk.  He
decided that he was as fed up with the variations of
violent physical behaviour as a psychoanalyst must
become with the mental aberrations of his patients.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond read again the passage that had revolted him: 'A
drunken woman can also usually be handled by using the
thumb and forefinger to grab the lower lip.  By pinching
hard and twisting, as the pull is made, the woman will
come along.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond grunted.  The obscene delicacy of that 'thumb and
forefinger'!  Bond lit a cigarette and stared into the
filament of the desk light, switching his mind to other things,
wishing that a signal would come in or the telephone ring.
Another five hours to go before the nine o'clock report to
the Chief of Staff or to M, if M happened to come in
early.  There was something nagging at his mind,
something he had wanted to check on when he had the time.
What was it?  What had triggered off the reminder?  Yes,
that was it, 'forefinger'—Goldfinger.  He would see if
Records had anything on the man.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond picked up the green telephone and dialled Records.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Doesn't ring a bell, sir.  I'll check and call you back.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond put down the receiver.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
It had been a wonderful trip up in the train.  They had
eaten the sandwiches and drunk the champagne and then,
to the rhythm of the giant diesels pounding out the miles,
they had made long, slow love in the narrow berth.  It had
been as if the girl was starved of physical love.  She had
woken him twice more in the night with soft demanding
caresses, saying nothing, just reaching for his hard, lean
body.  The next day she had twice pulled down the roller
blinds to shut out the hard light and had taken him by the
hand and said, 'Love me, James' as if she was a child asking
for a sweet.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Even now Bond could hear the quick silver poem of the
level-crossing bells, the wail of the big windhorn out front
and the quiet outside clamour at the stations when they
lay and waited for the sensual gallop of the wheels to
begin again.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Jill Masterton had said that Goldfinger had been relaxed,
indifferent over his defeat.  He had told the girl to
tell Bond that he would be over in England in a week's
time and would like to have that game of golf at Sandwich.
Nothing else—no threats, no curses.  He had said he would
expect the girl back by the next train.  Jill had told Bond
she would go.  Bond had argued with her.  But she was not
frightened of Goldfinger.  What could he do to her?  And
it was a good job.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond had decided to give her the ten thousand dollars
Mr Du Pont had shuffled into his hand with a stammer of
thanks and congratulations.  Bond made her take the
money.  'I don't want it,' Bond had said.  'Wouldn't know
what to do with it.  Anyway, keep it as mad money in case
you want to get away in a hurry.  It ought to be a million.
I shall never forget last night and today.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond had taken her to the station and had kissed her
once hard on the lips and had gone away.  It hadn't been
love, but a quotation had come into Bond's mind as his
cab moved out of Pennsylvania station: 'Some love is fire,
some love is rust.  But the finest, cleanest love is
lust.'  Neither had had regrets.  Had they committed a sin?  If so,
which one?  A sin against chastity?  Bond smiled to himself.
There was a quotation for that too, and from a saint—Saint
Augustine: 'Oh Lord, give me Chastity.  But don't
give it yet!'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The green telephone rang.  'Three Goldfingers, sir, but
two of them are dead.  The third's a Russian post office in
Geneva.  Got a hairdressing business.  Slips the messages
into the right-hand coat pocket when he brushes the
customers down.  He lost a leg at Stalingrad.  Any good,
sir?  There's plenty more on him.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'No thanks.  That couldn't be my man.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'We could put a trace through C.I.D. Records in the
morning.  Got a picture, sir?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond remembered the Leica film.  He hadn't even
bothered to have it developed.  It would be quicker to
mock up the man's face on the Identicast.  He said, 'Is the
Identicast room free?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes, sir.  And I can operate it for you if you like.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Thanks.  I'll come down.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond told the switchboard to let heads of sections know
where he would be and went out and took the lift down
to Records on the first floor.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The big building was extraordinarily quiet at night.
Beneath the silence, there was a soft whisper of machinery
and hidden life—the muffled clack of a typewriter as
Bond passed a door, a quickly suppressed stammer of radio
static as he passed another, the soft background whine of
the ventilation system.  It gave you the impression of being
in a battleship in harbour.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The Records duty officer was already at the controls
of the Identicast in the projection room.  He said to Bond,
'Could you give me the main lines of the face, sir?  That'll
help me leave out the slides that are obviously no good.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond did so and sat back and watched the lighted
screen.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The Identicast is a machine for building up an
approximate picture of a suspect—or of someone who has
perhaps only been glimpsed in a street or a train or in a
passing car.  It works on the magic lantern principle.  The
operator flashes on the screen various head-shapes and
sizes.  When one is recognized it stays on the screen.  Then
various haircuts are shown, and then all the other features
follow and are chosen one by one—different shapes of
eyes, noses, chins, mouths, eyebrows, cheeks, ears.  In the
end there is the whole picture of a face, as near as the
scanner can remember it, and it is photographed and put
on record.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
It took some time to put together Goldfinger's
extraordinary face, but the final result was an approximate
likeness in monochrome.  Bond dictated one or two notes
about the sunburn, the colour of the hair and the
expression of the eyes, and the job was done.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Wouldn't like to meet that on a dark night,'
commented the man from Records.  'I'll put it through to
C.I.D. when they come on duty.  You should get the
answer by lunch time.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond went back to the seventh floor.  On the other side
of the world it was around midnight.  Eastern stations were
closing down.  There was a flurry of signals that had to be
dealt with, the night's log to be written up, and then it was
eight o'clock.  Bond telephoned the canteen for his
breakfast.  He had just finished it when there came the harsh
purr of the red telephone.  M!  Why the hell had he got in
half an hour early?
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes, sir.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Come up to my office, 007.  I want to have a word before
you go off duty.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Sir.'  Bond put the telephone back.  He slipped on his
coat and ran a hand through his hair, told the switchboard
where he would be, took the night log and went up in the
lift to the eighth and top floor.  Neither the desirable
Miss Moneypenny nor the Chief of Staff was on duty.
Bond knocked on M's door and went in.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Sit down, 007.'  M was going through the pipe-lighting
routine.  He looked pink and well scrubbed.  The lined
sailor's face above the stiff white collar and loosely tied
spotted bow-tie was damnably brisk and cheerful.  Bond
was conscious of the black stubble on his own chin and of
the all-night look of his skin and clothes.  He sharpened
his mind.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Quiet night?'  M had got his pipe going.  His hard,
healthy eyes regarded Bond attentively.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Pretty quiet, sir.  Station H—'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
M raised his left hand an inch or two.  'Never mind.
I'll read all about it in the log.  Here, I'll take it.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond handed over the Top Secret folder.  M put it to
one side.  He smiled one of his rare, rather sardonic, bitten-off
smiles.  'Things change, 007.  I'm taking you off night
duty for the present.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond's answering smile was taut.  He felt the quickening
of the pulse he had so often experienced in this room.  M
had got something for him.  He said, 'I was just getting
into it, sir.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Quite.  Have plenty of opportunity later on.  Something's
come up.  Odd business.  Not really your line of country,
except for one particular angle which'—M jerked his
pipe sideways in a throwaway gesture—'may not be an
angle at all.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond sat back.  He said nothing, waiting.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Had dinner with the Governor of the Bank last night.
One's always hearing something new.  At least, all this was
new to me.  Gold—the seamy side of the stuff.  Smuggling,
counterfeiting, all that.  Hadn't occurred to me that the
Bank of England knew so much about crooks.  Suppose it's
part of the Bank's job to protect our currency.'  M jerked
his eyebrows up.  'Know anything about gold?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'No, sir.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Well, you will by this afternoon.  You've got an
appointment with a man called Colonel Smithers at the Bank at
four o'clock.  That give you enough time to get some sleep?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Yes, sir.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Good.  Seems that this man Smithers is head of the
Bank's research department.  From what the Governor
told me, that's nothing more or less than a spy system.
First time I knew they had one.  Just shows what water-tight
compartments we all work in.  Anyway, Smithers and
his chaps keep an eye out for anything fishy in the banking
world—particularly any monkeying about with our
currency and bullion reserves and what not.  There was
that business the other day of the Italians who were
counterfeiting sovereigns.  Making them out of real gold.
Right carats and all that.  But apparently a sovereign or a
French napoleon is worth much more than its melted-down
value in gold.  Don't ask me why.  Smithers can tell
you that if you're interested.  Anyway, the Bank went after
these people with a whole battery of lawyers—it wasn't
technically a criminal offence—and, after losing in the
Italian courts, they finally nailed them in Switzerland.
You probably read about it.  Then there was that business
of dollar balances in Beirut.  Made quite a stir in the
papers.  Couldn't understand it myself.  Some crack in the
fence we put round our currency.  The wide City boys had
found it.  Well, it's Smithers's job to smell out that kind of
racket.  The reason the Governor told me all this is because
for years, almost since the war apparently, Smithers has
had a bee in his bonnet about some big gold leak out of
England.  Mostly deduction, plus some kind of instinct.
Smithers admits he's got damned little to go on, but he's
impressed the Governor enough for him to get permission
from the P.M. to call us in.'  M broke off.  He looked
quizzically at Bond.  'Ever wondered who are the richest
men in England?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'No, sir.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Well, have a guess.  Or rather, put it like this: Who are
the richest Englishmen?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond searched his mind.  There were a lot of men who
sounded rich or who were made to sound rich by the
newspapers.  But who really had it, liquid, in the bank?
He had to say something.  He said hesitatingly, 'Well, sir,
there's Sassoon.  Then that shipping man who keeps to
himself—er—Ellerman.  They say Lord Cowdray is very
rich.  There are the bankers—Rothschilds, Barings,
Hambros.  There was Williamson, the diamond man.
Oppenheimer in South Africa.  Some of the dukes may still
have a lot of money.'  Bond's voice trailed away.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Not bad.  Not bad at all.  But you've missed out the
joker in the pack.  Man I'd never thought of until the
Governor brought up his name.  He's the richest of the lot.
Man called Goldfinger, Auric Goldfinger.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond couldn't help himself.  He laughed sharply.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'What's the matter?'  M's voice was testy.  'What the hell
is there to laugh about?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I'm sorry, sir.'  Bond got hold of himself.  'The truth is,
only last night I was building his face up on the Identicast.'  He
glanced at his watch.  In a strangled voice he said, 'Be
on its way to C.I.D. Records.  Asked for a Trace on him.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
M was getting angry.  'What the hell's all this about?
Stop behaving like a bloody schoolboy.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said soberly, 'Well, sir, it's like this...'  Bond told
the story, leaving nothing out.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
M's face cleared.  He listened with all his attention,
leaning forward across the desk.  When Bond had finished,
M sat back in his chair.  He said 'Well, well ... well' on a
diminishing scale.  He put his hands behind his head and
gazed for minutes at the ceiling.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond could feel the laughter coming on again.  How
would the C.I.D. word the resounding snub he would get
in the course of the day?  He was brought sharply back to
earth by M's next words.  'By the way, what happened to
that ten thousand dollars?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Gave it to the girl, sir.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Really!  Why not to the White Cross?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The White Cross Fund was for the families of Secret
Service men and women who were killed on duty.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Sorry, sir.'  Bond was not prepared to argue that one.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Humpf.'  M had never approved of Bond's womanizing.
It was anathema to his Victorian soul.  He decided to let
it pass.  He said, 'Well, that's all for now, 007.  You'll be
hearing all about it this afternoon.  Funny about
Goldfinger.  Odd chap.  Seen him once or twice at Blades.  He
plays bridge there when he's in England.  He's the chap
the Bank of England's after.'  M paused.  He looked mildly
across the table at Bond.  'As from this moment, so are you.'

<h3 class="calibre8">
CHAPTER SIX
<br class="calibre6"/>
TALK OF GOLD
</h3>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond walked up the steps and through the fine bronze
portals and into the spacious, softly echoing entrance
hall of the Bank of England and looked around him.
Under his feet glittered the brilliant golden patterns of
the Boris Anrep mosaics; beyond, through twenty-foot-high
arched windows, green grass and geraniums blazed
in the central courtyard.  To right and left were spacious
vistas of polished Hopton Wood stone.  Over all hung
the neutral smell of air-conditioned air and the heavy,
grave atmosphere of immense riches.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
One of the athletic-looking, pink frock-coated
commissionaires came up to him.  'Yes, sir?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Colonel Smithers?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Commander Bond, sir?  This way please.'  The
commissionaire moved off to the right between the pillars.  The
bronze doors of a discreetly hidden lift stood open.  The
lift rose a few feet to the first floor.  Now there was a long
panelled corridor ending in a tall Adams window.  The
floor was close-carpeted in beige Wilton.  The commissionaire
knocked at the last of several finely carved oak
doors that were just so much taller and more elegant than
ordinary doors.  A grey-haired woman was sitting at a
desk.  She looked as if she had once taken a double first.
The walls of the room were lined with grey metal filing
cabinets.  The woman had been writing on a quarto pad of
yellow memorandum paper.  She smiled with a hint of
conspiracy, picked up a telephone and dialled a number.
'Commander Bond is here.'  She put the telephone back
and stood up.  'Will you come this way?'  She crossed the
room to a door covered with green baize and held it open
for Bond to go through.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Colonel Smithers had risen from his desk.  He said
gravely, 'Nice of you to have come.  Won't you sit
down?'  Bond took the chair.  'Smoke?'  Colonel Smithers pushed
forward a silver box of Senior Service and himself sat down
and began to fill a pipe.  Bond took a cigarette and lit it.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Colonel Smithers looked exactly like someone who
would be called Colonel Smithers.  He had obviously been
a colonel, probably on the staff, and he had the smooth,
polished, basically serious mien that fitted his name.  But
for his horn-rimmed glasses, he might have been an
efficient, not very well-fed courtier in a royal household.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond felt boredom gathering in the corners of the room.
He said encouragingly, 'It seems that you are to tell me
all about gold.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'So I understand.  I had a note from the Governor.  I
gather I need keep nothing from you.  Of course you
understand'—Colonel Smithers looked over Bond's right
shoulder—'that most of what I shall have to say will be
confidential.'  The eyes swept quickly across Bond's face.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond's face was stony.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Colonel Smithers felt the silence that Bond had intended
he should feel.  He looked up, saw that he had put his foot
in it, and tried to make amends.  'Obviously I needn't have
mentioned the point.  A man with your training...'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said, 'We all think our own secrets are the only
ones that matter.  You're probably right to remind me.
Other people's secrets are never quite as important as
one's own.  But you needn't worry.  I shall discuss things
with my chief but with no one else.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Quite, quite.  Nice of you to take it that way.  In the
Bank one gets into the habit of being over-discreet.  Now
then,' Colonel Smithers scurried for cover into his subject.
'This business of gold.  I take it it's not a matter you've
thought about a great deal?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I know it when I see it.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Aha, yes—well now, the great thing to remember
about gold is that it's the most valuable and most easily
marketable commodity in the world.  You can go to any
town in the world, almost to any village, and hand over a
piece of gold and get goods or services in exchange.
Right?'  Colonel Smithers's voice had taken on a new briskness.
His eyes were alight.  He had his lecture pat.  Bond sat
back.  He was prepared to listen to anyone who was master
of his subject, any subject.  'And the next thing to
remember,' Colonel Smithers held up his pipe in warning, 'is that
gold is virtually untraceable.  Sovereigns have no serial
numbers.  If gold bars have Mint marks stamped on them
the marks can be shaved off or the bar can be melted
down and made into a new bar.  That makes it almost
impossible to check on the whereabouts of gold, or its
origins, or its movements round the world.  In England,
for instance, we at the Bank can only count the gold in our
own vaults, in the vaults of other banks and at the Mint,
and make a rough guess at the amounts held by the
jewellery trade and the pawnbroking fraternity.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Why are you so anxious to know how much gold there is
in England?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Because gold and currencies backed by gold are the
foundation of our international credit.  We can only tell
what the true strength of the pound is, and other countries
can only tell it, by knowing the amount of valuta we have
behind our currency.  And my main job, Mr Bond'—Colonel
Smithers's bland eyes had become unexpectedly
sharp—'is to watch for any leakage of gold out of
England—out of anywhere in the sterling area.  And when
I spot a leakage, an escape of gold towards some country
where it can be exchanged more profitably than at our
official buying price, it is my job to put the C.I.D. Gold
Squad on to the fugitive gold and try to get it back into
our vaults, plug the leak and arrest the people responsible.
And the trouble is, Mr Bond'—Colonel Smithers gave a
forlorn shrug of the shoulders—'that gold attracts the
biggest, the most ingenious criminals.  They are very hard,
very hard indeed, to catch.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Isn't all this only a temporary phase?  Why should this
shortage of gold go on?  They seem to be digging it out of
Africa fast enough.  Isn't there enough to go round?  Isn't
it just like any other black market that disappears when
the supplies are stepped up, like the penicillin traffic after
the war?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I'm afraid not, Mr Bond.  It isn't quite as easy as that.
The population of the world is increasing at the rate of
five thousand four hundred every hour of the day.  A small
percentage of those people become gold hoarders, people
who are frightened of currencies, who like to bury some
sovereigns in the garden or under the bed.  Another
percentage needs gold fillings for their teeth.  Others need
gold-rimmed spectacles, jewellery, engagement rings.  All
these new people will be taking tons of gold off the market
every year.  New industries need gold wire, gold plating,
amalgams of gold.  Gold has extraordinary properties
which are being put to new uses every day.  It is brilliant,
malleable, ductile, almost unalterable and more dense
than any of the common metals except platinum.  There's
no end to its uses.  But it has two defects.  It isn't hard
enough.  It wears out quickly, leaves itself on the linings of
our pockets and in the sweat of our skins.  Every year, the
world's stock is invisibly reduced by friction.  I said that
gold has two defects.'  Colonel Smithers looked sad.  'The
other and by far the major defect is that it is the talisman
of fear.  Fear, Mr Bond, takes gold out of circulation and
hoards it against the evil day.  In a period of history when
every tomorrow may be the evil day, it is fair enough to
say that a fat proportion of the gold that is dug out of one
corner of the earth is at once buried again in another
corner.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond smiled at Colonel Smithers's eloquence.  This man
lived gold, thought gold, dreamed gold.  Well, it was an
interesting subject.  He might just as well wallow in the
stuff.  In the days when Bond had been after the diamond
smugglers he had had first to educate himself in the
fascination, the myth of the stones.  He said, 'What else
ought I to know before we get down to your immediate
problem?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'You're not bored?  Well, you were suggesting that gold
production was so vast nowadays that it ought to take care
of all these various consumers.  Unfortunately that is not
so.  In fact the gold content of the world is being worked
out.  You may think that large areas of the world have still
to be explored for gold.  You would be mistaken.  Broadly
speaking, there only remains the land under the sea and
the sea itself, which has a notable gold content.  People
have been scratching the surface of the world for gold for
thousands of years.  There were the great gold treasures of
Egypt and Mycenae, Montezuma and the Incas.  Croesus
and Midas emptied the Middle Eastern territories of gold.
Europe was worked for it—the valleys of the Rhine and
the Po, Malaga and the plains of Granada.  Cyprus was
emptied, and the Balkans.  India got the fever.  Ants coming
up from under the earth carrying grains of gold led the
Indians to their alluvial fields.  The Romans worked Wales
and Devon and Cornwall.  In the Middle Ages there were
the finds in Mexico and Peru.  These were followed by the
opening up of the Gold Coast, then called Negro-land, and
after that came the Americas.  The famous gold rushes of
the Yukon and Eldorado, and the rich strikes at Eureka
sounded off the first modern Gold Age.  Meanwhile, in
Australia, Bendigo and Ballarat had come into production,
and the Russian deposits at Lena and in the Urals were
making Russia the largest gold producer in the world in
the middle of the nineteenth century.  Then came the
second modern Gold Age—the discoveries on the
Witwatersrand.  These were helped by the new method of
cyaniding instead of separation of the gold from the rock
by mercury.  Today we are in the third Gold Age with the
opening up of the Orange Free State deposits.'  Colonel
Smithers threw up his hands.  'Now, gold is pouring out of
the earth.  Why, the whole production of the Klondike and
the Homestake and Eldorado, which were once the
wonder of the world, would only add up to two or three years
of today's production from Africa!  Just to show you, from
1500 to 1900, when approximate figures were kept, the
whole world produced about eighteen thousand tons of
gold.  From 1900 to today we have dug up forty-one
thousand tons!  At this rate, Mr Bond,' Colonel Smithers
leaned forward earnestly,'—and please don't quote me—but
I wouldn't be surprised if in fifty years' time we have
not totally exhausted the gold content of the earth!'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond, smothered by this cataract of gold history, found
no difficulty in looking as grave as Colonel Smithers.  He
said, 'You certainly make a fascinating story of it.  Perhaps
the position isn't as bad as you think.  They're already
mining oil under the sea.  Perhaps they'll find a way of
mining gold.  Now, about this smuggling.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The telephone rang.  Colonel Smithers impatiently
snatched up the receiver.  'Smithers speaking.'  He
listened, irritation growing on his face.  'I'm sure I sent you
a note about the summer fixtures, Miss Philby.  The next
match is on Saturday against the Discount Houses.'  He
listened again.  'Well, if Mrs Flake won't play goals, I'm
afraid she'll have to stand down.  It's the only position on
the field we've got for her.  Everybody can't play centre
forward.  Yes, please do.  Say I'll be greatly obliged if just
this once.  I'm sure she'll be very good—right figure and
all that.  Thank you, Miss Philby.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Colonel Smithers took out a handkerchief and mopped
his forehead.  'Sorry about that.  Sports and welfare are
becoming almost too much of a fetish at the Bank.  I've
just had the women's hockey team thrown into my lap.
As if I hadn't got enough to do with the annual gymkhana
coming on.  However—'  Colonel Smithers waved these
minor irritations aside—'as you say, time to get on to the
smuggling.  Well, to begin with, and taking only England
and the sterling area, it's a very big business indeed.  We
employ three thousand staff at the Bank, Mr Bond, and
of those no less than one thousand work in the exchange
control department.  Of those at least five hundred,
including my little outfit, are engaged in controlling the
illicit movements of valuta, the attempts to smuggle or to
evade the Exchange Control Regulations.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'That's a lot.'  Bond measured it against the Secret
Service which had a total force of two thousand.  'Can you
give me an example of smuggling?  In gold.  I can't
understand these dollar swindles.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'All right.'  Colonel Smithers now talked in the soft,
tired voice of an overworked man in the service of his
Government.  It was the voice of the specialist in a
particular line of law enforcement.  It said that he knew most
things connected with that line and that he could make a
good guess at all the rest.  Bond knew the voice well, the
voice of the first-class Civil Servant.  Despite his prosiness,
Bond was beginning to take to Colonel Smithers.  'All
right.  Supposing you have a bar of gold in your pocket
about the size of a couple of packets of Players.  Weight
about five and a quarter pounds.  Never mind for the
moment where you got it from—stole it or inherited it or
something.  That'll be twenty-four carat—what we call
a thousand fine.  Now, the law says you have to sell that to
the Bank of England at the controlled price of twelve
pounds ten per ounce.  That would make it worth around
a thousand pounds.  But you're greedy.  You've got a
friend going to India or perhaps you're on good terms
with an airline pilot or a steward on the Far East run.
All you have to do is cut your bar into thin sheets or
plates—you'd soon find someone to do this for you—and sew
the plates—they'd be smaller than playing cards—into a
cotton belt, and pay your friend a commission to wear it.
You could easily afford a hundred pounds for the job.
Your friend flies off to Bombay and goes to the first bullion
dealer in the bazaar.  He will be given one thousand seven
hundred pounds for your five-pound bar and you're a
richer man than you might have been.  Mark you,'
Colonel Smithers waved his pipe airily, 'that's only seventy
per cent profit.  Just after the war you could have got three
hundred per cent.  If you'd done only half a dozen little
operations like that every year you'd be able to retire
by now.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Why the high price in India?'  Bond didn't really want
to know.  He thought M might ask him.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'It's a long story.  Briefly, India is shorter of gold,
particularly for her jewellery trade, than any other
country.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'What's the size of this traffic?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Huge.  To give you an idea, the Indian Intelligence
Bureau and their Customs <i class="calibre3">captured</i> forty-three thousand
ounces in 1955.  I doubt if that's one per cent of the traffic.
Gold's been coming into India from all points of the
compass.  Latest dodge is to fly it in from Macao and drop
it by parachute to a reception committee—a ton at a
time—like we used to drop supplies to the Resistance
during the war.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'I see.  Is there anywhere else I can get a good premium
for my gold bar?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'You could get a small premium in most countries—Switzerland,
for instance—but it wouldn't be worth your
while.  India's still the place.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'All right,' said Bond.  'I think I've got the picture.
Now what's your particular problem?'  He sat back and lit
a cigarette.  He was greatly looking forward to hearing
about Mr Auric Goldfinger.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Colonel Smithers's eyes took on their hard, foxy look.
He said, 'There's a man who came over to England in
1937.  He was a refugee from Riga.  Name of Auric
Goldfinger.  He was only twenty when he arrived, but he must
have been a bright lad because he smelled that the
Russians would be swallowing his country pretty soon.  He was
a jeweller and goldsmith by trade, like his father and
grandfather who had refined gold for Fabergé.  He had a
little money and probably one of those belts of gold I was
telling you about.  Stole it from his father, I daresay.  Well,
soon after he'd been naturalized—he was a harmless sort
of chap and in a useful trade and he had no difficulty in
getting his papers—he started buying up small
pawnbrokers all over the country.  He put in his own men, paid
them well and changed the name of the shops to
"Goldfinger".  Then he turned the shops over to selling cheap
jewellery and buying old gold—you know the sort of
place: "Best Prices for Old Gold.  Nothing too Large,
Nothing too Small", and he had his own particular slogan:
"Buy Her Engagement Ring With Grannie's Locket."  Goldfinger
did very well.  Always chose good sites, just on
the dividing line between the well-to-do streets and the
lower-middle.  Never touched stolen goods and got a good
name everywhere with the police.  He lived in London and
toured his shops once a month and collected all the old
gold.  He wasn't interested in the jewellery side.  He let his
managers run that as they liked.'  Colonel Smithers looked
quizzically at Bond.  'You may think these lockets and gold
crosses and things are pretty small beer.  So they are, but
they mount up if you've got twenty little shops, each one
buying perhaps half a dozen bits and pieces every week.
Well, the war came and Goldfinger, like all other jewellers,
had to declare his stock of gold.  I looked up his figure in
our old records.  It was fifty ounces for the whole chain!—just
enough of a working stock to keep his shops supplied
with ring settings and so forth, what they call jewellers'
findings in the trade.  Of course, he was allowed to keep it.
He tucked himself away in a machine-tool firm in Wales
during the war—well out of the firing line—but kept as
many of his shops operating as he could.  Must have done
well out of the G.I.s who generally travel with a Gold
Eagle or a Mexican fifty-dollar piece as a last reserve.
Then, when peace broke out, Goldfinger got moving.  He
bought himself a house, pretentious sort of place, at
Reculver, at the mouth of the Thames.  He also invested in
a well-found Brixham trawler and an old Silver Ghost
Rolls Royce—armoured car, built for some South
American president who was killed before he could take
delivery.  He set up a little factory called "Thanet Alloy
Research" in the grounds of his house and staffed it with
a German metallurgist, a prisoner of war who didn't want
to go back to Germany, and half a dozen Korean stevedores
he picked up in Liverpool.  They didn't know a word
of any civilized language so they weren't any security risk.
Then, for ten years, all we know is that he made one trip a
year to India in his trawler and a few trips in his car every
year to Switzerland.  Set up a subsidiary of his alloy
company near Geneva.  He kept his shops going.  Gave up
collecting the old gold himself—used one of his Koreans
whom he had taught to drive a car.  All right, perhaps
Mr Goldfinger is not a very honest man, but he behaves
himself and keeps in well with the police, and with much
more blatant fiddling going on all over the country nobody
paid him any attention.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Colonel Smithers broke off.  He looked apologetically
at Bond.  'I'm not boring you?  I do want you to get the
picture of the sort of man this is—quiet, careful,
law-abiding and with the sort of drive and single-mindedness
we all admire.  We didn't even hear of him until he suffered
a slight misfortune.  In the summer of 1954, his trawler,
homeward bound from India, went ashore on the
Goodwins and he sold the wreck for a song to the Dover
Salvage Company.  When this company started breaking
the ship up and got as far as the hold they found the
timbers impregnated with a sort of brown powder which
they couldn't put a name to.  They sent a specimen to a
local chemist.  They were surprised when he said the stuff
was gold.  I won't bother you with the formula, but you see
gold can be made to dissolve in a mixture of hydrochloric
and nitric acids, and reducing agents—sulphur dioxide
or oxalic acid—precipitate the metal as a brown powder.
This powder can be reconstituted into gold ingots by
melting at around a thousand degrees Centrigade.  Have
to watch the chlorine gas, but otherwise it's a simple
process.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'The usual nosey parker in the salvage firm gossiped to
one of the Dover Customs men and in due course a report
filtered up through the police and the C.I.D. to me,
together with a copy of the cargo clearance papers for each
of Goldfinger's trips to India.  These gave all the cargoes
as mineral dust base for crop fertilizers—all perfectly
credible because these modern fertilizers do use traces of
various minerals in their make-up.  The whole picture was
clear as crystal.  Goldfinger had been refining down his old
gold, precipitating it into this brown powder and shipping
it to India as fertilizer.  But could we pin it on him?  We
could not.  Had a quiet look at his bank balance and tax
returns.  Twenty thousand pounds at Barclays in
Ramsgate.  Income tax and super tax paid promptly each year.
Figures showed the natural progress of a well-run
jewellery business.  We dressed a couple of the Gold Squad up
and sent them down to knock on the door of Mr Goldfinger's
factory at Reculver.  "Sorry, sir, routine inspection
for the Small Engineering Section of the Ministry of
Labour.  We have to make sure the Factory Acts are being
observed for safety and health."  "Come in.  Come in."  Mr
Goldfinger positively welcomed them.  Mark you, he
may have been tipped off by his bank manager or someone,
but that factory was entirely devoted to designing a
cheap alloy for jewellers' findings—trying out unusual
metals like aluminium and tin instead of the usual copper
and nickel and palladium that are used in gold alloys.
There were traces of gold about, of course, and furnaces to
heat up to two thousand degrees and so forth, but after all
Goldfinger was a jeweller and a smelter in a small way,
and all this was perfectly above-board.  The Gold Squad
retired discomfited, our legal department decided the
brown dust in the trawler's timbers was not enough to
prosecute on without supporting evidence, and that was
more or less that, except'—Colonel Smithers slowly
wagged the stem of his pipe—'that I kept the file open
and started sniffing around the banks of the world.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Colonel Smithers paused.  The rumble of the City came
through the half-open window high up in the wall behind
his chair.  Bond glanced surreptitiously at his watch.
Five o'clock.  Colonel Smithers got up from his chair.  He
placed both hands palm downwards on the desk and leant
forward.  'It took me five years, Mr Bond, to find out that
Mr Goldfinger, in ready money, is the richest man in
England.  In Zürich, in Nassau, in Panama, in New
York, he has twenty million pounds' worth of gold bars
on safe deposit.  And those bars, Mr Bond, are not Mint
bars.  They don't carry any official marks of origin
whatsoever.  They're bars that Mr Goldfinger has melted
himself.  I flew to Nassau and had a look at the five million
pounds' worth or so he holds there in the vaults of the
Royal Bank of Canada.  Oddly enough, like all artists, he
couldn't refrain from signing his handiwork.  It needs a
microscope to see it, but somewhere, on each Goldfinger
bar, a minute letter Z has been scratched in the metal.
And that gold, or most of it, belongs to England.  The
Bank can do nothing about it, so we are asking you to
bring Mr Goldfinger to book, Mr Bond, and get that gold
back.  You know about the currency crisis and the high
bank rate?  Of course.  Well, England needs that gold,
badly—and the quicker the better.'

<h3 class="calibre8">
CHAPTER SEVEN
<br class="calibre6"/>
THOUGHTS IN A D.B.III
</h3>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond followed Colonel Smithers to the lift.  While
they waited for it, Bond glanced out of the tall
window at the end of the passage.  He was looking
down into the deep well of the back courtyard of the
Bank.  A trim chocolate-brown lorry with no owner's name
had come into the courtyard through the triple steel gates.
Square cardboard boxes were being unloaded from it and
put on to a short conveyor belt that disappeared into the
bowels of the Bank.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Colonel Smithers came over.  'Fivers,' he commented.
'Just come up from our printing works at Loughton.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The lift came and they got in.  Bond said, 'I'm not very
impressed by the new ones.  They look like any other
country's money.  The old ones were the most beautiful
money in the world.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
They walked across the entrance hall, now dimly lit
and deserted.  Colonel Smithers said, 'As a matter of fact
I agree with you.  Trouble was that those Reichsbank
forgeries during the war were a darn sight too good.
When the Russians captured Berlin, amongst the loot they
got hold of the plates.  We asked the Narodni Bank for
them, but they refused to give them up.  We and the
Treasury decided it was just too dangerous.  At any
moment, if Moscow had been inclined, they could have
started a major raid on our currency.  We had to withdraw
the old fivers.  The new ones aren't much to look at, but
at least they'd be hell to forge.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The night guard let them out on to the steps.  Threadneedle
Street was almost deserted.  The long City night
was beginning.  Bond said goodbye to Colonel Smithers
and walked along to the Tube.  He had never thought very
much about the Bank of England, but now that he had
been inside the place he decided that the Old Lady of
Threadneedle Street might be old but she still had some
teeth left in her head.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond had been told to report back to M at six.  He did
so.  M's face was no longer pink and shining.  The long day
had knocked it about, stressed it, shrunken it.  When Bond
went in and took the chair across the desk, he noticed the
conscious effort M made to clear his mind, cope with
the new problem the day was to fling at him.  M straightened
himself in his chair and reached for his pipe.  'Well?'  Bond
knew the false belligerence of that particular
bark.  He told the gist of the story in less than five minutes.
When he had finished, M said thoughtfully, 'Suppose
we've got to take it on.  Don't understand a thing about
the pound and bank rate and all that but everyone seems
to be taking it damned seriously.  Personally I should have
thought the strength of the pound depended on how hard
we all worked rather than how much gold we'd got.
Germans didn't have much gold after the war.  Look
where they've got in ten years.  However, that's probably
too easy an answer for the politicians—or more likely too
difficult.  Got any ideas how to tackle this chap
Goldfinger?  Any way of getting closer to him, offering to do
some dirty work for him or something like that?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said thoughtfully, 'I wouldn't get anywhere
sucking up to him, asking him for a job or something of that
sort, sir.  I should say he's the sort of man who only
respects people who are tougher or smarter than he is.  I've
given him one beating and the only message I got from
him was that he'd like me to play golf with him.  Perhaps
I'd better do just that.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Fine way for one of my top men to spend his time.'  The
sarcasm in M's voice was weary, resigned.  'All right.
Go ahead.  But if what you say is right, you'd better see
that you beat him.  What's your cover story?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond shrugged.  'I hadn't thought, sir.  Perhaps I'd
better be thinking of leaving Universal Export.  No future
in it.  Having a holiday while I look round.  Thinking of
emigrating to Canada.  Fed up here.  Something like that.
But perhaps I'd better play it the way the cards fall.  I
wouldn't think he's an easy man to fool.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'All right.  Report progress.  And don't think I'm not
interested in this case.'  M's voice had changed.  So had his
expression.  His eyes had become urgent, commanding.
'Now I'll give you one piece of information the Bank didn't
give you.  It just happens that I also know what Mr
Goldfinger's gold bars look like.  As a matter of fact I was
handling one today—scratched Z and all.  It had come in
with that haul we made last week when the Redland
Resident Director's office "caught fire" in Tangier.
You'll have seen the signals.  Well, that's the twentieth of
these particular gold bars that have come our way since
the war.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond interrupted, 'But that Tangier bar was out of the
SMERSH safe.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Exactly.  I've checked.  All the other nineteen bars with
the scratched Z have been taken from SMERSH operatives.'  M
paused.  He said mildly, 'D'you know, 007, I wouldn't
be at all surprised if Goldfinger doesn't turn out to be the
foreign banker, the treasurer so to speak, of SMERSH.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4"><br class="calibre1"/></p>

<p class="calibre4">
James Bond flung the D.B.III through the last mile of
straight and did a racing change down into third and then
into second for the short hill before the inevitable traffic
crawl through Rochester.  Leashed in by the velvet claw of
the front discs, the engine muttered its protest with a
mild back-popple from the twin exhausts.  Bond went up
into third again, beat the lights at the bottom of the hill
and slid resignedly up to the back of the queue that would
crawl on for a quarter of an hour—if he was lucky—through
the sprawl of Rochester and Chatham.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond settled back into second and let the car idle.  He
reached for the wide gunmetal case of Morland cigarettes
on the neighbouring bucket seat, fumbled for one and lit it
from the dashboard.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
He had chosen the A2 in preference to the A20 to
Sandwich because he wanted to take a quick look at
Goldfinger-land—Reculver and those melancholy
forsaken reaches of the Thames which Goldfinger had
chosen for his parish.  He would then cross the Isle of
Thanet to Ramsgate and leave his bag at the Channel
Packet, have an early lunch and be off to Sandwich.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The car was from the pool.  Bond had been offered the
Aston Martin or a Jaguar 3.4.  He had taken the D.B.III.
Either of the cars would have suited his cover—a well-to-do,
rather adventurous young man with a taste for the
good, the fast things of life.  But the D.B.III had the
advantage of an up-to-date triptyque, an inconspicuous
colour—battleship grey—and certain extras which might
or might not come in handy.  These included switches to
alter the type and colour of Bond's front and rear lights if
he was following or being followed at night, reinforced
steel bumpers, fore and aft, in case he needed to ram, a
long-barrelled Colt .45 in a trick compartment under the
driver's seat, a radio pick-up tuned to receive an apparatus
called the Homer, and plenty of concealed space that
would fox most Customs men.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond saw a chance and picked up fifty yards, sliding
into a ten-yard gap left by a family saloon of slow reactions.
The man at the wheel, who wore that infallible badge of
the bad driver, a hat clamped firmly on the exact centre of
his head, hooted angrily.  Bond reached out of the window
and raised an enigmatically clenched fist.  The hooting
stopped.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
And now what about this theory of M's?  It made sense.
The Russians were notoriously incompetent payers of their
men.  Their centres were always running out of
funds—their men complaining to Moscow that they couldn't
afford a square meal.  Perhaps SMERSH couldn't get the
valuta out of the Ministry of Home Security.  Or perhaps
the Ministry of Home Security couldn't get the money
out of the Ministry of Finance.  But it had always been the
same—endless money troubles that resulted in missed
chances, broken promises and waste of dangerous radio
time.  It would make sense to have a clever financial brain
somewhere outside Russia who could not only transmit
funds to the centres but also, in this case, make profits
large enough to run the SMERSH centres abroad without
any financial assistance from Moscow.  Not only that.  On
the side, Goldfinger was appreciably damaging the
currency base of an enemy country.  If all this was correct,
it was typical of SMERSH—a brilliant scheme, faultlessly
operated by an outstanding man.  And that, reflected Bond
as he roared up the hill into Chatham, putting half a
dozen cars behind him, would partly explain Goldfinger's
greed for more and still more money.  Devotion to the
cause, to SMERSH, and perhaps the dangled prize of an
Order of Lenin, would be the spur to pick up even ten or
twenty thousand dollars when the odds were right or
could be favourably adjusted.  The funds for Red
Revolution, for the discipline by fear that was the particular
speciality of SMERSH, could never be big enough.
Goldfinger was not making the money for himself.  He was
making it for the conquest of the world!  The minor risk of
being found out, as he had been by Bond, was nothing.
Why?  What could the Bank of England get him if every
single one of his past operations could be exposed?  Two
years?  Three?
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The traffic was thinning through the outskirts of
Gillingham.  Bond started motoring again, but easily now,
not hurrying, following his thoughts as the hands and feet
went through their automatic responses.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
So, in 'thirty-seven, SMERSH must have sent Goldfinger out
with the belt of gold round his young waist.  He had shown
his special aptitudes, his acquisitive bent, during his
training in the spy school in Leningrad.  He would have been
told there would be a war, that he must dig himself in and
start quietly accumulating.  Goldfinger must never dirty
his hands, never meet an agent, never receive or pass a
message.  Some routine would have been arranged.
'Second-hand '39 Vauxhall.  First offer of £1000 secures',
'Immaculate Rover, £2000', 'Bentley, £5000'.  Always an
advertisement that would not attract attention or
correspondence.  The prices would be just too high, the
description inadequate.  In the Agony column of <i class="calibre3">The
Times</i>, perhaps.  And, obediently, Goldfinger would leave
the two thousand pounds or the five thousand pounds gold
bar at one of a long, a very long series of post-boxes that
had been arranged in Moscow before he left.  A particular
bridge, a hollow tree, under a rock in a stream
somewhere, anywhere in England.  And he would never, on
any account, visit that post-box again.  It was up to
Moscow to see that the agent got to the hidden treasure.  Later,
after the war, when Goldfinger was blossoming out, when
he had become a big man, the post-boxes would no longer
be bridges and trees.  Now he would be given dates and
safety deposit box numbers, left-luggage lockers at
stations.  But still there would be the rule that Goldfinger
must never revisit the scene, never endanger himself.
Perhaps he would only get his instructions once a year, at
a casual meeting in some park, in a letter slipped into his
pocket on a train journey.  But always it would be bars of
gold, anonymous, untraceable if captured—except for
the tiny Z that his vanity had scratched on his handiwork
and that a dull dog at the Bank of England called Colonel
Smithers had happened upon in the course of his duties.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Now Bond was running through the endless orchards of
the Faversham growers.  The sun had come out from
behind the smog of London.  There was the distant gleam of
the Thames on his left.  There was traffic on the
river—long, glistening tankers, stubby merchantmen,
antediluvian Dutch Schuyts.  Bond left the Canterbury road
and switched on to the incongruously rich highway that
runs through the cheap bungaloid world of the holiday
lands—Whitstable, Herne Bay, Birchington, Margate.
He still idled along at fifty, holding the racing wheel on a
light rein, listening to the relaxed purr of the exhausts,
fitting the bits of his thoughts into the jigsaw as he had
done two nights before with Goldfinger's face on the
Identicast.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
And, Bond reflected, while Goldfinger was pumping a
million, two million pounds a year into the bloody maw of
SMERSH, he was pyramiding his reserves, working on them,
making them work for him whenever the odds were right,
piling up the surplus for the day when the trumpets would
sound in the Kremlin and every golden sinew would be
mobilized.  And no one outside Moscow had been watching
the process, no one suspected that Goldfinger—the
jeweller, the metallurgist, the resident of Reculver and
Nassau, the respected member of Blades, of the Royal St
Marks at Sandwich—was one of the greatest conspirators
of all time, that he had financed the murder of hundreds,
perhaps thousands of victims of SMERSH all over the world.
SMERSH, 'Smiert Spionam', Death to Spies—the murder
Apparat of the High Praesidium!  And only M suspected
it, only Bond knew it.  And here was Bond, launched
against this man by a series of flukes, a train of coincidence
that had been started by a plane breaking down on the
other side of the world.  Bond smiled grimly to himself.
How often in his profession had it been the same—the
tiny acorn of coincidence that soared into the mighty oak
whose branches darkened the sky.  And now, once again, he
was setting out to bring the dreadful growth down.  With
what?  A bag of golf clubs?
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
A repainted sky-blue Ford Popular with large yellow
ears was scurrying along the crown of the road ahead.
Mechanically Bond gave the horn ring a couple of short,
polite jabs.  There was no reaction.  The Ford Popular was
doing its forty.  Why should anyone want to go more than
that respectable speed?  The Ford obstinately hunched its
shoulders and kept on its course.  Bond gave it a sharp blast,
expecting it to swerve.  He had to touch his brakes when it
didn't.  Damn the man!  Of course!  The usual tense figure,
hands held too high up on the wheel, and the inevitable
hat, this time a particularly hideous black bowler, square
on a large bullet head.  Oh well, thought Bond, they
weren't <i class="calibre3">his</i> stomach ulcers.  He changed down and
contemptuously slammed the D.B.III past on the inside.
Silly bastard!
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Another five miles and Bond was through the dainty
teleworld of Herne Bay.  The howl of Manston sounded
away on his right.  A flight of three Super Sabres came in
to land.  They skimmed below his right-hand horizon as if
they were diving into the earth.  With half his mind, Bond
heard the roar of their jets catch up with them as they
landed and taxied in to the hangars.  He came up with a
crossroads.  To the left the signpost said RECULVER.
Underneath was the ancient monument sign for Reculver
church.  Bond slowed, but didn't stop.  No hanging about.
He motored slowly on, keeping his eyes open.  The shoreline
was too exposed for a trawler to do anything but beach
or anchor.  Probably Goldfinger had used Ramsgate.
Quiet little port.  Customs and police who were probably
only on the look-out for brandy coming over from France.
There was a thick clump of trees between the road and the
shore, a glimpse of roofs and of a medium-sized factory
chimney with a thin plume of light smoke or steam.  That
would be it.  Soon there was the gate of a long drive.  A
discreetly authoritative sign said THANET ALLOYS, and
underneath: NO ADMITTANCE EXCEPT ON BUSINESS.  All
very respectable.  Bond drove slowly on.  There was
nothing more to be seen.  He took the next right-hand turn
across the Manston plateau to Ramsgate.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
It was twelve o'clock.  Bond inspected his room, a
double with bathroom, on the top floor of the Channel
Packet, unpacked his few belongings and went down to the
snack bar where he had one vodka and tonic and two
rounds of excellent ham sandwiches with plenty of
mustard.  Then he got back into his car and drove slowly
over to the Royal St Marks at Sandwich.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond carried his clubs to the professional's shop and
through to the workroom.  Alfred Blacking was winding a
new grip on to a driver.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Hullo, Alfred.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The professional looked up sharply.  His sunburned,
leathery face broke into a wide smile.  'Why, if it isn't
Mr James!'  They shook hands.  'Must be fifteen, twenty
years.  What brings you down here, sir?  Someone was
telling me only the other day that you're in the diplomatic or
something.  Always abroad.  Well, I never!  Still the same
flat swing, sir?'  Alfred Blacking joined his hands and gave
a low, flat sweep.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Afraid so, Alfred.  Never had time to get myself out of
it.  How's Mrs Blacking and Cecil?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Can't complain, sir.  Cecil was runner-up in the Kent
Championship last year.  Should win it this year if he can
only get out of the shop and on to the course a bit more.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond propped his clubs up against the wall.  It was good
to be back.  Everything was just the same.  There had been
a time in his teens when he had played two rounds a day
every day of the week at St Marks.  Blacking had always
wanted to take him in hand.  'A bit of practice, Mr James,
and you'd be scratch.  No fooling.  You really would.  What
do you want to hang around at six for?  It's all there except
for that flat swing and wanting to hit the ball out of sight
when there's no point in it.  And you've got the
temperament.  A couple of years, perhaps only one, and I'd have
you in the Amateur.'  But something had told Bond that
there wasn't going to be a great deal of golf in his life and
if he liked the game he'd better forget about lessons and
just play as much of it as he could.  Yes, it would be
about twenty years since he had played his last round on
St Marks.  He'd never been back—even when there had
been that bloody affair of the Moonraker at Kingsdown,
ten miles down the coast.  Perhaps it had been
sentimentality.  Since St Marks, Bond had got in a good deal
of weekend golf when he was at headquarters.  But always
on the courses round London—Huntercombe, Swinley,
Sunningdale, the Berkshire.  Bond's handicap had gone
up to nine.  But he was a real nine—had to be with the
games he chose to play, the ten-pound Nassaus with the
tough cheery men who were always so anxious to stand
you a couple of double kümmels after lunch.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Any chance of a game, Alfred?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The professional glanced through his back window at
the parking space round the tall flag-pole.  He shook his
head.  'Doesn't look too good, sir.  Don't get many players
in the middle of the week at this time of year.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'What about you?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Sorry, sir.  I'm booked.  Playing with a member.  It's a
regular thing.  Every day at two o'clock.  And the trouble
is that Cecil's gone over to Princes to get in some practice
for the championship.  What a dashed nuisance!'  (Alfred
never used a stronger oath.)  'It <i class="calibre3">would</i> happen like that.
How long are you staying, sir?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Not long.  Never mind.  I'll knock a ball round with a
caddie.  Who's this chap you're playing with?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'A Mr Goldfinger, sir.'  Alfred looked discouraging.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Oh, Goldfinger.  I know the chap.  Met him the other
day in America.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'You did, sir?'  Alfred obviously found it difficult to
believe that anyone knew Mr Goldfinger.  He watched
Bond's face carefully for any further reaction.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Any good?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'So-so, sir.  Pretty useful off nine.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Must take his game damned seriously if he plays with
you every day.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Well, yes, sir.'  The professional's face had the
expression Bond remembered so well.  It meant that Blacking
had an unfavourable view of a particular member but
that he was too good a servant of the club to pass it on.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond smiled.  He said, 'You haven't changed, Alfred.
What you mean is that no one else will play with him.
Remember Farquharson?  Slowest player in England.  I
remember you going round and round with him twenty
years ago.  Come on.  What's the matter with Goldfinger?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The professional laughed.  He said, 'It's you that hasn't
changed, Mr James.  You always were dashed inquisitive.'  He
came a step closer and lowered his voice.  'The truth is,
sir, some members think Mr Goldfinger is just a little bit
hot.  You know, sir.  Improves his lie and so forth.'  The
professional took the driver he was holding, took up a
stance, gazed towards an imaginary hole and banged the
head of the club up and down on the floor as if addressing
an imaginary ball.  'Let me see now, is this a brassie lie?
What d'you think, caddie?'  Alfred Blacking chuckled.
'Well, of course, by the time he's finished hammering the
ground behind the ball, the ball's been raised an inch and
it <i class="calibre3">is</i> a brassie lie.'  Alfred Blacking's face closed up again.
He said non-committally, 'But that's only gossip, sir.  I've
never seen anything.  Quiet-spoken gentleman.  He's got a
place at Reculver.  Used to come here a lot.  But for the
last few years he's only been coming to England for a
few weeks at a time.  Rings up and asks if anyone's wanting
a game and when there isn't anyone he books Cecil or me.
Rang up this morning and asked if there was anyone about.
There's sometimes a stranger drops in.'  Alfred Blacking
looked quizzically at Bond.  'I suppose you wouldn't care
to take him on this afternoon?  It'll look odd you being
here and short of a game.  And you knowing him and all.
He might think I'd been trying to keep him to myself or
something.  That wouldn't do.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Nonsense, Alfred.  And you've got your living to make.
Why don't we play a three-ball?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'He won't play them, sir.  Says they're too slow.  And I
agree with him.  And don't you worry about my fee.
There's a lot of work to do in the shop and I'll be glad of
an afternoon to get down to it.'  Alfred Blacking glanced at
his watch.  'He'll be along any minute now.  I've got a
caddie for you.  Remember Hawker?'  Alfred Blacking
laughed indulgently.  'Still the same old Hawker.  He'll be
another that'll be glad to see you down here again.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond said, 'Well thanks, Alfred.  I'd be interested to see
how this chap plays.  But why not leave it like this?  Say I've
dropped in to get a club made up.  Old member.  Used to
play here before the war.  And I need a new number four
wood anyway.  Your old one has started to give at the
seams a bit.  Just be casual.  Don't say you've told me he's
about.  I'll stay in the shop so it'll give him a chance to
take his choice without offending me.  Perhaps he won't
like my face or something.  Right?'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
'Very good, Mr James.  Leave it to me.  That's his car
coming now, sir.'  Blacking pointed through the window.
Half a mile away, a bright yellow car was turning off the
road and coming up the private drive.  'Funny looking
contraption.  Sort of motor car we used to see here when
I was a boy.'
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Bond watched the old Silver Ghost sweep majestically
up the drive towards the club.  She was a beauty!  The sun
glittered off the silver radiator and off the engine-turned
aluminium shield below the high perpendicular glass cliff
of the windscreen.  The luggage rail on the roof of the
heavy coach-built limousine body—so ugly twenty years
ago, so strangely beautiful today—was polished brass, as
were the two Lucas 'King of the Road' headlamps that
stared so haughtily down the road ahead, and the wide
mouth of the old boa-constrictor bulb horn.  The whole
car, except for a black roof and black carrosserie lines and
curved panels below the windows, was primrose yellow.
It crossed Bond's mind that the South American president
might have had it copied from the famous yellow fleet in
which Lord Lonsdale had driven to the Derby and Ascot.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
And now?  In the driver's seat sat a figure in a café-au-lait
dust coat and cap, his big round face obscured by
black-rimmed driving goggles.  Beside him was a squat
figure in black with a bowler hat placed firmly on the
middle of his head.  The two figures stared straight in front
of them with a curious immobility.  It was almost as if they
were driving a hearse.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
The car was coming closer.  The six pairs of eyes—the
eyes of the two men and the great twin orbs of the
car—seemed to be looking straight through the little window
and into Bond's eyes.
</p>

<p class="calibre4">
Instinctively, Bond took a few paces back into the dark
recesses of the workroom.  He noticed the movement and
smiled to himself.  He picked up somebody's putter and
bent down and thoughtfully addressed a knot in the
wooden floor.
