<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">P</span><span class="sc">unctually at</span> six o’clock the sun set with a last yellow
flash behind the Blue Mountains, a wave of violet shadow
poured down Richmond Road, and the crickets and tree frogs
in the fine gardens began to zing and tinkle.</p>

<p class="pindent">Apart from the background noise of the insects, the wide
empty street was quiet. The wealthy owners of the big, withdrawn
houses—the bank managers, company directors and
top civil servants—had been home since five o’clock and they
would be discussing the day with their wives or taking a
shower and changing their clothes. In half an hour the street
would come to life again with the cocktail traffic, but now this
very superior half mile of ‘Rich Road’, as it was known to the
tradesmen of Kingston, held nothing but the suspense of an
empty stage and the heavy perfume of night-scented jasmine.</p>

<p class="pindent">Richmond Road is the ‘best’ road in all Jamaica. It is
Jamaica’s Park Avenue, its Kensington Palace Gardens, its
Avenue D’Iéna. The ‘best’ people live in its big old-fashioned
houses, each in an acre or two of beautiful lawn set, too trimly,
with the finest trees and flowers from the Botanical Gardens
at Hope. The long, straight road is cool and quiet and withdrawn
from the hot, vulgar sprawl of Kingston where its residents
earn their money, and, on the other side of the T-intersection
at its top, lie the grounds of King’s House, where the
Governor and Commander-in-Chief of Jamaica lives with his
family. In Jamaica, no road could have a finer ending.</p>

<p class="pindent">On the eastern corner of the top intersection stands No. 1
Richmond Road, a substantial two-storey house with broad
white-painted verandas running round both floors. From the
road a gravel path leads up to the pillared entrance through
wide lawns marked out with tennis courts on which this evening,
as on all evenings, the sprinklers are at work. This mansion
is the social Mecca of Kingston. It is Queen’s Club, which, for
fifty years, has boasted the power and frequency of its black-balls.</p>

<p class="pindent">Such stubborn retreats will not long survive in modern
Jamaica. One day Queen’s Club will have its windows smashed
and perhaps be burned to the ground, but for the time being it
is a useful place to find in a sub-tropical island—well run, well
staffed and with the finest cuisine and cellar in the Caribbean.</p>

<p class="pindent">At that time of day, on most evenings of the year, you would
find the same four motor cars standing in the road outside the
club. They were the cars belonging to the high bridge game
that assembled punctually at five and played until around midnight.
You could almost set your watch by these cars. They
belonged, reading from the order in which they now stood
against the kerb, to the Brigadier in command of the Caribbean
Defence Force, to Kingston’s leading criminal lawyer, and to
the Mathematics Professor from Kingston University. At the
tail of the line stood the black Sunbeam Alpine of Commander
John Strangways, RN (Ret.), Regional Control Officer for the
Caribbean—or, less discreetly, the local representative of the
British Secret Service.</p>

<p class="noindent"> </p>

<p class="pindent">Just before six-fifteen, the silence of Richmond Road was
softly broken. Three blind beggars came round the corner of
the intersection and moved slowly down the pavement towards
the four cars. They were Chigroes—Chinese Negroes—bulky
men, but bowed as they shuffled along, tapping at the kerb
with their white sticks. They walked in file. The first man,
who wore blue glasses and could presumably see better than
the others, walked in front holding a tin cup against the crook
of the stick in his left hand. The right hand of the second
man rested on his shoulder and the right hand of the third on
the shoulder of the second. The eyes of the second and third
men were shut. The three men were dressed in rags and wore
dirty jippa-jappa baseball caps with long peaks. They said
nothing and no noise came from them except the soft tapping
of their sticks as they came slowly down the shadowed pavement
towards the group of cars.</p>

<p class="pindent">The three blind men would not have been incongruous in
Kingston, where there are many diseased people on the streets,
but, in this quiet rich empty street, they made an unpleasant
impression. And it was odd that they should all be Chinese
Negroes. This is not a common mixture of bloods.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the cardroom, the sunburned hand reached out into the
green pool of the centre table and gathered up the four cards.
There was a quiet snap as the trick went to join the rest.
“Hundred honours,” said Strangways, “and ninety below!”
He looked at his watch and stood up. “Back in twenty minutes.
Your deal, Bill. Order some drinks. Usual for me. Don’t bother
to cook a hand for me while I’m gone. I always spot them.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bill Templar, the Brigadier, laughed shortly. He pinged the
bell by his side and raked the cards in towards him. He said,
“Hurry up, blast you. You always let the cards go cold just
as your partner’s in the money.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Strangways was already out of the door. The three men sat
back resignedly in their chairs. The coloured steward came in
and they ordered drinks for themselves and a whisky and water
for Strangways.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was this maddening interruption every evening at six-fifteen,
about halfway through their second rubber. At this
time precisely, even if they were in the middle of a hand,
Strangways had to go to his ‘office’ and ‘make a call’. It was
a damned nuisance. But Strangways was a vital part of their
four and they put up with it. It was never explained what ‘the
call’ was, and no one asked. Strangways’s job was ‘hush’ and
that was that. He was rarely away for more than twenty
minutes and it was understood that he paid for his absence
with a round of drinks.</p>

<p class="pindent">The drinks came and the three men began to talk racing.</p>

<p class="noindent"> </p>

<p class="pindent">In fact, this was the most important moment in Strangways’s
day—the time of his duty radio contact with the powerful
transmitter on the roof of the building in Regent’s Park that
is the headquarters of the Secret Service. Every day, at
eighteen-thirty local time, unless he gave warning the day
before that he would not be on the air—when he had business
on one of the other islands in his territory, for instance, or was
seriously ill—he would transmit his daily report and receive
his orders. If he failed to come on the air precisely at six-thirty,
there would be a second call, the ‘Blue’ call, at seven,
and, finally, the ‘Red’ call at seven-thirty. After this, if his
transmitter remained silent, it was ‘Emergency’, and Section
III, his controlling authority in London, would urgently get
on the job of finding out what had happened to him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Even a ‘Blue’ call means a bad mark for an agent unless
his ‘Reasons in Writing’ are unanswerable. London’s radio
schedules round the world are desperately tight and their
minute disruption by even one extra call is a dangerous
nuisance. Strangways had never suffered the ignominy of a
‘Blue’ call, let alone a ‘Red’, and was as certain as could be that
he never would do so. Every evening, at precisely six-fifteen,
he left Queen’s Club, got into his car and drove for ten minutes
up into the foothills of the Blue Mountains to his neat bungalow
with the fabulous view over Kingston harbour. At six
twenty-five he walked through the hall to the office at the back.
He unlocked the door and locked it again behind him. Miss
Trueblood, who passed as his secretary, but was in fact his
No 2 and a former Chief Officer WRNS, would already be
sitting in front of the dials inside the dummy filing cabinet.
She would have the earphones on and would be making first
contact, tapping out his call-sign, WXN, on 14 megacycles.
There would be a shorthand pad on her elegant knees. Strangways
would drop into the chair beside her and pick up the
other pair of headphones and, at exactly six twenty-eight, he
would take over from her and wait for the sudden hollowness
in the ether that meant that WWW in London was coming
in to acknowledge.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was an iron routine. Strangways was a man of iron
routine. Unfortunately, strict patterns of behaviour can be
deadly if they are read by an enemy.</p>

<p class="pindent">Strangways, a tall lean man with a black patch over the
right eye and the sort of aquiline good looks you associate
with the bridge of a destroyer, walked quickly across the
mahogany panelled hallway of Queen’s Club and pushed
through the light mosquito-wired doors and ran down the
three steps to the path.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was nothing very much on his mind except the
sensual pleasure of the clean fresh evening air and the memory
of the finesse that had given him his three spades. There was
this case, of course, the case he was working on, a curious and
complicated affair that M had rather nonchalantly tossed over
the air at him two weeks earlier. But it was going well. A
chance lead into the Chinese community had paid off. Some
odd angles had come to light—for the present the merest
shadows of angles—but if they jelled, thought Strangways as
he strode down the gravel path and into Richmond Road, he
might find himself involved in something very odd indeed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Strangways shrugged his shoulders. Of course it wouldn’t
turn out like that. The fantastic never materialized in his line
of business. There would be some drab solution that had been
embroidered by overheated imaginations and the usual hysteria
of the Chinese.</p>

<p class="pindent">Automatically, another part of Strangways’s mind took in
the three blind men. They were tapping slowly towards him
down the sidewalk. They were about twenty yards away. He
calculated that they would pass him a second or two before
he reached his car. Out of shame for his own health and
gratitude for it, Strangways felt for a coin. He ran his thumbnail
down its edge to make sure it was a florin and not a penny.
He took it out. He was parallel with the beggars. How odd,
they were all Chigroes! How very odd! Strangways’s hand
went out. The coin clanged in the tin cup.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Bless you, Master,” said the leading man. “Bless you,”
echoed the other two.</p>

<p class="pindent">The car key was in Strangways’s hand. Vaguely he registered
the moment of silence as the tapping of the white sticks ceased.
It was too late.</p>

<p class="pindent">As Strangways had passed the last man, all three had
swivelled. The back two had fanned out a step to have a clear
field of fire. Three revolvers, ungainly with their sausage-shaped
silencers, whipped out of holsters concealed among
the rags. With disciplined precision the three men aimed at
different points down Strangways’s spine—one between the
shoulders, one in the small of the back, one at the pelvis.</p>

<p class="pindent">The three heavy coughs were almost one. Strangways’s body
was hurled forward as if it had been kicked. It lay absolutely
still in the small puff of dust from the sidewalk.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was six-seventeen. With a squeal of tyres, a dingy motor
hearse with black plumes flying from the four corners of its
roof took the T-intersection into Richmond Road and shot
down towards the group on the pavement. The three men had
just had time to pick up Strangways’s body when the hearse slid
to a stop abreast of them. The double doors at the back were
open. So was the plain deal coffin inside. The three men manhandled
the body through the doors and into the coffin. They
climbed in. The lid was put on and the doors pulled shut. The
three Negroes sat down on three of the four little seats at the
corners of the coffin and unhurriedly laid their white sticks
beside them. Roomy black alpaca coats hung over the backs
of the seats. They put the coats on over their rags. Then they
took off their baseball caps and reached down to the floor and
picked up black top hats and put them on their heads.</p>

<p class="pindent">The driver, who also was a Chinese Negro, looked nervously
over his shoulder.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Go, man. Go!” said the biggest of the killers. He glanced
down at the luminous dial of his wrist watch. It said six-twenty.
Just three minutes for the job. Dead on time.</p>

<p class="pindent">The hearse made a decorous U-turn and moved at a sedate
speed up to the intersection. There it turned right and at thirty
miles an hour it cruised genteelly up the tarmac highway towards
the hills, its black plumes streaming the doleful signal of
its burden and the three mourners sitting bolt upright with
their arms crossed respectfully over their hearts.</p>

<p class="noindent"> </p>

<p class="pindent">‘WXN calling WWW . . . . WXN calling WWW . . . .
WXN . . . WXN . . . WXN . . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">The centre finger of Mary Trueblood’s right hand stabbed
softly, elegantly, at the key. She lifted her left wrist. Six twenty-eight.
He was a minute late. Mary Trueblood smiled at the
thought of the little open Sunbeam tearing up the road towards
her. Now, in a second, she would hear the quick step, then the
key in the lock and he would be sitting beside her. There would
be the apologetic smile as he reached for the earphones.
“Sorry, Mary. Damned car wouldn’t start.” Or, “You’d think
the blasted police knew my number by now. Stopped me at
Halfway Tree.” Mary Trueblood took the second pair of earphones
off their hook and put them on his chair to save him half
a second.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘. . . WXN calling WWW. . . . WXN calling WWW . . . .’
She tuned the dial a hair’s breadth and tried again. Her watch
said six-twenty-nine. She began to worry. In a matter of
seconds, London would be coming in. Suddenly she thought,
God, what could she do if Strangways wasn’t on time! It was
useless for her to acknowledge London and pretend she was him—useless
and dangerous. Radio Security would be monitoring
the call, as they monitored every call from an agent. Those
instruments which measured the minute peculiarities in an
operator’s ‘fist’ would at once detect it wasn’t Strangways at
the key. Mary Trueblood had been shown the forest of dials in
the quiet room on the top floor at headquarters, had watched
as the dancing hands registered the weight of each pulse, the
speed of each cipher group, the stumble over a particular letter.
The Controller had explained it all to her when she had joined
the Caribbean station five years before—how a buzzer would
sound and the contact be automatically broken if the wrong
operator had come on the air. It was the basic protection against
a Secret Service transmitter falling into enemy hands. And, if
an agent had been captured and was being forced to contact
London under torture, he had only to add a few hairbreadth
peculiarities to his usual ‘fist’ and they would tell the story of
his capture as clearly as if he had announced it <span class="it">en clair</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now it had come! Now she was hearing the hollowness in
the ether that meant London was coming in. Mary Trueblood
glanced at her watch. Six-thirty. Panic! But now, at last, there
were the footsteps in the hall. Thank God! In a second he
would come in. She <span class="it">must</span> protect him! Desperately she decided
to take a chance and keep the circuit open.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘WWW calling WXN . . . . WWW calling WXN . . . . Can
you hear me? . . . can you hear me?’ London was coming over
strong, searching for the Jamaica station.</p>

<p class="pindent">The footsteps were at the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">Coolly, confidently, she tapped back: ‘Hear you loud and
clear. . . . Hear you loud and clear. . . . Hear you . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">Behind her there was an explosion. Something hit her on
the ankle. She looked down. It was the lock of the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mary Trueblood swivelled sharply on her chair. A man
stood in the doorway. It wasn’t Strangways. It was a big Negro
with yellowish skin and slanting eyes. There was a gun in his
hand. It ended in a thick black cylinder.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mary Trueblood opened her mouth to scream.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man smiled broadly. Slowly, lovingly, he lifted the gun
and shot her three times in and around the left breast.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl slumped sideways off her chair. The earphones
slipped off her golden hair on to the floor. For perhaps a
second the tiny chirrup of London sounded out into the room.
Then it stopped. The buzzer at the Controller’s desk in Radio
Security had signalled that something was wrong on WXN.</p>

<p class="pindent">The killer walked out of the door. He came back carrying
a box with a coloured label on it that said PRESTO FIRE,
and a big sugar sack marked TATE &amp; LYLE. He put the
box down on the floor and went to the body and roughly forced
the sack over the head and down to the ankles. The feet stuck
out. He bent them and crammed them in. He dragged the
bulky sack out into the hall and came back. In the corner of
the room the safe stood open, as he had been told it would,
and the cipher books had been taken out and laid on the desk
ready for work on the London signals. The man threw these
and all the papers in the safe into the centre of the room. He
tore down the curtains and added them to the pile. He topped
it up with a couple of chairs. He opened the box of Presto firelighters
and took out a handful and tucked them into the pile
and lit them. Then he went out into the hall and lit similar
bonfires in appropriate places. The tinder-dry furniture caught
quickly and the flames began to lick up the panelling. The
man went to the front door and opened it. Through the
hibiscus hedge he could see the glint of the hearse. There was
no noise except the zing of crickets and the soft tick-over of
the car’s engine. Up and down the road there was no other
sign of life. The man went back into the smoke-filled hall and
easily shouldered the sack and came out again, leaving the
door open to make a draught. He walked swiftly down the
path to the road. The back doors of the hearse were open. He
handed in the sack and watched the two men force it into the
coffin on top of Strangways’s body. Then he climbed in and
shut the doors and sat down and put on his top hat.</p>

<p class="pindent">As the first flames showed in the upper windows of the
bungalow, the hearse moved quietly from the sidewalk and
went on its way up towards the Mona Reservoir. There the
weighted coffin would slip down into its fifty-fathom grave and,
in just forty-five minutes, the personnel and records of the
Caribbean station of the Secret Service would have been
utterly destroyed.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_2">II<br class="lgl"/> CHOICE OF WEAPONS</h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="sc">hree weeks</span> later, in London, March came in like a
rattlesnake.</p>

<p class="pindent">From first light on March 1st, hail and icy sleet, with a
Force 8 gale behind them, lashed at the city and went on
lashing as the people streamed miserably to work, their legs
whipped by the wet hems of their macintoshes and their faces
blotching with the cold.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a filthy day and everybody said so—even M, who
rarely admitted the existence of weather even in its extreme
forms. When the old black Silver Wraith Rolls with the
nondescript number-plate stopped outside the tall building
in Regent’s Park and he climbed stiffly out on to the pavement,
hail hit him in the face like a whiff of small-shot. Instead of
hurrying inside the building, he walked deliberately round the
car to the window beside the chauffeur.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Won’t be needing the car again today, Smith. Take it away
and go home. I’ll use the tube this evening. No weather for
driving a car. Worse than one of those PQ convoys.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Ex-Leading Stoker Smith grinned gratefully. “Aye-aye, sir.
And thanks.” He watched the elderly erect figure walk round
the bonnet of the Rolls and across the pavement and into the
building. Just like the old boy. He’d always see the men right
first. Smith clicked the gear lever into first and moved off,
peering forward through the streaming windscreen. They
didn’t come like that any more.</p>

<p class="pindent">M went up in the lift to the eighth floor and along the thick-carpeted
corridor to his office. He shut the door behind him,
took off his overcoat and scarf and hung them behind the door.
He took out a large blue silk bandanna handkerchief and
brusquely wiped it over his face. It was odd, but he wouldn’t
have done this in front of the porters or the liftman. He went
over to his desk and sat down and bent towards the intercom.
He pressed a switch. “I’m in, Miss Moneypenny. The signals,
please, and anything else you’ve got. Then get me Sir James
Molony. He’ll be doing his rounds at St Mary’s about now.
Tell the Chief of Staff I’ll see 007 in half an hour. And let me
have the Strangways file.” M waited for the metallic “Yes, sir”
and released the switch.</p>

<p class="pindent">He sat back and reached for his pipe and began filling it
thoughtfully. He didn’t look up when his secretary came in
with the stack of papers and he even ignored the half dozen
pink Most Immediates on top of the signal file. If they had
been vital he would have been called during the night.</p>

<p class="pindent">A yellow light winked on the intercom. M picked up the
black telephone from the row of four. “That you, Sir James?
Have you got five minutes?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Six, for you.” At the other end of the line the famous
neurologist chuckled. “Want me to certify one of Her Majesty’s
Ministers?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Not today.” M frowned irritably. The old Navy had respected
governments. “It’s about that man of mine you’ve
been handling. We won’t bother about the name. This is an
open line. I gather you let him out yesterday. Is he fit for
duty?”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a pause on the other end. Now the voice was
professional, judicious. “Physically he’s as fit as a fiddle. Leg’s
healed up. Shouldn’t be any after-effects. Yes, he’s all right.”
There was another pause. “Just one thing, M. There’s a lot
of tension there, you know. You work these men of yours
pretty hard. Can you give him something easy to start with?
From what you’ve told me he’s been having a tough time for
some years now.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M said gruffly, “That’s what he’s paid for. It’ll soon show
if he’s not up to the work. Won’t be the first one that’s cracked.
From what you say, he sounds in perfectly good shape. It
isn’t as if he’d really been damaged like some of the patients
I’ve sent you—men who’ve been properly put through the
mangle.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course, if you put it like that. But pain’s an odd thing.
We know very little about it. You can’t measure it—the
difference in suffering between a woman having a baby and
a man having a renal colic. And, thank God, the body seems
to forget fairly quickly. But this man of yours has been in
<span class="it">real</span> pain, M. Don’t think that just because nothing’s been
broken . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Quite, quite.” Bond had made a mistake and he had
suffered for it. In any case M didn’t like being lectured, even
by one of the most famous doctors in the world, on how he
should handle his agents. There had been a note of criticism
in Sir James Molony’s voice. M said abruptly, “Ever hear of
a man called Steincrohn—Dr Peter Steincrohn?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No, who’s he?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“American doctor. Written a book my Washington people
sent over for our library. This man talks about how much
punishment the human body can put up with. Gives a list of
the bits of the body an average man can do without. Matter
of fact, I copied it out for future reference. Care to hear the
list?” M dug into his coat pocket and put some letters and
scraps of paper on the desk in front of him. With his left hand
he selected a piece of paper and unfolded it. He wasn’t put
out by the silence on the other end of the line, “Hullo, Sir
James! Well, here they are: ‘Gall bladder, spleen, tonsils,
appendix, one of his two kidneys, one of his two lungs, two of
his four or five quarts of blood, two-fifths of his liver, most of
his stomach, four of his twenty-three feet of intestines and
half of his brain.’ ” M paused. When the silence continued at
the other end, he said, “Any comments, Sir James?”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a reluctant grunt at the other end of the telephone.
“I wonder he didn’t add an arm and a leg, or all of
them. I don’t see quite what you’re trying to prove.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M gave a curt laugh. “I’m not trying to prove anything, Sir
James. It just struck me as an interesting list. All I’m trying
to say is that my man seems to have got off pretty lightly
compared with that sort of punishment. But,” M relented,
“don’t let’s argue about it.” He said in a milder voice, “As a
matter of fact I did have it in mind to let him have a bit of a
breather. Something’s come up in Jamaica.” M glanced at the
streaming windows. “It’ll be more of a rest cure than anything.
Two of my people, a man and a girl, have gone off together. Or
that’s what it looks like. Our friend can have a spell at being an
inquiry agent—in the sunshine too. How’s that?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Just the ticket. I wouldn’t mind the job myself on a day
like this.” But Sir James Molony was determined to get his
message through. He persisted mildly. “Don’t think I wanted
to interfere, M, but there are limits to a man’s courage. I know
you have to treat these men as if they were expendable, but
presumably you don’t want them to crack at the wrong moment.
This one I’ve had here is tough. I’d say you’ll get plenty more
work out of him. But you know what Moran has to say about
courage in that book of his.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’t recall.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“He says that courage is a capital sum reduced by expenditure.
I agree with him. All I’m trying to say is that this
particular man seems to have been spending pretty hard since
before the war. I wouldn’t say he’s overdrawn—not yet, but
there are limits.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Just so.” M decided that was quite enough of that. Nowadays,
softness was everywhere. “That’s why I’m sending him
abroad. Holiday in Jamaica. Don’t worry, Sir James. I’ll take
care of him. By the way, did you ever discover what the stuff
was that Russian woman put into him?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Got the answer yesterday.” Sir James Molony also was
glad the subject had been changed. The old man was as raw
as the weather. Was there any chance that he had got his
message across into what he described to himself as M’s thick
skull? “Taken us three months. It was a bright chap at the
School of Tropical Medicine who came up with it. The drug
was <span class="it">fugu</span> poison. The Japanese use it for committing suicide.
It comes from the sex organs of the Japanese globe-fish. Trust
the Russians to use something no one’s ever heard of. They
might just as well have used curare. It has much the same
effect—paralysis of the central nervous system. <span class="it">Fugu’s</span> scientific
name is Tetrodotoxin. It’s terrible stuff and very quick. One
shot of it like your man got and in a matter of seconds the
motor and respiratory muscles are paralysed. At first the chap
sees double and then he can’t keep his eyes open. Next he can’t
swallow. His head falls and he can’t raise it. Dies of respiratory
paralysis.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Lucky he got away with it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Miracle. Thanks entirely to that Frenchman who was with
him. Got your man on the floor and gave him artificial respiration
as if he was drowning. Somehow kept his lungs going
until the doctor came. Luckily the doctor had worked in South
America. Diagnosed curare and treated him accordingly. But
it was a chance in a million. By the same token, what happened
to the Russian woman?”</p>

<p class="pindent">M said shortly, “Oh, she died. Well, many thanks, Sir
James. And don’t worry about your patient. I’ll see he has
an easy time of it. Goodbye.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M hung up. His face was cold and blank. He pulled over the
signal file and went quickly through it. On some of the signals
he scribbled a comment. Occasionally he made a brief telephone
call to one of the Sections. When he had finished he
tossed the pile into his <span class="it">Out</span> basket and reached for his pipe
and the tobacco jar made out of the base of a fourteen-pounder
shell. Nothing remained in front of him except a buff folder
marked with the Top Secret red star. Across the centre of the
folder was written in block capitals: CARIBBEAN STATION,
and underneath, in italics, <span class="it">Strangways and Trueblood</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">A light winked on the intercom. M pressed down the
switch. “Yes?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“007’s here, sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Send him in. And tell the Armourer to come up in five
minutes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M sat back. He put his pipe in his mouth and set a match to
it. Through the smoke he watched the door to his secretary’s
office. His eyes were very bright and watchful.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond came through the door and shut it behind him.
He walked over to the chair across the desk from M and sat
down.</p>

<p class="pindent">“ ’Morning, 007.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Good morning, sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">There was silence in the room except for the rasping of M’s
pipe. It seemed to be taking a lot of matches to get it going. In
the background the fingernails of the sleet slashed against the
two broad windows.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was all just as Bond had remembered it through the
months of being shunted from hospital to hospital, the weeks
of dreary convalescence, the hard work of getting his body
back into shape. To him this represented stepping back into
life. Sitting here in this room opposite M was the symbol of
normality he had longed for. He looked across through the
smoke clouds into the shrewd grey eyes. They were watching
him. What was coming? A post-mortem on the shambles
which had been his last case? A curt relegation to one of the
home sections for a spell of desk work? Or some splendid new
assignment M had been keeping on ice while waiting for Bond
to get back to duty?</p>

<p class="pindent">M threw the box of matches down on the red leather desk.
He leant back and clasped his hands behind his head.</p>

<p class="pindent">“How do you feel? Glad to be back?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Very glad, sir. And I feel fine.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Any final thoughts about your last case? Haven’t bothered
you with it till you got well. You heard I ordered an inquiry. I
believe the Chief of Staff took some evidence from you. Anything
to add?”</p>

<p class="pindent">M’s voice was businesslike, cold. Bond didn’t like it. Something
unpleasant was coming. He said, “No, sir. It was a mess.
I blame myself for letting that woman get me. Shouldn’t have
happened.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M took his hands from behind his neck and slowly leant
forward and placed them flat on the desk in front of him. His
eyes were hard. “Just so.” The voice was velvet, dangerous.
“Your gun got stuck, if I recall. This Beretta of yours with the
silencer. Something wrong there, 007. Can’t afford that sort of
mistake if you’re to carry an 00 number. Would you prefer to
drop it and go back to normal duties?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stiffened. His eyes looked resentfully into M’s. The
licence to kill for the Secret Service, the double-0 prefix, was
a great honour. It had been earned hardly. It brought Bond
the only assignments he enjoyed, the dangerous ones. “No, I
wouldn’t, sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Then we’ll have to change your equipment. That was one
of the findings of the Court of Inquiry. I agree with it. D’you
understand?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said obstinately, “I’m used to that gun, sir. I like working
with it. What happened could have happened to anyone.
With any kind of gun.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I don’t agree. Nor did the Court of Inquiry. So that’s final.
The only question is what you’re to use instead.” M bent
forward to the intercom. “Is the Armourer there? Send him
in.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M sat back. “You may not know it, 007, but Major Boothroyd’s
the greatest small-arms expert in the world. He wouldn’t
be here if he wasn’t. We’ll hear what he has to say.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The door opened. A short slim man with sandy hair came in
and walked over to the desk and stood beside Bond’s chair.
Bond looked up into his face. He hadn’t often seen the man
before, but he remembered the very wide apart clear grey eyes
that never seemed to flicker. With a non-committal glance
down at Bond, the man stood relaxed, looking across at M.
He said “Good morning, sir,” in a flat, unemotional voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">“ ’Morning, Armourer. Now I want to ask you some questions.”
M’s voice was casual. “First of all, what do you think
of the Beretta, the .25?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Ladies’ gun, sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M raised ironic eyebrows at Bond. Bond smiled thinly.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Really! And why do you say that?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No stopping power, sir. But it’s easy to operate. A bit
fancy looking too, if you know what I mean, sir. Appeals to
the ladies.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“How would it be with a silencer?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Still less stopping power, sir. And I don’t like silencers.
They’re heavy and get stuck in your clothing when you’re in
a hurry. I wouldn’t recommend anyone to try a combination
like that, sir. Not if they were meaning business.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M said pleasantly to Bond, “Any comment, 007?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shrugged his shoulders. “I don’t agree. I’ve used the
.25 Beretta for fifteen years. Never had a stoppage and I
haven’t missed with it yet. Not a bad record for a gun. It just
happens that I’m used to it and I can point it straight. I’ve
used bigger guns when I’ve had to—the .45 Colt with the long
barrel, for instance. But for close-up work and concealment I
like the Beretta.” Bond paused. He felt he should give way
somewhere. “I’d agree about the silencer, sir. They’re a
nuisance. But sometimes you have to use them.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“We’ve seen what happens when you do,” said M drily.
“And as for changing your gun, it’s only a question of practice.
You’ll soon get the feel of a new one.” M allowed a trace of
sympathy to enter his voice. “Sorry, 007. But I’ve decided.
Just stand up a moment. I want the Armourer to get a look
at your build.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stood up and faced the other man. There was no
warmth in the two pairs of eyes. Bond’s showed irritation.
Major Boothroyd’s were indifferent, clinical. He walked round
Bond. He said “Excuse me” and felt Bond’s biceps and forearms.
He came back in front of him and said, “Might I see
your gun?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s hand went slowly into his coat. He handed over the
taped Beretta with the sawn barrel. Boothroyd examined the
gun and weighed it in his hand. He put it down on the desk.
“And your holster?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took off his coat and slipped off the chamois leather
holster and harness. He put his coat on again.</p>

<p class="pindent">With a glance at the lips of the holster, perhaps to see if they
showed traces of snagging. Boothroyd tossed the holster down
beside the gun with a motion that sneered. He looked across
at M. “I think we can do better than this, sir.” It was the sort
of voice Bond’s first expensive tailor had used.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat down. He just stopped himself gazing rudely at the
ceiling. Instead he looked impassively across at M.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, Armourer, what do you recommend?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Major Boothroyd put on the expert’s voice. “As a matter of
fact, sir,” he said modestly, “I’ve just been testing most of the
small automatics. Five thousand rounds each at twenty-five
yards. Of all of them, I’d choose the Walther PPK 7.65 mm.
It only came fourth after the Japanese M-14, the Russian
Tokarev and the Sauer M-38. But I like its light trigger pull and
the extension spur of the magazine gives a grip that should suit
007. It’s a real stopping gun. Of course it’s about a .32 calibre
as compared with the Beretta’s .25, but I wouldn’t recommend
anything lighter. And you can get ammunition for the Walther
anywhere in the world. That gives it an edge on the Japanese
and the Russian guns.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M turned to Bond. “Any comments?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It’s a good gun, sir,” Bond admitted. “Bit more bulky than
the Beretta. How does the Armourer suggest I carry it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Berns Martin Triple-draw holster,” said Major Boothroyd
succinctly. “Best worn inside the trouser band to the left. But
it’s all right below the shoulder. Stiff saddle leather. Holds the
gun in with a spring. Should make for a quicker draw than
that,” he gestured towards the desk. “Three-fifths of a second
to hit a man at twenty feet would be about right.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s settled then.” M’s voice was final. “And what about
something bigger?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“There’s only one gun for that, sir,” said Major Boothroyd
stolidly. “Smith &amp; Wesson Centennial Airweight. Revolver.
.38 calibre. Hammerless, so it won’t catch in clothing. Overall
length of six and a half inches and it only weighs thirteen
ounces. To keep down the weight, the cylinder holds only five
cartridges. But by the time they’re gone,” Major Boothroyd
allowed himself a wintry smile, “somebody’s been killed. Fires
the .38 S &amp; W Special. Very accurate cartridge indeed. With
standard loading it has a muzzle velocity of eight hundred
and sixty feet per second and muzzle energy of two hundred
and sixty foot-pounds. There are various barrel lengths,
three and a half inch, five inch . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">“All right, all right.” M’s voice was testy. “Take it as read.
If you say it’s the best I’ll believe you. So it’s the Walther and
the Smith &amp; Wesson. Send up one of each to 007. With the
harness. And arrange for him to fire them in. Starting today.
He’s got to be expert in a week. All right? Then thank you
very much, Armourer. I won’t detain you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thank you, sir,” said Major Boothroyd. He turned and
marched stiffly out of the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a moment’s silence. The sleet tore at the windows.
M swivelled his chair and watched the streaming panes. Bond
took the opportunity to glance at his watch. Ten o’clock. His
eyes slid to the gun and holster on the desk. He thought of his
fifteen years’ marriage to the ugly bit of metal. He remembered
the times its single word had saved his life—and the times
when its threat alone had been enough. He thought of the days
when he had literally dressed to kill—when he had dismantled
the gun and oiled it and packed the bullets carefully into the
springloaded magazine and tried the action once or twice,
pumping the cartridges out on to the bedspread in some hotel
bedroom somewhere round the world. Then the last wipe of a
dry rag and the gun into the little holster and a pause in front
of the mirror to see that nothing showed. And then out of the
door and on his way to the rendezvous that was to end with
either darkness or light. How many times had it saved his life?
How many death sentences had it signed? Bond felt unreasonably
sad. How could one have such ties with an inanimate
object, an ugly one at that, and, he had to admit it, with a
weapon that was not in the same class as the ones chosen by the
Armourer? But he had the ties and M was going to cut them.</p>

<p class="pindent">M swivelled back to face him. “Sorry, James,” he said, and
there was no sympathy in his voice. “I know how you like that
bit of iron. But I’m afraid it’s got to go. Never give a weapon
a second chance—any more than a man. I can’t afford to
gamble with the double-0 section. They’ve got to be properly
equipped. You understand that? A gun’s more important than
a hand or a foot in your job.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled thinly. “I know, sir. I shan’t argue. I’m just
sorry to see it go.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“All right then. We’ll say no more about it. Now I’ve got
some more news for you. There’s a job come up. In Jamaica.
Personnel problem. Or that’s what it looks like. Routine investigation
and report. The sunshine’ll do you good and you
can practise your new guns on the turtles or whatever they
have down there. You can do with a bit of holiday. Like to
take it on?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond thought: He’s got it in for me over the last job. Feels
I let him down. Won’t trust me with anything tough. Wants
to see. Oh well! He said: “Sounds rather like the soft life, sir.
I’ve had almost too much of that lately. But if it’s got to be
done . . . If you say so, sir . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes,” said M. “I say so.”</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_3">III<br class="lgl"/> HOLIDAY TASK</h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">I</span><span class="sc">t was</span> getting dark. Outside the weather was thickening. M
reached over and switched on the green-shaded desklight.
The centre of the room became a warm yellow pool in which
the leather top of the desk glowed blood-red.</p>

<p class="pindent">M pulled the thick file towards him. Bond noticed it for the
first time. He read the reversed lettering without difficulty.
What had Strangways been up to? Who was Trueblood?</p>

<p class="pindent">M pressed a button on his desk. “I’ll get the Chief of Staff
in on this,” he said. “I know the bones of the case, but he can
fill in the flesh. It’s a drab little story, I’m afraid.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The Chief of Staff came in. He was a colonel in the Sappers,
a man of about Bond’s age, but his hair was prematurely grey
at the temples from the endless grind of work and responsibility.
He was saved from a nervous breakdown by physical toughness
and a sense of humour. He was Bond’s best friend at headquarters.
They smiled at each other.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Bring up a chair, Chief of Staff. I’ve given 007 the Strangways
case. Got to get the mess cleared up before we make a
new appointment there. 007 can be acting Head of Station in
the meantime. I want him to leave in a week. Would you fix
that with the Colonial Office and the Governor? And now let’s
go over the case.” He turned to Bond. “I think you knew
Strangways, 007. See you worked with him on that treasure
business about five years ago. What did you think of him?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Good man, sir. Bit highly strung, I’d have thought he’d
have been relieved by now. Five years is a long time in the
tropics.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M ignored the comment. “And his number two, this girl
Trueblood, Mary Trueblood. Ever come across her?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No, sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I see she’s got a good record. Chief Officer WRNS and
then came to us. Nothing against her on her Confidential
Record. Good-looker to judge from her photographs. That
probably explains it. Would you say Strangways was a bit of
a womanizer?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Could have been,” said Bond carefully, not wanting to say
anything against Strangways, but remembering the dashing
good looks. “But what’s happened to them, sir?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s what we want to find out,” said M. “They’ve gone,
vanished into thin air. Both went on the same evening about
three weeks ago. Left Strangways’s bungalow burned to the
ground—radio, codebooks, files. Nothing left but a few charred
scraps. The girl left all her things intact. Must have taken only
what she stood up in. Even her passport was in her room. But
it would have been easy for Strangways to cook up two passports.
He had plenty of blanks. He was Passport Control
Officer for the island. Any number of planes they could have
taken—to Florida or South America or one of the other islands
in his area. Police are still checking the passenger lists. Nothing’s
come up yet, but they could always have gone to ground
for a day or two and then done a bunk. Dyed the girl’s hair
and so forth. Airport security doesn’t amount to much in that
part of the world. Isn’t that so, Chief of Staff?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, sir.” The Chief of Staff sounded dubious. “But I still
can’t understand that last radio contact.” He turned to Bond.
“You see, they began to make their routine contact at eighteen-thirty
Jamaican time. Someone, Radio Security thinks it was
the girl, acknowledged our WWW and then went off the air.
We tried to regain contact but there was obviously something
fishy and we broke off. No answer to the Blue Call, or to the
Red. So that was that. Next day Section III sent 258 down
from Washington. By that time the police had taken over and
the Governor had already made up his mind and was trying
to get the case hushed up. It all seemed pretty obvious to him.
Strangways has had occasional girl trouble down there. Can’t
blame the chap myself. It’s a quiet station. Not much to occupy
his time. The Governor jumped to the obvious conclusions.
So, of course, did the local police. Sex and machete fights are
about all they understand. 258 spent a week down there and
couldn’t turn up a scrap of contrary evidence. He reported
accordingly and we sent him back to Washington. Since then
the police have been scraping around rather ineffectually and
getting nowhere.” The Chief of Staff paused. He looked
apologetically at M. “I know you’re inclined to agree with the
Governor, sir, but that radio contact sticks in my throat. I
just can’t see where it fits into the runaway-couple picture.
And Strangways’s friends at his club say he was perfectly
normal. Left in the middle of a rubber of bridge—always did,
when he was getting close to his deadline. Said he’d be back
in twenty minutes. Ordered drinks all round—again just as he
always did—and left the club dead on six-fifteen, exactly to
schedule. Then he vanished into thin air. Even left his car in
front of the club. Now, why should he set the rest of his
bridge four looking for him if he wanted to skip with the girl?
Why not leave in the morning, or better still, late at night, after
they’d made their radio call and tidied up their lives? It just
doesn’t make sense to me.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M grunted non-committally. “People in—er—love do
stupid things,” he said gruffly. “Act like lunatics sometimes.
And anyway, what other explanation is there? Absolutely no
trace of foul play—no reason for it that anyone can see. It’s
a quiet station down there. Same routines every month—an
occasional communist trying to get into the island from Cuba,
crooks from England thinking they can hide away just because
Jamaica’s so far from London. I don’t suppose Strangways
has had a big case since 007 was there.” He turned to Bond.
“On what you’ve heard, what do you think, 007? There’s not
much else to tell you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was definite. “I just can’t see Strangways flying off
the handle like that, sir. I daresay he was having an affair with
the girl, though I wouldn’t have thought he was a man to mix
business with pleasure. But the Service was his whole life.
He’d never have let it down. I can see him handing in his
papers, and the girl doing the same, and then going off with
her after you’d sent out reliefs. But I don’t believe it was in
him to leave us in the air like this. And from what you say of
the girl, I’d say it would be much the same with her. Chief
Officers WRNS don’t go out of their senses.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thank you, 007.” M’s voice was controlled. “These considerations
had also crossed my mind. No one’s been jumping
to conclusions without weighing all the possibilities. Perhaps
you can suggest another solution.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M sat back and waited. He reached for his pipe and began
filling it. The case bored him. He didn’t like personnel
problems, least of all messy ones like this. There were plenty
of other worries waiting to be coped with round the world.
It was only to give Bond the pretence of a job, mixed with a
good rest, that he had decided to send him out to Jamaica to
close the case. He put the pipe in his mouth and reached for
the matches. “Well?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond wasn’t going to be put off his stride. He had liked
Strangways and he was impressed by the points the Chief of
Staff had made. He said: “Well, sir. For instance, what was
the last case Strangways was working on? Had he reported
anything, or was there anything Section III had asked him to
look into. Anything at all in the last few months?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Nothing whatsoever.” M was definite. He took the pipe
out of his mouth and cocked it at the Chief of Staff. “Right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Right, sir,” said the Chief of Staff. “Only that damned
business about the birds.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh that,” said M contemptuously. “Some rot from the
Zoo or somebody. Got wished on us by the Colonial Office.
About six weeks ago, wasn’t it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s right, sir. But it wasn’t the Zoo. It was some people
in America called the Audubon Society. They protect rare
birds from extinction or something like that. Got on to our
Ambassador in Washington, and the FO passed the buck to
the Colonial Office. They shoved it on to us. Seems these bird
people are pretty powerful in America. They even got an atom
bombing range shifted on the West Coast because it interfered
with some birds’ nests.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M snorted. “Damned thing called a Whooping Crane. Read
about [it] in the papers.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond persisted. “Could you tell me about it, sir? What did
the Audubon people want us to do?”</p>

<p class="pindent">M waved his pipe impatiently. He picked up the Strangways
file and tossed it down in front of the Chief of Staff. “You tell
him, Chief of Staff,” he said wearily. “It’s all in there.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The Chief of Staff took the file and riffled through the
pages towards the back. He found what he wanted and bent
the file in half. There was silence in the room while he ran his
eye over three pages of typescript which Bond could see were
headed with the blue and white cipher of the Colonial Office.
Bond sat quietly, trying not to feel M’s coiled impatience
radiating across the desk.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Chief of Staff slapped the file shut. He said, “Well, this
is the story as we passed it to Strangways on January 20th.
He acknowledged receipt, but after that we heard nothing from
him.” The Chief of Staff sat back in his chair. He looked at
Bond. “It seems there’s a bird called a Roseate Spoonbill.
There’s a coloured photograph of it in here. Looks like a sort
of pink stork with an ugly flat bill which it uses for digging for
food in the mud. Not many years ago these birds were dying
out. Just before the war there were only a few hundred left in
the world, mostly in Florida and thereabouts. Then somebody
reported a colony of them on an island called Crab Key
between Jamaica and Cuba. It’s British territory—a dependency
of Jamaica. Used to be a guano island, but the quality
of the guano was too low for the cost of digging it. When the
birds were found there, it had been uninhabited for about
fifty years. The Audubon people went there and ended up by
leasing a corner as a sanctuary for these spoonbills. Put two
wardens in charge and persuaded the airlines to stop flying
over the island and disturbing the birds. The birds flourished
and at the last count there were about five thousand of them
on the island. Then came the war. The price of guano went
up and some bright chap had the idea of buying the island
and starting to work it again. He negotiated with the Jamaican
Government and bought the place for ten thousand pounds
with the condition that he didn’t disturb the lease of the
sanctuary. That was in 1943. Well, this man imported plenty
of cheap labour and soon had the place working at a profit and
it’s gone on making a profit until recently. Then the price of
guano took a dip and it’s thought that he must be having a
hard time making both ends meet.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Who is this man?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Chinaman, or rather half Chinese and half German. Got
a daft name. Calls himself Doctor No—Doctor Julius No.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No? Spelt like Yes?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s right.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Any facts about him?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Nothing except that he keeps very much to himself. Hasn’t
been seen since he made his deal with the Jamaican Government.
And there’s no traffic with the island. It’s his and he
keeps it private. Says he doesn’t want people disturbing the
guanay birds who turn out his guano. Seems reasonable. Well,
nothing happened until just before Christmas when one of the
Audubon wardens, a Barbadian, good solid chap apparently,
arrived on the north shore of Jamaica in a canoe. He was very
sick. He was terribly burned—died in a few days. Before he
died he told some crazy story about their camp having been
attacked by a dragon, with flames coming out of its mouth. This
dragon had killed his pal and burned up the camp and gone
roaring off into the bird sanctuary belching fire among the birds
and scaring them off to God knows where. He had been badly
burned but he’d escaped to the coast and stolen a canoe and
sailed all one night to Jamaica. Poor chap was obviously off his
rocker. And that was that, except that a routine report had to
be sent off to the Audubon Society. And they weren’t satisfied.
Sent down two of their big brass in a Beechcraft from Miami
to investigate. There’s an airstrip on the island. This Chinaman’s
got a Grumman Amphibian for bringing in supplies . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">M interjected sourly. “All these people seem to have a hell
of a lot of money to throw about on their damned birds.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond and the Chief of Staff exchanged smiles. M had been
trying for years to get the Treasury to give him an Auster for
the Caribbean Station.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Chief of Staff continued: “And the Beechcraft crashed
on landing and killed the two Audubon men. Well, that
aroused these bird people to a fury. They got a corvette from
the US Training Squadron in the Caribbean to make a call
on Doctor No. That’s how powerful these people are. Seems
they’ve got quite a lobby in Washington. The captain of the
corvette reported that he was received very civilly by Doctor
No but was kept well away from the guano workings. He was
taken to the airstrip and examined the remains of the plane.
Smashed to pieces, but nothing suspicious—came in to land
too fast probably. The bodies of the two men and the pilot had
been reverently embalmed and packed in handsome coffins
which were handed over with quite a ceremony. The captain
was very impressed by Doctor No’s courtesy. He asked to see
the wardens’ camp and he was taken out there and shown the
remains of it. Doctor No’s theory was that the two men had
gone mad because of the heat and the loneliness, or at any
rate that one of them had gone mad and burned down the
camp with the other inside it. This seemed possible to the
captain when he’d seen what a godforsaken bit of marsh
the men had been living in for ten years or more. There was
nothing else to see and he was politely steered back to his ship
and sailed away.” The Chief of Staff spread his hands. “And
that’s the lot except that the captain reported that he saw only
a handful of roseate spoonbills. When his report got back
to the Audubon Society it was apparently the loss of their
blasted birds that infuriated these people most of all, and ever
since then they’ve been nagging at us to have an inquiry into
the whole business. Of course nobody at the Colonial Office or
in Jamaica’s in the least interested. So in the end the whole
fairy story was dumped in our lap.” The Chief of Staff
shrugged his shoulders with finality. “And that’s how this pile
of bumf,” he waved the file, “or at any rate the guts of it, got
landed on Strangways.”</p>

<p class="pindent">M looked morosely at Bond. “See what I mean, 007? Just
the sort of mares’ nest these old women’s societies are always
stirring up. People start preserving something—churches, old
houses, decaying pictures, birds—and there’s always a hullabaloo
of some sort. The trouble is these sort of people get really
worked up about their damned birds or whatever it is. They
get the politicians involved. And somehow they all seem to
have stacks of money. God knows where it comes from. Other
old women, I suppose. And then there comes a point when
someone has to do something to keep them quiet. Like this
case. It gets shunted off on to me because the place is British
territory. At the same time it’s private land. Nobody wants to
interfere officially. So I’m supposed to do what? Send a submarine
to the island? For what? To find out what’s happened
to a covey of pink storks.” M snorted. “Anyway, you asked
about Strangways’s last case and that’s it.” M leant forward
belligerently. “Any questions? I’ve got a busy day ahead.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond grinned. He couldn’t help it. M’s occasional outbursts
of rage were so splendid. And nothing set him going so
well as any attempt to waste the time and energies and slim
funds of the Secret Service. Bond got to his feet. “Perhaps if I
could have the file, sir,” he said placatingly. “It just strikes me
that four people seem to have died more or less because of
these birds. Perhaps two more did—Strangways and the Trueblood
girl. I agree it sounds ridiculous, but we’ve got nothing
else to go on.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Take it, take it,” said M impatiently. “And hurry up and
get your holiday over. You may not have noticed it, but the
rest of the world happens to be in a bit of a mess.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond reached across and picked up the file. He also made
to pick up his Beretta and the holster. “No,” said M sharply.
“Leave that. And mind you’ve got the hang of the other two
guns by the time I see you again.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked across into M’s eyes. For the first time in his
life he hated the man. He knew perfectly well why M was
being tough and mean. It was deferred punishment, for having
nearly got killed on his last job. Plus getting away from this
filthy weather into the sunshine. M couldn’t bear his men to
have an easy time. In a way Bond felt sure he was being sent
on this cushy assignment to humiliate him. The old bastard.</p>

<p class="pindent">With the anger balling up inside him like cats’ fur, Bond
said, “I’ll see to it, sir,” and turned and walked out of the
room.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_4">IV<br class="lgl"/> RECEPTION COMMITTEE</h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="sc">he sixty-eight</span> tons deadweight of the Super Constellation
hurtled high above the green and brown chequerboard
of Cuba and, with only another hundred miles to go, started
its slow declining flight towards Jamaica.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond watched the big green turtle-backed island grow on
the horizon and the water below him turn from the dark blue
of the Cuba Deep to the azure and milk of the inshore shoals.
Then they were over the North Shore, over its rash of millionaire
hotels, and crossing the high mountains of the interior.
The scattered dice of small-holdings showed on the slopes and
in clearings in the jungle, and the setting sun flashed gold on
the bright worms of tumbling rivers and streams. ‘Xaymaca’
the Arawak Indians had called it—‘The Land of Hills and
Rivers’. Bond’s heart lifted with the beauty of one of the most
fertile islands in the world.</p>

<p class="pindent">The other side of the mountains was in deep violet shadow.
Lights were already twinkling in the foothills and spangling
the streets of Kingston, but, beyond, the far arm of the harbour
and the airport were still touched with the sun against
which the Port Royal lighthouse blinked ineffectually. Now
the Constellation was getting its nose down into a wide sweep
beyond the harbour. There was a slight thump as the tricycle
landing gear extended under the aircraft and locked into
position, and a shrill hydraulic whine as the brake flaps slid
out of the trailing edge of the wings. Slowly the great aircraft
turned in again towards the land and for a moment the setting
sun poured gold into the cabin. Then, the plane had dipped
below the level of the Blue Mountains and was skimming down
towards the single north-south runway. There was a glimpse
of a road and telephone wires. Then the concrete, scarred with
black skid-marks, was under the belly of the plane and there
was the soft double thump of a perfect landing and the roar of
reversing props as they taxied in towards the low white airport
buildings.</p>

<p class="pindent">The sticky fingers of the tropics brushed Bond’s face as he
left the aircraft and walked over to Health and Immigration.
He knew that by the time he had got through Customs he
would be sweating. He didn’t mind. After the rasping cold of
London, the stuffy, velvet heat was easily bearable.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s passport described him as ‘Import and Export
Merchant’.</p>

<p class="pindent">“What company, sir?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Universal Export.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Are you here on business or pleasure, sir?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Pleasure.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I hope you enjoy your stay, sir.” The Negro immigration
officer handed Bond his passport with indifference.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thank you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked out into the Customs hall. At once he saw the
tall brown-skinned man against the barrier. He was wearing
the same old faded blue shirt and probably the same khaki
twill trousers he had been wearing when Bond first met him
five years before.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Quarrel!”</p>

<p class="pindent">From behind the barrier the Cayman Islander gave a broad
grin. He lifted his right forearm across his eyes in the old
salute of the West Indians. “How you, cap’n?” he called
delightedly.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m fine,” said Bond. “Just wait till I get my bag through.
Got the car?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sure, cap’n.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The Customs officer who, like most men from the waterfront,
knew Quarrel, chalked Bond’s bag without opening it
and Bond picked it up and went out through the barrier.
Quarrel took it from him and held out his right hand. Bond
took the warm dry calloused paw and looked into the dark grey
eyes that showed descent from a Cromwellian soldier or a
pirate of Morgan’s time. “You haven’t changed, Quarrel,” he
said affectionately. “How’s the turtle fishing?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Not so bad, cap’n, an’ not so good. Much de same as
always.” He looked critically at Bond. “Yo been sick, or
somepun?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was surprised. “As a matter of fact I have. But I’ve
been fit for weeks. What made you say that?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel was embarrassed. “Sorry, cap’n,” he said, thinking
he might have offended Bond. “Dere some pain lines in yo
face since de las’ time.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh well,” said Bond. “It was nothing much. But I could
do with a spell of your training. I’m not as fit as I ought
to be.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sho ting, cap’n.”</p>

<p class="pindent">They were moving towards the exit when there came the
sharp crack and flash of a Press camera. A pretty Chinese girl
in Jamaican dress was lowering her Speed Graphic. She came
up to them. She said with synthetic charm, “Thank you,
gentlemen. I am from the <span class="it">Daily Gleaner</span>.” She glanced down
at a list in her hand. “Mister Bond, isn’t it? And how long will
you be with us, Mister Bond?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was offhand. This was a bad start. “In transit,” he
said shortly. “I think you’ll find there were more interesting
people on the plane.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh no, I’m sure not, Mister Bond. You look very important.
And what hotel will you be staying at?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Damn, thought Bond. He said “Myrtle Bank” and moved
on.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thank you, Mister Bond,” said the tinkling voice. “I hope
you’ll enjoy . . .”</p>

<p class="pindent">They were outside. As they walked towards the parking
place Bond said, “Ever seen that girl at the airport before?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel reflected. “Reck’n not, cap’n. But de <span class="it">Gleaner</span> have
plenty camera gals.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was vaguely worried. There was no earthly reason why
his picture should be wanted by the Press. It was five years
since his last adventures on the island, and anyway his name
had been kept out of the papers.</p>

<p class="pindent">They got to the car. It was a black Sunbeam Alpine. Bond
looked sharply at it and then at the number plate. Strangways’s
car. What the hell? “Where did you get this, Quarrel?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“ADC tell me fer to take him, cap’n. Him say hit de only
spare car dey have. Why, cap’n? Him no good?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, it’s all right, Quarrel,” said Bond resignedly. “Come
on, let’s get going.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got into the passenger seat. It was entirely his fault.
He might have guessed at the chance of getting this car. But
it would certainly put the finger on him and on what he was
doing in Jamaica if anyone happened to be interested.</p>

<p class="pindent">They moved off down the long cactus-fringed road towards
the distant lights of Kingston. Normally, Bond would have
sat and enjoyed the beauty of it all—the steady zing of the
crickets, the rush of warm, scented air, the ceiling of stars, the
necklace of yellow lights shimmering across the harbour—but
now he was cursing his carelessness and knowing what he
shouldn’t have done.</p>

<p class="pindent">What he <span class="it">had</span> done was to send one signal through the
Colonial Office to the Governor. In it he had first asked that
the ADC should get Quarrel over from the Cayman Islands for
an indefinite period on a salary of ten pounds a week. Quarrel
had been with Bond on his last adventure in Jamaica. He was
an invaluable handyman with all the fine seaman’s qualities of
the Cayman Islander, and he was a passport into the lower
strata of coloured life which would otherwise be closed to
Bond. Everybody loved him and he was a splendid companion.
Bond knew that Quarrel was vital if he was to get anywhere on
the Strangways case—whether it was a case or just a scandal.
Then Bond had asked for a single room and shower at the
Blue Hills Hotel, for the loan of a car and for Quarrel to meet
him with the car at the airport. Most of this had been wrong.
In particular Bond should have taken a taxi to his hotel and
made contact with Quarrel later. Then he would have seen
the car and had a chance to change it.</p>

<p class="pindent">As it was, reflected Bond, he might just as well have advertised
his visit and its purpose in the <span class="it">Gleaner</span>. He sighed. It
was the mistakes one made at the beginning of a case that were
the worst. They were the irretrievable ones, the ones that got
you off on the wrong foot, that gave the enemy the first game.
But was there an enemy? Wasn’t he being over-cautious? On
an impulse Bond turned in his seat. A hundred yards behind
were two dim sidelights. Most Jamaicans drive with their
headlights full on. Bond turned back. He said, “Quarrel. At
the end of the Palisadoes, where the left fork goes to Kingston
and right to Morant, I want you to turn quickly down the
Morant road and stop at once and turn your lights off. Right?
And now go like hell.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Okay, cap’n.” Quarrel’s voice sounded pleased. He put his
foot down to the floorboards. The little car gave a deep growl
and tore off down the white road.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now they were at the end of the straight. The car skidded
round the curve where the corner of the harbour bit into the
land. Another five hundred yards and they would be at the
intersection. Bond looked back. There was no sign of the other
car. Here was the signpost. Quarrel did a racing change and
hurled the car round on a tight lock. He pulled in to the side
and dowsed his lights. Bond turned and waited. At once he
heard the roar of a big car at speed. Lights blazed on, looking
for them. Then the car was past and tearing on towards
Kingston. Bond had time to notice that it was a big American
type taxicab and that there was no one in it but the driver.
Then it was gone.</p>

<p class="pindent">The dust settled slowly. They sat for ten minutes saying
nothing. Then Bond told Quarrel to turn the car and take the
Kingston road. He said, “I think that car was interested in us,
Quarrel. You don’t drive an empty taxi back from the airport.
It’s an expensive run. Keep a watch out. He may find we’ve
fooled him and be waiting for us.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sho ting, cap’n,” said Quarrel happily. This was just the
sort of life he had hoped for when he got Bond’s message.</p>

<p class="pindent">They came into the stream of Kingston traffic—buses, cars,
horse-drawn carts, pannier-laden donkeys down from the hills,
and the hand-drawn barrows selling violent coloured drinks.
In the crush it was impossible to say if they were being followed.
They turned off to the right and up towards the hills.
There were many cars behind them. Any one of them could
have been the American taxi. They drove for a quarter of an
hour up to Halfway Tree and then on to the Junction Road,
the main road across the island. Soon there was a neon sign of
a green palm tree and underneath ‘Blue Hills. THE hotel’.
They drove in and up the drive lined with neatly rounded
bushes of bougainvillaea.</p>

<p class="pindent">A hundred yards higher up the road the black taxi waved
the following drivers on and pulled in to the left. It made a
U-turn in a break in the traffic and swept back down the hill
towards Kingston.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Blue Hills was a comfortable old-fashioned hotel with
modern trimmings. Bond was welcomed with deference
because his reservation had been made by King’s House. He
was shown to a fine corner room with a balcony looking out
over the distant sweep of Kingston harbour. Thankfully he
took off his London clothes, now moist with perspiration, and
went into the glass-fronted shower and turned the cold water
full on and stood under it for five minutes during which he
washed his hair to remove the last dirt of big-city life. Then he
pulled on a pair of Sea Island cotton shorts and, with sensual
pleasure at the warm soft air on his nakedness, unpacked his
things and rang for the waiter.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond ordered a double gin and tonic and one whole green
lime. When the drink came he cut the lime in half, dropped the
two squeezed halves into the long glass, almost filled the glass
with ice cubes and then poured in the tonic. He took the drink
out on to the balcony, and sat and looked out across the
spectacular view. He thought how wonderful it was to be
away from headquarters, and from London, and from hospitals,
and to be here, at this moment, doing what he was doing and
knowing, as all his senses told him, that he was on a good
tough case again.</p>

<p class="pindent">He sat for a while, luxuriously, letting the gin relax him.
He ordered another and drank it down. It was seven-fifteen.
He had arranged for Quarrel to pick him up at seven-thirty.
They were going to have dinner together. Bond had asked
Quarrel to suggest a place. After a moment of embarrassment,
Quarrel had said that whenever he wanted to enjoy himself in
Kingston he went to a waterfront nightspot called the Joy
Boat. “Hit no great shakes, cap’n,” he had said apologetically,
“but da food an’ drinks an’ music is good and I got a good
fren’ dere. Him owns de joint. Dey calls him ‘Pus-Feller’
seein’ how him once fought wit’ a big hoctopus.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled to himself at the way Quarrel, like most West
Indians, added an ‘h’ where it wasn’t needed and took it off
when it was. He went into his room and dressed in his old
dark blue tropical worsted suit, a sleeveless white cotton shirt
and a black knitted tie, looked in the glass to see that the
Walther didn’t show under his armpit and went down and
out to where the car was waiting.</p>

<p class="pindent">They swooped down quietly through the soft singing dusk
into Kingston and turned to the left along the harbour side.
They passed one or two smart restaurants and night clubs from
which came the throb and twang of calypso music. There was
a stretch of private houses that dwindled into a poor-class
shopping centre and then into shacks. Then, where the road
curved away from the sea, there was a blaze of golden neon in
the shape of a Spanish galleon above green lettering that said
‘The Joy Boat’. They pulled into a parking place and Bond
followed Quarrel through the gate into a small garden of palm
trees growing out of lawn. At the end was the beach and the
sea. Tables were dotted about under the palms, and in the
centre was a small deserted cement dance floor to one side
of which a calypso trio in sequined scarlet shirts was softly
improvising on ‘Take her to Jamaica where the rum comes
from’.</p>

<p class="pindent">Only half the tables were filled, mostly by coloured people.
There was a sprinkling of British and American sailors with
their girls. An immensely fat Negro in a smart white dinner
jacket left one of the tables and came to meet them.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Hi, Mister Q. Long time no see. Nice table for two?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s right, Pus-Feller. Closer to da kitchen dan da
music.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The big man chuckled. He led them down towards the sea
and placed them at a quiet table under a palm tree that grew
out of the base of the restaurant building. “Drinks gemmun?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond ordered his gin and tonic with a lime, and Quarrel a
Red Stripe beer. They scanned the menu and both decided on
broiled lobster followed by a rare steak with native vegetables.</p>

<p class="pindent">The drinks came. The glasses were dripping with condensation.
The small fact reminded Bond of other times in hot
climates. A few yards away the sea lisped on the flat sand. The
three-piece began playing ‘Kitch’. Above them the palm fronds
clashed softly in the night breeze. A gecko chuckled somewhere
in the garden. Bond thought of the London he had left the
day before. He said, “I like this place, Quarrel.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel was pleased. “Him a good fren’ of mine, da Pus-Feller.
Him knows mostly what goes hon hin Kingston case
you got hany questions, cap’n. Him come from da Caymans.
Him an’ me once share a boat. Then him go hoff one day
catching boobies’ heggs hat Crab Key. Went swimmin’ to a
rock for more heggs an’ dis big hoctopus get him. Dey mos’ly
small fellers roun’ here but dey come bigger at da Crab seein’
how its alongside de Cuba Deep, da deepest waters roun’ dese
parts. Pus-Feller have himself a bad time wit dis hanimal. Bust
one lung cuttin’ hisself free. Dat scare him an’ him sell me his
half of da boat an’ come to Kingston. Dat were ’fore da war.
Now him rich man whiles I go hon fishin’.” Quarrel chuckled
at the quirk of fate.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Crab Key,” said Bond. “What sort of a place is that?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel looked at him sharply. “Dat a bad luck place now,
cap’n,” he said shortly. “Chinee gemmun buy hit durin’ da
war and bring in men and dig bird-dirt. Don’ let nobody land
dere and don’ let no one get hoff. We gives it a wide bert’.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Why’s that?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Him have plenty watchmen. An’ guns—machine guns.
An’ a radar. An’ a spottin’ plane. Fren’s o’ mine have landed
dere and him never been seen again. Dat Chinee keep him
island plenty private. Tell da trut’, cap’n,” Quarrel was
apologetic, “dat Crab Key scare me plenty.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said thoughtfully, “Well, well.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The food came. They ordered another round of drinks and
ate. While they ate, Bond gave Quarrel an outline of the
Strangways case. Quarrel listened carefully, occasionally asking
questions. He was particularly interested in the birds on Crab
Key, and what the watchmen had said, and how the plane
was supposed to have crashed. Finally he pushed his plate
away. He wiped the back of his hand across his mouth. He
took out a cigarette and lit it. He leant forward. “Cap’n,” he
said softly, “I no mind if hit was birds or butterflies or bees.
If dey was on Crab Key and da Commander was stickin’ his
nose into da business, yo kin bet yo bottom dollar him been
mashed. Him and him girl. Da Chinee mash dem for sho.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked carefully into the urgent grey eyes. “What
makes you so certain?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel spread his hands. To him the answer was simple. “Dat
Chinee love him privacy. Him want be left alone. I know him
kill ma frens order keep folk away from da Crab. Him a mos’
powerful man. Him kill hanyone what hinterfere with him.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Why?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’ rightly know, cap’n,” said Quarrel indifferently.
“People dem want different tings in dis world. An’ what dem
want sufficient dem gits.”</p>

<p class="pindent">A glint of light caught the corner of Bond’s eye. He turned
quickly. The Chinese girl from the airport was standing in
the nearby shadows. Now she was dressed in a tight-fitting
sheath of black satin slashed up one side almost to her hip.
She had a Leica with a flash attachment in one hand. The other
was in a leather case at her side. The hand came out holding a
flashbulb. The girl slipped the base into her mouth to wet it
and improve the contact and made to screw it into the reflector.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Get that girl,” said Bond quickly.</p>

<p class="pindent">In two strides Quarrel was up with her. He held out his
hand. “Evenin’, missy,” he said softly.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl smiled. She let the Leica hang on the thin strap
round her neck. She took Quarrel’s hand. Quarrel swung her
round like a ballet dancer. Now he had her hand behind her
back and she was in the crook of his arm.</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked up at him angrily. “Don’t. You’re hurting.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel smiled down into the flashing dark eyes in the
pale, almond-shaped face. “Cap’n like you take a drink wit’
we,” he said soothingly. He came back to the table, moving
the girl along with him. He hooked a chair out with his foot
and sat her down beside him, keeping the grip on her wrist behind
her back. They sat bolt upright, like quarrelling lovers.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked into the pretty, angry little face. “Good
evening. What are you doing here? Why do you want another
picture of me?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m doing the nightspots,” the Cupid’s bow of a mouth
parted persuasively. “The first picture of you didn’t come out.
Tell this man to leave me alone.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“So you work for the <span class="it">Gleaner</span>? What’s your name?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I won’t tell you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond cocked an eyebrow at Quarrel.</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel’s eyes narrowed. His hand behind the girl’s back
turned slowly. The girl struggled like an eel, her teeth clenched
on her lower lip. Quarrel went on twisting. Suddenly she said
“Ow!” sharply and gasped, “I’ll tell!” Quarrel eased his grip.
The girl looked furiously at Bond: “Annabel Chung.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said to Quarrel, “Call the Pus-Feller.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel picked up a fork with his free hand and clanged it
against a glass. The big Negro hurried up.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked up at him. “Ever seen this girl before?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, boss. She come here sometimes. She bein’ a nuisance?
Want for me to send her away?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No. We like her,” said Bond amiably, “but she wants to
take a studio portrait of me and I don’t know if she’s worth the
money. Would you call up the <span class="it">Gleaner</span> and ask if they’ve got a
photographer called Annabel Chung? If she really is one of
their people she ought to be good enough.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sure, boss.” The man hurried away.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled at the girl. “Why didn’t you ask that man to
rescue you?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl glowered at him.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m sorry to have to exert pressure,” said Bond, “but my
export manager in London said that Kingston was full of shady
characters. I’m sure you’re not one of them, but I really can’t
understand why you’re so anxious to get my picture. Tell me
why.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What I told you,” said the girl sulkily. “It’s my job.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond tried other questions. She didn’t answer them.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Pus-Feller came up. “That’s right, boss. Annabel
Chung. One of their freelance girls. They say she takes fine
pictures. You’ll be okay with her.” He looked bland. Studio
portrait! Studio bed, more like.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thanks,” said Bond. The Negro went away. Bond turned
back to the girl. “Freelance,” he said softly. “That still doesn’t
explain who wanted my picture.” His face went cold. “Now
give!”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No,” said the girl sullenly.</p>

<p class="pindent">“All right, Quarrel. Go ahead.” Bond sat back. His instincts
told him that this was the sixty-four thousand dollar question.
If he could get the answer out of the girl he might be saved
weeks of legwork.</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel’s right shoulder started to dip downwards. The girl
squirmed towards him to ease the pressure, but he held her
body away with his free hand. The girl’s face strained towards
Quarrel’s. Suddenly she spat full in his eyes. Quarrel grinned
and increased the twist. The girl’s feet kicked wildly under the
table. She hissed out words in Chinese. Sweat beaded on her
forehead.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Tell,” said Bond softly. “Tell and it will stop and we’ll be
friends and have a drink.” He was getting worried. The girl’s
arm must be on the verge of breaking.</p>

<p class="pindent">“—— you.” Suddenly the girl’s left hand flew up and into
Quarrel’s face. Bond was too slow to stop her. Something
glinted and there was a sharp explosion. Bond snatched at her
arm and dragged it back. Blood was streaming down Quarrel’s
cheek. Glass and metal tinkled on to the table. She had smashed
the flashbulb on Quarrel’s face. If she had been able to reach
an eye it would have been blinded.</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel’s free hand went up and felt his cheek. He put it in
front of his eyes and looked at the blood. “Aha!” There was
nothing but admiration and a feline pleasure in his voice. He
said equably to Bond, “We get nuthin out of dis gal, cap’n.
She plenty tough. You want fe me to break she’s arm?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Good God, no.” Bond let go the arm he was holding. “Let
her go.” He felt angry with himself for having hurt the girl
and still failed. But he had learned something. Whoever was
behind her held his people by a steel chain.</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel brought the girl’s right arm from behind her back.
He still held on to the wrist. Now he opened the girl’s hand.
He looked into her eyes. His own were cruel. “You mark me,
Missy. Now I mark you.” He brought up his other hand and
took the Mount of Venus, the soft lozenge of flesh in the palm
below her thumb, between his thumb and forefinger. He
began to squeeze it. Bond could see his knuckles go white with
the pressure. The girl gave a yelp. She hammered at Quarrel’s
hand and then at his face. Quarrel grinned and squeezed
harder. Suddenly he let go. The girl shot to her feet and backed
away from the table, her bruised hand at her mouth. She took
her hand down and hissed furiously. “He’ll get you, you
bastards!” Then, her Leica dangling, she ran off through the
trees.</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel laughed shortly. He took a napkin and wiped it
down his cheek and threw it on the ground and took up another.
He said to Bond, “She’s Love Moun’ be sore long after ma
face done get healed. Dat a fine piece of a woman, de Love
Moun’. When him fat like wit’ dat girl you kin tell her’ll be
good in bed. You know dat, cap’n?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No,” said Bond. “That’s new to me.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sho ting. Dat piece of da han’ most hindicative. Don’ you
worry ’bout she,” he added, noticing the dubious expression
on Bond’s face. “Hers got nuttin but a big bruise on she’s
Love Moun’. But boy, was dat a fat Love Moun’! I come back
after dat girl sometime, see if ma teory is da troof.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Appropriately the band started playing ‘Don’ touch me
tomato’. Bond said “Quarrel, it’s time you married and
settled down. And you leave that girl alone or you’ll get a knife
between your ribs. Now come on. We’ll get the check and go.
It’s three o’clock in the morning in London where I was
yesterday. I need a night’s sleep. You’ve got to start getting me
into training. I think I’m going to need it. And it’s about time
you put some plaster on that cheek of yours. She’s written her
name and address on it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel grunted reminiscently. He said with quiet pleasure,
“Dat were some tough baby.” He picked up a fork and clanged
it against his glass.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_5">V<br class="lgl"/> FACTS AND FIGURES</h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">‘H</span><span class="sc">e’ll get</span> you. . . . He’ll get you. . . . He’ll get you, you
bastards.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The words were still ringing in Bond’s brain the next day
as he sat on his balcony and ate a delicious breakfast and gazed
out across the riot of tropical gardens to Kingston, five miles
below him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now he was sure that Strangways and the girl had been
killed. Someone had needed to stop them looking any further
into his business, so he had killed them and destroyed the
records of what they were investigating. The same person
knew or suspected that the Secret Service would follow up
Strangways’s disappearance. Somehow he had known that
Bond had been given the job. He had wanted a picture of Bond
and he had wanted to know where Bond was staying. He would
be keeping an eye on Bond to see if Bond picked up any of
the leads that had led to Strangways’s death. If Bond did so,
Bond would also have to be eliminated. There would be a
car smash or a street fight or some other innocent death. And
how, Bond wondered, would this person react to their treatment
of the Chung girl? If he was as ruthless as Bond supposed,
that would be enough. It showed that Bond was on to something.
Perhaps Strangways had made a preliminary report to
London before he was killed. Perhaps someone had leaked.
The enemy would be foolish to take chances. If he had any
sense, after the Chung incident, he would deal with Bond and
perhaps also with Quarrel without delay.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond lit his first cigarette of the day—the first Royal Blend
he had smoked for five years—and let the smoke come out
between his teeth in a luxurious hiss. That was his ‘Enemy
Appreciation’. Now, who was this enemy?</p>

<p class="pindent">Well, there was only one candidate, and a pretty insubstantial
one at that, Doctor No, Doctor Julius No, the German
Chinese who owned Crab Key and made his money out of
guano. There had been nothing on this man in Records and a
signal to the FBI had been negative. The affair of the roseate
spoonbills and the trouble with the Audubon Society meant
precisely nothing except, as M had said, that a lot of old
women had got excited about some pink storks. All the same,
four people had died because of these storks and, most significant
of all to Bond, Quarrel was scared of Doctor No and
his island. That was very odd indeed. Cayman Islanders, least
of all Quarrel, did not scare easily. And why had Doctor No got
this mania for privacy? Why did he go to such expense and
trouble to keep people away from his guano island? Guano—bird
dung. Who wanted the stuff? How valuable was it? Bond
was due to call on the Governor at ten o’clock. After he had
made his number he would get hold of the Colonial Secretary
and try and find out all about the damned stuff and about Crab
Key and, if possible, about Doctor No.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a double knock on the door. Bond got up and unlocked
it. It was Quarrel, his left cheek decorated with a
piratical cross of sticking-plaster. “Mornin’, cap’n. Yo said
eight-tirty.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, come on in, Quarrel. We’ve got a busy day. Had some
breakfast?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, tank you, cap’n. Salt fish an’ ackee an’ a tot of rum.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Good God,” said Bond. “That’s tough stuff to start the
day on.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Mos’ refreshin’,” said Quarrel stolidly.</p>

<p class="pindent">They sat down outside on the balcony. Bond offered
Quarrel a cigarette and lit one himself. “Now then,” he said.
“I’ll be spending most of the day at King’s House and perhaps
at the Jamaica Institute. I shan’t need you till tomorrow
morning, but there are some things for you to do downtown.
All right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Okay, cap’n. Jes’ yo say.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“First of all, that car of ours is hot. We’ve got to get rid of
it. Go down to Motta’s or one of the other hire people and
pick up the newest and best little self-drive car you can find,
the one with the least mileage. Saloon. Take it for a month.
Right? Then hunt around the waterfront and find two men
who look as near as possible like us. One must be able to drive
a car. Buy them both clothes, at least for their top halves, that
look like ours. And the sort of hats we might wear. Say we
want a car taken over to Montego tomorrow morning—by the
Spanish Town, Ocho Rios road. To be left at Levy’s garage
there. Ring up Levy and tell him to expect it and keep it for
us. Right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel grinned. “Yo want fox someone?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s right. They’ll get ten pounds each. Say I’m a rich
American and I want my car to arrive in Montego Bay driven
by a respectable couple of men. Make me out a bit mad. They
must be here at six o’clock tomorrow morning. You’ll be here
with the other car. See they look the part and send them off in
the Sunbeam with the roof down. Right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Okay, cap’n.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What’s happened to that house we had on the North Shore
last time—Beau Desert at Morgan’s Harbour? Do you know
if it’s let?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Couldn’t say, cap’n. Hit’s well away from de tourist places
and dey askin’ a big rent for it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, go to Graham Associates and see if you can rent it for
a month, or another bungalow near by. I don’t mind what you
pay. Say it’s for a rich American, Mr James. Get the keys and
pay the rent and say I’ll write and confirm. I can telephone
them if they want more details.” Bond reached into his hip
pocket and brought out a thick wad of notes. He handed half
of it to Quarrel. “Here’s two hundred pounds. That should
cover all this. Get in touch if you want some more. You know
where I’ll be.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Tanks, cap’n,” said Quarrel, awestruck by the big sum.
He stowed it away inside his blue shirt and buttoned the shirt
up to his neck. “Anyting helse?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No, but take a lot of trouble about not being followed.
Leave the car somewhere downtown and walk to these places.
And watch out particularly for any Chinese near you.” Bond
got up and they went to the door. “See you tomorrow morning
at six-fifteen and we’ll get over to the North Coast. As far as
I can see that’s going to be our base for a while.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel nodded. His face was enigmatic. He said “Okay,
cap’n” and went off down the corridor.</p>

<p class="pindent">Half an hour later Bond went downstairs and took a taxi to
King’s House. He didn’t sign the Governor’s book in the cool
hall. He was put in a waiting room for the quarter of an hour
necessary to show him that he was unimportant. Then the
ADC came for him and took him up to the Governor’s
study on the first floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a large cool room smelling of cigar smoke. The
Acting Governor, in a cream tussore suit and an inappropriate
wing collar and spotted bow tie, was sitting at a broad
mahogany desk on which there was nothing but the <span class="it">Daily
Gleaner</span>, the <span class="it">Times Weekly</span> and a bowl of hibiscus blossoms.
His hands lay flat on the desk in front of him. He was sixtyish
with a red, rather petulant face and bright, bitter blue eyes.
He didn’t smile or get up. He said, “Good morning, Mr—er—Bond.
Please sit down.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took the chair across the desk from the Governor and
sat down. He said, “Good morning, sir,” and waited. A friend
at the Colonial Office had told him his reception would be
frigid. ‘He’s nearly at retiring age. Only an interim appointment.
We had to find an Acting Governor to take over at short
notice when Sir Hugh Foot was promoted. Foot was a great
success. This man’s not even trying to compete. He knows
he’s only got the job for a few months while we find someone
to replace Foot. This man’s been passed over for the Governor
Generalship of Rhodesia. Now all he wants is to retire and get
some directorships in the City. Last thing he wants is any
trouble in Jamaica. He keeps on trying to close this Strangways
case of yours. Won’t like you ferreting about.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Governor cleared his throat. He recognized that Bond
wasn’t one of the servile ones. “You wanted to see me?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Just to make my number, sir,” said Bond equably. “I’m
here on the Strangways case. I think you had a signal from the
Secretary of State.” This was a reminder that the people
behind Bond were powerful people. Bond didn’t like attempts
to squash him or his Service.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I recall the signal. And what can I do for you? So far as
we’re concerned here the case is closed.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“In what way ‘closed’, sir?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The Governor said roughly, “Strangways obviously did a
bunk with the girl. Unbalanced sort of fellow at the best of
times. Some of your—er—colleagues don’t seem to be able
to leave women alone.” The Governor clearly included Bond.
“Had to bail the chap out of various scandals before now.
Doesn’t do the Colony any good, Mr—er—Bond. Hope your
people will be sending us a rather better type of man to take
his place. That is,” he added coldly, “if a Regional Control
man is really needed here. Personally I have every confidence
in our police.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled sympathetically. “I’ll report your views, sir.
I expect my Chief will like to discuss them with the Minister
of Defence and the Secretary of State. Naturally, if you would
like to take over these extra duties it will be a saving in manpower
so far as my Service is concerned. I’m sure the Jamaican
Constabulary is most efficient.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The Governor looked at Bond suspiciously. Perhaps he had
better handle this man a bit more carefully. “This is an informal
discussion, Mr Bond. When I have decided on my
views I will communicate them myself to the Secretary of
State. In the meantime, is there anyone you wish to see on my
staff?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’d like to have a word with the Colonial Secretary, sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Really? And why, pray?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“There’s been some trouble on Crab Key. Something about
a bird sanctuary. The case was passed to us by the Colonial
Office. My Chief asked me to look into it while I’m here.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The Governor looked relieved. “Certainly, certainly. I’ll see
that Mr Pleydell-Smith receives you straight away. So you feel
we can leave the Strangways case to sort itself out? They’ll turn
up before long, never fear.” He reached over and rang a bell.
The ADC came in. “This gentleman would like to see the
Colonial Secretary, ADC. Take him along, would you? I’ll call
Mr Pleydell-Smith myself and ask him to make himself available.”
He got up and came round the desk. He held out his
hand. “Goodbye, then Mr Bond. And I’m so glad we see eye
to eye. Crab Key, eh? Never been there myself, but I’m sure it
would repay a visit.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shook hands. “That was what I was thinking. Goodbye,
sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Goodbye, goodbye.” The Governor watched Bond’s back
retreating out of the door and himself returned well satisfied
to his desk. “Young whippersnapper,” he said to the empty
room. He sat down and said a few peremptory words down the
telephone to the Colonial Secretary. Then he picked up the
<span class="it">Times Weekly</span> and turned to the Stock Exchange prices.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Colonial Secretary was a youngish shaggy-haired man
with bright, boyish eyes. He was one of those nervous pipe
smokers who are constantly patting their pockets for matches,
shaking the box to see how many are left in it, or knocking the
dottle out of their pipes. After he had gone through this
routine two or three times in his first ten minutes with Bond,
Bond wondered if he ever got any smoke into his lungs at all.</p>

<p class="pindent">After pumping energetically at Bond’s hand and waving
vaguely at a chair, Pleydell-Smith walked up and down the
room scratching his temple with the stem of his pipe. “Bond.
Bond. Bond! Rings a bell. Now let me see. Yes, by jove! You
were the chap who was mixed up in that treasure business here.
By jove, yes! Four, five years ago. Found the file lying around
only the other day. Splendid show. What a lark! I say, wish
you’d start another bonfire like that here. Stir the place up a
bit. All they think of nowadays is Federation and their bloody
self-importance. Self-determination indeed! They can’t even
run a bus service. And the colour problem! My dear chap,
there’s far more colour problem between the straight-haired
and the crinkly-haired Jamaicans than there is between me and
my black cook. However—” Pleydell-Smith came to rest beside
his desk. He sat down opposite Bond and draped one leg over
the arm of his chair. Reaching for a tobacco jar with the arms
of King’s College, Cambridge, on it, he dug into it and started
filling his pipe—“I mean to say I don’t want to bore you with
all that. You go ahead and bore me. What’s your problem?
Glad to help. I bet it’s more interesting than this muck,” he
waved at the pile of papers in his <span class="it">In</span> tray.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond grinned at him. This was more like it. He had found
an ally, and an intelligent one at that. “Well,” he said seriously,
“I’m here on the Strangways case. But first of all I want to ask
you a question that may sound odd. Exactly how did you come
to be looking at that other case of mine? You say you found the
file lying about. How was that? Had someone asked for it? I
don’t want to be indiscreet, so don’t answer if you don’t want
to. I’m just inquisitive.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Pleydell-Smith cocked an eye at him. “I suppose that’s your
job.” He reflected, gazing at the ceiling. “Well, now I come to
think of it I saw it on my secretary’s desk. She’s a new girl.
Said she was trying to get up to date with the files. Mark you,”
the Colonial Secretary hastened to exonerate his girl, “there
were plenty of other files on her desk. It was just this one that
caught my eye.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, I see,” said Bond. “It was like that.” He smiled
apologetically. “Sorry, but various people seem to be rather
interested in me being here. What I really wanted to talk to
you about was Crab Key. Anything you know about the place.
And about this Chinaman, Doctor No, who bought it. And
anything you can tell me about his guano business. Rather a
tall order, I’m afraid, but any scraps will help.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Pleydell-Smith laughed shortly through the stem of his
pipe. He jerked the pipe out of his mouth and talked while he
tamped down the burning tobacco with his matchbox. “Bitten
off a bit more than you can chew on guano. Talk to you for
hours about it. Started in the Consular before I transferred
to the Colonial Office. First job was in Peru. Had a lot to do
with their people who administer the whole trade—<span class="it">Campania
Aministradora del Guano</span>. Nice people.” The pipe was going
now and Pleydell-Smith threw his matchbox down on the
table. “As for the rest, it’s just a question of getting the file.”
He rang a bell. In a minute the door opened behind Bond.
“Miss Taro, the file on Crab Key, please. The one on the sale
of the place and the other one on that warden fellow who
turned up before Christmas. Miss Longfellow will know where
to find them.”</p>

<p class="pindent">A soft voice said, “Yes, sir.” Bond heard the door close.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Now then, guano.” Pleydell-Smith tilted his chair back.
Bond prepared to be bored. “As you know, it’s bird dung.
Comes from the rear end of two birds, the masked booby and
the guanay. So far as Crab Key is concerned, it’s only the
guanay, otherwise known as the green cormorant, same bird
as you find in England. The guanay is a machine for converting
fish into guano. They mostly eat anchovies. Just to show you
how much fish they eat, they’ve found up to seventy anchovies
inside one bird!” Pleydell-Smith took out his pipe and pointed
it impressively at Bond. “The whole population of Peru eats
four thousand tons of fish a year. The sea birds of the country
eat five hundred thousand tons!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond pursed his lips to show he was impressed. “Really.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, now,” continued the Colonial Secretary, “every day
each one of these hundreds of thousands of guanays eat a
pound or so of fish and deposit an ounce of guano on the
guanera—that’s the guano island.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond interrupted, “Why don’t they do it in the sea?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’t know.” Pleydell-Smith took the question and turned
it over in his mind. “Never occurred to me. Anyway they don’t.
They do it on the land and they’ve been doing it since before
Genesis. That makes the hell of a lot of bird dung—millions
of tons of it on the Pescadores and the other guanera. Then,
around 1850 someone discovered it was the greatest natural
fertilizer in the world—stuffed with nitrates and phosphates
and what have you. And the ships and the men came to the
guaneras and simply ravaged them for twenty years or more.
It’s a time known as the ‘Saturnalia’ in Peru. It was like the
Klondyke. People fought over the muck, hi-jacked each other’s
ships, shot the workers, sold phoney maps of secret guano
islands—anything you like. And people made fortunes out of
the stuff.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Where does Crab Key come in?” Bond wanted to get down
to cases.</p>

<p class="pindent">“That was the only worthwhile guanera so far north. It was
worked too, God knows who by. But the stuff had a low nitrate
content. Water’s not as rich round here as it is down along the
Humboldt Current. So the fish aren’t so rich in chemicals. So
the guano isn’t so rich either. Crab Key got worked on and off
when the price was high enough, but the whole industry went
bust, with Crab Key and the other poor-quality deposits in the
van, when the Germans invented artificial chemical manure.
By this time Peru had realized that she had squandered a
fantastic capital asset and she set about organizing the remains
of the industry and protecting the guanera. She nationalized
the industry and protected the birds, and slowly, very slowly,
the supplies built up again. Then people found that there were
snags about the German stuff, it impoverishes the soil, which
guano doesn’t do, and gradually the price of guano improved
and the industry staggered back to its feet. Now it’s going fine,
except that Peru keeps most of the guano to herself, for her
own agriculture. And that was where Crab Key came in again.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Ah.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes,” said Pleydell-Smith, patting his pockets for the
matches, finding them on the desk, shaking them against his
ear, and starting his pipe-filling routine, “at the beginning of
the war, this Chinaman, who must be a wily devil, by the way,
got the idea that he could make a good thing out of the old
guanera on Crab Key. The price was about fifty dollars a ton
on this side of the Atlantic and he bought the island from us,
for about ten thousand pounds as I recall it, brought in labour
and got to work. Been working it ever since. Must have made
a fortune. He ships direct to Europe, to Antwerp. They send
him a ship once a month. He’s installed the latest crushers and
separators. Sweats his labour, I daresay. To make a decent
profit, he’d have to. Particularly now. Last year I heard he was
only getting about thirty-eight to forty dollars a ton c.i.f.
Antwerp. God knows what he must pay his labour to make a
profit at that price. I’ve never been able to find out. He runs
that place like a fortress—sort of forced labour camp. No one
ever gets off it. I’ve heard some funny rumours, but no one’s
ever complained. It’s his island, of course, and he can do what
he likes on it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond hunted for clues. “Would it really be so valuable to
him, this place? What do you suppose it’s worth?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Pleydell-Smith said, “The guanay is the most valuable bird
in the world. Each pair produces about two dollars’ worth of
guano in a year without any expense to the owner. Each female
lays an average of three eggs and raises two young. Two broods
a year. Say they’re worth fifteen dollars a pair, and say there
are one hundred thousand birds on Crab Key, which is a
reasonable guess on the old figures we have. That makes his
birds worth a million and a half dollars. Pretty valuable property.
Add the value of the installations, say another million,
and you’ve got a small fortune on that hideous little place.
Which reminds me,” Pleydell-Smith pressed the bell, “what
the hell has happened to those files? You’ll find all the dope you
want in them.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The door opened behind Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">Pleydell-Smith said irritably, “Really, Miss Taro. What
about those files?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Very sorry, sir,” said the soft voice. “But we can’t find
them anywhere.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What do you mean ‘can’t find them’? Who had them last?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Commander Strangways, sir.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, I remember distinctly him bringing them back to
this room. What happened to them then?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Can’t say, sir,” the voice was unemotional. “The covers are
there but there’s nothing inside them.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned in his chair. He glanced at the girl and turned
back. He smiled grimly to himself. He knew where the files had
gone. He also knew why the old file on himself had been out on
the Secretary’s desk. He also guessed how the particular significance
of ‘James Bond, Import and Export Merchant’ seemed
to have leaked out of King’s House, the only place where the
significance was known.</p>

<p class="pindent">Like Doctor No, like Miss Annabel Chung, the demure,
efficient-looking little secretary in the horn-rimmed glasses was
a Chinese.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_6">VI<br class="lgl"/> THE FINGER ON THE TRIGGER</h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="sc">he Colonial Secretary</span> gave Bond lunch at Queen’s
Club. They sat in a corner of the elegant mahogany panelled
dining-room with its four big ceiling fans and gossiped
about Jamaica. By the time coffee came, Pleydell-Smith was
delving well below the surface of the prosperous, peaceful
island the world knows.</p>

<p class="pindent">“It’s like this.” He began his antics with the pipe. “The
Jamaican is a kindly lazy man with the virtues and vices of a
child. He lives on a very rich island but he doesn’t get rich from
it. He doesn’t know how to and he’s too lazy. The British come
and go and take the easy pickings, but for about two hundred
years no Englishman has made a fortune out here. He doesn’t
stay long enough. He takes a fat cut and leaves. It’s the Portuguese
Jews who make the most. They came here with the
British and they’ve stayed. But they’re snobs and they spend
too much of their fortunes on building fine houses and giving
dances. They’re the names that fill the social column in the
<span class="it">Gleaner</span> when the tourists have gone. They’re in rum and tobacco
and they represent the big British firms over here—motor
cars, insurance and so forth. Then come the Syrians,
very rich too, but not such good businessmen. They have most
of the stores and some of the best hotels. They’re not a very
good risk. Get overstocked and have to have an occasional fire
to get liquid again. Then there are the Indians with their usual
flashy trade in soft goods and the like. They’re not much of a
lot. Finally there are the Chinese, solid, compact, discreet—the
most powerful clique in Jamaica. They’ve got the bakeries
and the laundries and the best food stores. They keep to themselves
and keep their strain pure.” Pleydell-Smith laughed.
“Not that they don’t take the black girls when they want them.
You can see the result all over Kingston—Chigroes—Chinese
Negroes and Negresses. The Chigroes are a tough, forgotten
race. They look down on the Negroes and the Chinese look
down on them. One day they may become a nuisance. They’ve
got some of the intelligence of the Chinese and most of the vices
of the black man. The police have a lot of trouble with them.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “That secretary of yours. Would she be one of
them?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s right. Bright girl and very efficient. Had her for
about six months. She was far the best of the ones that answered
our advertisement.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“She looks bright,” said Bond non-committally. “Are they
organized, these people? Is there some head of the Chinese
Negro community?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Not yet. But someone’ll get hold of them one of these days.
They’d be a useful little pressure group.” Pleydell-Smith
glanced at his watch. “That reminds me. Must be getting
along. Got to go and read the riot act about those files. Can’t
think what happened to them. I distinctly remember . . .”
He broke off. “However, main point, is that I haven’t been
able to give you much dope about Crab Key and this doctor
fellow. But I can tell you there wasn’t much you’d have found
out from the files. He seems to have been a pleasant spoken
chap. Very businesslike. Then there was that argument with
the Audubon Society. I gather you know all about that. As for
the place itself, there was nothing on the files but one or two
pre-war reports and a copy of the last ordnance survey. God-forsaken
bloody place it sounds. Nothing but miles of mangrove
swamps and a huge mountain of bird dung at one end.
But you said you were going down to the Institute. Why don’t
I take you there and introduce you to the fellow who runs the
map section?”</p>

<p class="pindent">An hour later Bond was ensconced in a corner of a sombre
room with the ordnance survey map of Crab Key, dated 1910,
spread out on a table in front of him. He had a sheet of the
Institute’s writing-paper and had made a rough sketch-map
and was jotting down the salient points.</p>

<p class="pindent">The overall area of the island was about fifty square miles.
Three-quarters of this, to the east, was swamp and shallow
lake. From the lake a flat river meandered down to the sea
and came out halfway along the south coast into a small sandy
bay. Bond guessed that somewhere at the headwaters of the
river would be a likely spot for the Audubon wardens to have
chosen for their camp. To the west, the island rose steeply to
a hill stated to be five hundred feet high and ended abruptly
with what appeared to be a sheer drop to the sea. A dotted line
led from this hill to a box in the corner of the map which
contained the words <span class="it">Guano deposits. Last workings 1880.</span></p>

<p class="pindent">There was no sign of a road, or even of a track on the island,
and no sign of a house. The relief map showed that the island
looked rather like a swimming water rat—a flat spine rising
sharply to the head—heading west. It appeared to be about
thirty miles due north of Galina Point on the north shore of
Jamaica and about sixty miles south of Cuba.</p>

<p class="pindent">Little else could be gleaned from the map. Crab Key was
surrounded by shoal water except below the western cliff
where the nearest marking was five hundred fathoms. After
that came the plunge into the Cuba Deep. Bond folded the
map and handed it in to the librarian.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly he felt exhausted. It was only four o’clock, but it
was roasting in Kingston and his shirt was sticking to him.
Bond walked out of the Institute and found a taxi and went
back up into the cool hills to his hotel. He was well satisfied
with his day, but nothing else could be done on this side of the
island. He would spend a quiet evening at his hotel and be
ready to get up early next morning and be away.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond went to the reception desk to see if there was a message
from Quarrel. “No messages, sir,” said the girl. “But a basket
of fruit came from King’s House. Just after lunch. The messenger
took it up to your room.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What sort of a messenger?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Coloured man, sir. Said he was from the ADC’s office.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Thank you.” Bond took his key and went up the stairs
to the first floor. It was ridiculously improbable. His hand on
the gun under his coat, Bond softly approached his door. He
turned the key and kicked the door open. The empty room
yawned at him. Bond shut and locked the door. On his dressing
table was a large, ornate basket of fruit—tangerines, grapefruit,
pink bananas, soursop, star-apples and even a couple of hot-house
nectarines. Attached to a broad ribbon on the handle
was a white envelope. Bond removed it and held it up to the
light. He opened it. On a plain sheet of expensive white writing
paper was typed ‘With the Compliments of His Excellency the
Governor’.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond snorted. He stood looking at the fruit. He bent his ear
to it and listened. He then took the basket by the handle and
tipped its contents out on to the floor. The fruit bounced and
rolled over the coconut matting. There was nothing but fruit
in the basket. Bond grinned at his precautions. There was a
last possibility. He picked up one of the nectarines, the most
likely for a greedy man to choose first, and took it into the
bathroom. He dropped it in the washbasin and went back to
the bedroom and, after inspecting the lock, unlocked the wardrobe.
Gingerly he lifted out his suitcase and stood it in the
middle of the room. He knelt down and looked for the traces
of talcum powder he had dusted round the two locks. They
were smeared and there were minute scratches round the keyholes.
Bond sourly examined the marks. These people were
not as careful as some others he had had to deal with. He
unlocked the case and stood it up on end. There were four
innocent copper studs in the welting at the front right-hand
corner of the lid. Bond prised at the top one of these studs
with his nail and it eased out. He took hold of it and pulled
out three feet of thick steel wire and put it on the floor beside
him. This wire threaded through small wire loops inside the
lid and sewed the case shut. Bond lifted the lid and verified
that nothing had been disturbed. From his ‘tool case’ he took
out a jeweller’s glass and went back into the bathroom and
switched on the light over the shaving mirror. He screwed the
glass into his eye and gingerly picked the nectarine out of the
washbasin and revolved it slowly between finger and thumb.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stopped turning the nectarine. He had come to a
minute pinhole, its edges faintly discoloured brown. It was in
the crevice of the fruit, invisible except under a magnifying
glass. Bond put the nectarine carefully down in the washbasin.
He stood for a moment and looked thoughtfully into his eyes
in the mirror.</p>

<p class="pindent">So it <span class="it">was</span> war! Well, well. How very interesting. Bond felt
the slight tautening of the skin at the base of his stomach. He
smiled thinly at his reflection in the mirror. So his instincts
and his reasoning had been correct. Strangways and the girl
had been murdered and their records destroyed because they
had got too hot on the trail. Then Bond had come on the scene
and, thanks to Miss Taro, they had been waiting for him. Miss
Chung, and perhaps the taxi driver, had picked up the scent.
He had been traced to the Blue Hills hotel. The first shot had
been fired. There would be others. And whose finger was on
the trigger? Who had got him so accurately in his sights? Bond’s
mind was made up. The evidence was nil. But he was certain of
it. This was long-range fire, from Crab Key. The man behind
the gun was Doctor No.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked back into the bedroom. One by one he picked
up the fruit and took each piece back to the bathroom and
examined it through his glass. The pin-prick was always there,
concealed in the stalk-hole or a crevice. Bond rang down and
asked for a cardboard box and paper and string. He packed the
fruit carefully in the box and picked up the telephone and
called King’s House. He asked for the Colonial Secretary.
“That you, Pleydell-Smith? James Bond speaking. Sorry to
bother you. Got a bit of a problem. Is there a public analyst in
Kingston? I see. Well, I’ve got something I want analysed. If
I sent the box down to you, would you be very kind and pass
it on to this chap? I don’t want my name to come into this.
All right? I’ll explain later. When you get his report would
you send me a short telegram telling me the answer? I’ll be at
Beau Desert, over at Morgan’s Harbour, for the next week or
so. Be glad if you’d keep that to yourself too. Sorry to be so
damned mysterious. I’ll explain everything when I see you
next. I expect you’ll get a clue when you see what the analyst
has to say. And by the way, tell him to handle the specimens
carefully, would you. Warn him there’s more in them than
meets the eye. Very many thanks. Lucky I met you this
morning. Goodbye.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond addressed the parcel and went down and paid a taxi
to deliver it at once to King’s House. It was six o’clock. He
went back to his room and had a shower and changed and
ordered his first drink. He was about to take it out on the
balcony when the telephone rang. It was Quarrel.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Everyting fixed, cap’n.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Everything? That’s wonderful. That house all right?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Everyting okay.” Quarrel repeated, his voice careful. “See
yo as yo done said, cap’n.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Fine,” said Bond. He was impressed with Quarrel’s
efficiency and a sense of security. He put down the telephone
and went out on to the balcony.</p>

<p class="pindent">The sun was just setting. The wave of violet shadow was
creeping down towards the town and the harbour. When it hits
the town, thought Bond, the lights will go on. It happened as
he had expected. Above him there was the noise of a plane. It
came into sight, a Super Constellation, the same flight that
Bond had been on the night before. Bond watched it sweep
out over the sea and then turn and come in to land at the
Palisadoes airport. What a long way he had come since that
moment, only twenty-four hours before, when the door of the
plane had clanged open and the loudspeaker had said, ‘This is
Kingston, Jamaica. Will passengers please remain seated until
the aircraft has been cleared by the Health Authorities.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Should he tell M how the picture had changed? Should he
make a report to the Governor? Bond thought of the Governor
and dismissed that idea. But what about M? Bond had his
own cipher. He could easily send M a signal through the
Colonial Office. What would he say to M? That Doctor No
had sent him some poisoned fruit? But he didn’t even know
that it was poisoned, or, for the matter of that, that it had come
from Doctor No. Bond could see M’s face as he read the signal.
He saw him press down the lever on the intercom: “Chief of
Staff, 007’s gone round the bend. Says someone’s been trying
to feed him a poisoned banana. Fellow’s lost his nerve. Been
in hospital too long. Better call him home.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled to himself. He got up and rang down for
another drink. It wouldn’t be quite like that, of course. But
still . . . No, he’d wait until he had something more to show.
Of course if something went badly wrong, and he hadn’t sent
a warning, he’d be in trouble. It was up to him to see that
nothing did go wrong.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond drank his second drink and thought over the details of
his plan. Then he went down and had dinner in the half-deserted
dining-room and read the <span class="it">Handbook of the West
Indies</span>. By nine o’clock he was half asleep. He went back to his
room and packed his bag ready for the morning. He telephoned
down and arranged to be called at five-thirty. Then he bolted
the door on the inside, and also shut and bolted the slatted
jalousies across the windows. It would mean a hot, stuffy
night. That couldn’t be helped. Bond climbed naked under
the single cotton sheet and turned over on his left side and
slipped his right hand on to the butt of the Walther PPK under
the pillow. In five minutes he was asleep.</p>

<p class="pindent">The next thing Bond knew was that it was three o’clock in
the morning. He knew it was three o’clock because the luminous
dial of his watch was close to his face. He lay absolutely still.
There was not a sound in the room. He strained his ears.
Outside, too, it was deathly quiet. Far in the distance a dog
started to bark. Other dogs joined in and there was a brief
hysterical chorus which stopped as suddenly as it had begun.
Then it was quite quiet again. The moon coming through the
slats in the jalousies threw black and white bars across the
corner of the room next to his bed. It was as if he was lying
in a cage. What had woken him up? Bond moved softly, preparing
to slip out of bed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stopped moving. He stopped as dead as a live man can.</p>

<p class="pindent">Something had stirred on his right ankle. Now it was moving
up the inside of his shin. Bond could feel the hairs on his leg
being parted. It was an insect of some sort. A very big one. It
was long, five or six inches—as long as his hand. He could feel
dozens of tiny feet lightly touching his skin. What was it?</p>

<p class="pindent">Then Bond heard something he had never heard before—the
sound of the hair on his head rasping up on the pillow. Bond
analysed the noise. It couldn’t be! It simply couldn’t! Yes,
his hair was standing on end. Bond could even feel the cool
air reaching his scalp between the hairs. How extraordinary!
How very extraordinary! He had always thought it was a
figure of speech. But why? Why was it happening to him?</p>

<p class="pindent">The thing on his leg moved. Suddenly Bond realized that
he was afraid, terrified. His instincts, even before they had
communicated with his brain, had told his body that he had
a centipede on him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond lay frozen. He had once seen a tropical centipede in a
bottle of spirit on the shelf in a museum. It had been pale
brown and very flat and five or six inches long—about the
length of this one. On either side of the blunt head there
had been curved poison claws. The label on the bottle had
said that its poison was mortal if it hit an artery. Bond
had looked curiously at the corkscrew of dead cuticle and had
moved on.</p>

<p class="pindent">The centipede had reached his knee. It was starting up his
thigh. Whatever happened he mustn’t move, mustn’t even
tremble. Bond’s whole consciousness had drained down to the
two rows of softly creeping feet. Now they had reached his
flank. God, it was turning down towards his groin! Bond set
his teeth! Supposing it liked the warmth there! Supposing it
tried to crawl into the crevices! Could he stand it? Supposing
it chose that place to bite? Bond could feel it questing amongst
the first hairs. It tickled. The skin on Bond’s belly fluttered.
There was nothing he could do to control it. But now the
thing was turning up and along his stomach. Its feet were
gripping tighter to prevent it falling. Now it was at his heart.
If it bit there, surely it would kill him. The centipede trampled
steadily on through the thin hairs on Bond’s right breast up
to his collar bone. It stopped. What was it doing? Bond could
feel the blunt head questing blindly to and fro. What was it
looking for? Was there room between his skin and the sheet
for it to get through? Dare he lift the sheet an inch to help it.
No. Never! The animal was at the base of his jugular. Perhaps
it was intrigued by the heavy pulse there. Christ, if only he
could control the pumping of his blood. Damn you! Bond
tried to communicate with the centipede. It’s nothing. It’s
not dangerous, that pulse. It means you no harm. Get on out
into the fresh air!</p>

<p class="pindent">As if the beast had heard, it moved on up the column of the
neck and into the stubble on Bond’s chin. Now it was at the
corner of his mouth, tickling madly. On it went, up along the
nose. Now he could feel its whole weight and length. Softly
Bond closed his eyes. Two by two the pairs of feet, moving
alternately, trampled across his right eyelid. When it got off
his eye, should he take a chance and shake it off—rely on its
feet slipping in his sweat? No, for God’s sake! The grip of
the feet was endless. He might shake one lot off, but not the
rest.</p>

<p class="pindent">With incredible deliberation the huge insect ambled across
Bond’s forehead. It stopped below the hair. What the hell was
it doing now? Bond could feel it nuzzling at his skin. It was
drinking! Drinking the beads of salt sweat. Bond was sure
of it. For minutes it hardly moved. Bond felt weak with the
tension. He could feel the sweat pouring off the rest of his
body on to the sheet. In a second his limbs would start to
tremble. He could feel it coming on. He would start to shake
with an ague of fear. Could he control it, could he? Bond
lay and waited, the breath coming softly through his open,
snarling mouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">The centipede started to move again. It walked into the
forest of hair. Bond could feel the roots being pushed aside
as it forced its way along. Would it like it there? Would it
settle down? How did centipedes sleep? Curled up, or at full
length? The tiny centipedes he had known as a child, the ones
that always seemed to find their way up the plug-hole into the
empty bath, curled up when you touched them. Now it had
come to where his head lay against the sheet. Would it walk
out on to the pillow or would it stay on in the warm forest?
The centipede stopped. Out! OUT! Bond’s nerves screamed
at it.</p>

<p class="pindent">The centipede stirred. Slowly it walked out of his hair on to
the pillow.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond waited a second. Now he could hear the rows of feet
picking softly at the cotton. It was a tiny scraping noise, like
soft fingernails.</p>

<p class="pindent">With a crash that shook the room Bond’s body jackknifed
out of bed and on to the floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">At once Bond was on his feet and at the door. He turned
on the light. He found he was shaking uncontrollably. He
staggered to the bed. There it was crawling out of sight over
the edge of the pillow. Bond’s first instinct was to twitch the
pillow on to the floor. He controlled himself, waiting for his
nerves to quieten. Then softly, deliberately, he picked up the
pillow by one corner and walked into the middle of the room
and dropped it. The centipede came out from under the pillow.
It started to snake swiftly away across the matting. Now Bond
was uninterested. He looked round for something to kill it
with. Slowly he went and picked up a shoe and came back.
The danger was past. His mind was now wondering how the
centipede had got into his bed. He lifted the shoe and slowly,
almost carelessly, smashed it down. He heard the crack of the
hard carapace.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond lifted the shoe.</p>

<p class="pindent">The centipede was whipping from side to side in its agony—five
inches of grey-brown, shiny death. Bond hit it again. It
burst open, yellowly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond dropped the shoe and ran for the bathroom and was
violently sick.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_7">VII<br class="lgl"/> NIGHT PASSAGE</h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap1"><span class="calibre1">“B</span></span><span class="sc">y the way</span>, Quarrel—” Bond dared a bus with ‘Brown
Bomber’ painted above its windshield. The bus pulled
over and roared on down the hill towards Kingston sounding
a furious chord on its triple windhorn to restore the driver’s
ego, “—what do you know about centipedes?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Centipedes, cap’n?” Quarrel squinted sideways for a clue
to the question. Bond’s expression was casual. “Well, we got
some bad ones here in Jamaica. Tree, fo, five inches long.
Dey kills folks. Dey mos’ly lives in de old houses in Kingston.
Dey loves de rotten wood an’ de mouldy places. Dey hoperates
mos’ly at night. Why, cap’n? Yo seen one?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond dodged the question. He had also not told Quarrel
about the fruit. Quarrel was a tough man, but there was no
reason to sow the seeds of fear. “Would you expect to find
one in a modern house, for instance? In your shoe, or in a
drawer, or in your bed?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Nossir.” Quarrel’s voice was definite. “Not hunless dem
put dere a purpose. Dese hinsecks love de holes and de
crannies. Dey not love de clean places. Dey dirty-livin’
hinsecks. Mebbe yo find dem in de bush, under logs an’ stones.
But never in de bright places.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I see.” Bond changed the subject. “By the way, did those
two men get off all right in the Sunbeam?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sho ting, cap’n. Dey plenty happy wid de job. An’ dey
look plenty like yo an’ me, cap’n.” Quarrel chuckled. He
glanced at Bond and said hesitantly, “I fears dey weren’t very
good citizens, cap’n. Had to find de two men wheres I could.
Me, I’m a beggarman, cap’n. An’ fo you, cap’n, I get a misrable
no-good whiteman from Betsy’s.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Who’s Betsy?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“She done run de lousiest brothel in town, cap’n,” Quarrel
spat emphatically out of the window. “Dis whiteman, he does
de book-keepin’.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. “So long as he can drive a car. I only hope
they get to Montego all right.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’ yo worry,” Quarrel misunderstood Bond’s concern.
“I say I tell de police dey stole de car if dey don’.”</p>

<p class="pindent">They were at the saddleback at Stony Hill where the Junction
Road dives down through fifty S-bends towards the North
Coast. Bond put the little Austin A30 into second gear and
let it coast. The sun was coming up over the Blue Mountain
peak and dusty shafts of gold lanced into the plunging valley.
There were few people on the road—an occasional man going
off to his precipitous smallholding on the flank of a hill, his
three-foot steel cutlass dangling from his right hand, chewing
at his breakfast, a foot of raw sugar cane held in his left, or a
woman sauntering up the road with a covered basket of fruit
or vegetables for Stony Hill market, her shoes on her head, to
be donned when she got near the village. It was a savage,
peaceful scene that had hardly changed, except for the surface
of the road, for two hundred years or more. Bond almost
smelled the dung of the mule train in which he would have
been riding over from Port Royal to visit the garrison at Morgan’s
Harbour in 1750.</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel interrupted his thoughts. “Cap’n,” he said
apologetically, “beggin’ yo pardon, but kin yo tell me what
yo have in mind for we? I’se bin puzzlin’ an’ Ah caint seem
to figger hout yo game.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’ve hardly figured it out myself, Quarrel.” Bond changed
up into top and dawdled through the cool, beautiful glades of
Castleton Gardens. “I told you I’m here because Commander
Strangways and his secretary have disappeared. Most people
think they’ve gone off together. I think they’ve been murdered.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Dat so?” said Quarrel unemotionally. “Who yo tink done
hit?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’ve come to agree with you. I think Doctor No, that
Chinaman on Crab Key, had it done. Strangways was poking
his nose into this man’s affairs—something to do with the
bird sanctuary. Doctor No has this mania for privacy. You
were telling me so yourself. Seems he’ll do anything to stop
people climbing over his wall. Mark you, it’s not more than a
guess about Doctor No. But some funny things happened in
the last twenty-four hours. That’s why I sent the Sunbeam
over to Montego, to lay a false scent. And that’s why we’re
going to hide out at the Beau Desert for a few days.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Den what, cap’n?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“First of all I want you to get me absolutely fit—the way
you trained me the last time I was here. Remember?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sho, cap’n. Ah kin do dat ting.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“And then I was thinking you and me might go and take a
look at Crab Key.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel whistled. The whistle ended on a downward note.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Just sniff around. We needn’t get too close to Doctor No’s
end. I want to take a look at this bird sanctuary. See for myself
what happened to the wardens’ camp. If we find anything
wrong, we’ll get away again and come back by the front door—with
some soldiers to help. Have a full-dress inquiry. Can’t
do that until we’ve got something to go on. What do you
think?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel dug into his hip pocket for a cigarette. He made a
fuss about lighting it. He blew a cloud of smoke through his
nostrils and watched it whip out of the window. He said,
“Cap’n, Ah tink yo’se plumb crazy to trespass hon dat island.”
Quarrel had wound himself up. He paused. There was no
comment. He looked sideways at the quiet profile. He said
more quietly, in an embarrassed voice, “Jess one ting, cap’n.
Ah have some folks back in da Caymans. Would yo consider
takin’ hout a life hinsurance hon me afore we sail?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond glanced affectionately at the strong brown face. It had
a deep cleft of worry between the eyes. “Of course, Quarrel.
I’ll fix it at Port Maria tomorrow. We’ll make it big, say five
thousand pounds. Now then, how shall we go? Canoe?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Dat’s right, cap’n.” Quarrel’s voice was reluctant. “We
need a calm sea an’ a light wind. Come hin on de Nor-easterly
Trades. Mus’ be a dark night. Dey startin’ right now. By end
of da week we git da secon’ moon quarter. Where yo reckon
to land, cap’n?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“South shore near the mouth of the river. Then we’ll go up
the river to the lake. I’m sure that’s where the wardens’ camp
was. So as to have fresh water and be able to get down to the
sea to fish.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel grunted without enthusiasm. “How long we stayin’,
cap’n? Cain’t take a whole lot of food wit us. Bread, cheese, salt
pork. No tobacco—cain’t risk da smoke an’ light. Dat’s mighty
rough country, cap’n. Marsh an’ mangrove.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said: “Better plan for three days. Weather may break
and stop us getting off for a night or two. Couple of good
hunting knives. I’ll take a gun. You never can tell.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“No, sir,” said Quarrel emphatically. He relapsed into a
brooding silence which lasted until they got to Port Maria.</p>

<p class="pindent">They went through the little town and on round the headland
to Morgan’s Harbour. It was just as Bond remembered—the
sugar-loaf of the Isle of Surprise rising out of the calm
bay, the canoes drawn up beside the mounds of empty conch
shells, the distant boom of the surf on the reef which had so
nearly been his grave. Bond, his mind full of memories, took
the car down the little side road and through the cane fields
in the middle of which the gaunt ruin of the old Great House
of Beau Desert Plantation stood up like a stranded galleon.</p>

<p class="pindent">They came to the gate leading to the bungalow. Quarrel got
out and opened the gate, and Bond drove through and pulled
up in the yard behind the white single-storeyed house. It was
very quiet. Bond walked round the house and across the lawn
to the edge of the sea. Yes, there it was, the stretch of deep,
silent water—the submarine path he had taken to the Isle of
Surprise. It sometimes came back to him in nightmares. Bond
stood looking at it and thinking of Solitaire, the girl he had
brought back, torn and bleeding, from that sea. He had carried
her across the lawn to the house. What had happened to her?
Where was she? Brusquely Bond turned and walked back into
the house, driving the phantoms away from him.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was eight-thirty. Bond unpacked his few things and
changed into sandals and shorts. Soon there was the delicious
smell of coffee and frying bacon. They ate their breakfast
while Bond fixed his training routine—up at seven, swim a
quarter of a mile, breakfast, an hour’s sunbathing, run a mile,
swim again, lunch, sleep, sunbathe, swim a mile, hot bath and
massage, dinner and asleep by nine.</p>

<p class="pindent">After breakfast the routine began.</p>

<p class="pindent">Nothing interrupted the grinding week except a brief story
in the <span class="it">Daily Gleaner</span> and a telegram from Pleydell-Smith.
The <span class="it">Gleaner</span> said that a Sunbeam Talbot, H. 2473, had been
involved in a fatal accident on the Devil’s Racecourse, a stretch
of winding road between Spanish Town and Ocho Rios—on
the Kingston-Montego route. A runaway lorry, whose driver
was being traced, had crashed into the Sunbeam as it came
round a bend. Both vehicles had left the road and hurtled into
the ravine below. The two occupants of the Sunbeam, Ben
Gibbons of Harbour Street, and Josiah Smith, no address, had
been killed. A Mr Bond, an English visitor, who had been lent
the car, was asked to contact the nearest police station.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond burned that copy of the <span class="it">Gleaner</span>. He didn’t want to
upset Quarrel.</p>

<p class="pindent">With only one day to go, the telegram came from Pleydell-Smith.
It said:</p>

<div class="literal-container"><div class="literal"> <!-- rend=';fs:.8em;' -->
<p class="line5">EACH OBJECT CONTAINED ENOUGH CYANIDE TO KILL A HORSE</p>
<p class="line5">STOP SUGGEST YOU CHANGE YOUR GROCER STOP GOOD LUCK</p>
<p class="line6">SMITH</p>
</div></div> <!-- end rend -->

<p class="pindent">Bond also burned the telegram.</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel hired a canoe and they spent three days sailing it. It
was a clumsy shell cut out of a single giant cotton tree. It had
two thin thwarts, two heavy paddles and a small sail of dirty
canvas. It was a blunt instrument. Quarrel was pleased with it.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Seven, eight hours, cap’n,” he said. “Den we bring down
de sail an’ use de paddles. Less target for de radar to see.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The weather held. The forecast from Kingston radio was
good. The nights were as black as sin. The two men got in
their stores. Bond fitted himself out with cheap black canvas
jeans and a dark blue shirt and rope-soled shoes.</p>

<p class="pindent">The last evening came. Bond was glad he was on his way.
He had only once been out of the training camp—to get the
stores and arrange Quarrel’s insurance—and he was chafing
to get out of the stable and on to the track. He admitted to
himself that this adventure excited him. It had the right ingredients—physical
exertion, mystery, and a ruthless enemy.
He had a good companion. His cause was just. There might also
be the satisfaction of throwing the ‘holiday in the sun’ back in
M’s teeth. That had rankled. Bond didn’t like being coddled.</p>

<p class="pindent">The sun blazed beautifully into its grave.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond went into his bedroom and took out his two guns and
looked at them. Neither was a part of him as the Beretta had
been—an extension of his right hand—but he already knew
them as better weapons. Which should he take? Bond picked
up each in turn, hefting them in his hand. It had to be the
heavier Smith &amp; Wesson. There would be no close shooting,
if there was any shooting, on Crab Key. Heavy, long-range
stuff—if anything. The brutal, stumpy revolver had an extra
twenty-five yards over the Walther. Bond fitted the holster
into the waistband of his jeans and clipped in the gun. He
put twenty spare rounds in his pocket. Was it over-insurance
to take all this metal on what might only be a tropical picnic?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond went to the icebox and took a pint of Canadian Club
Blended Rye and some ice and soda-water and went and sat in
the garden and watched the last light flame and die.</p>

<p class="pindent">The shadows crept from behind the house and marched
across the lawn and enveloped him. The Undertaker’s Wind
that blows at night from the centre of the island, clattered
softly in the tops of the palm trees. The frogs began to tinkle
among the shrubs. The fireflies, the ‘blink-a-blinks’, as Quarrel
called them, came out and began flashing their sexual morse.
For a moment the melancholy of the tropical dusk caught at
Bond’s heart. He picked up the bottle and looked at it. He
had drunk a quarter of it. He poured another big slug into his
glass and added some ice. What was he drinking for? Because
of the thirty miles of black sea he had to cross tonight? Because
he was going into the unknown? Because of Doctor No?</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel came up from the beach. “Time, cap’n.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond swallowed his drink and followed the Cayman Islander
down to the canoe. It was rocking quietly in the water, its bows
on the sand. Quarrel went aft and Bond climbed into the space
between the forrard thwart and the bows. The sail, wrapped
round the short mast, was at his back. Bond took up his paddle
and pushed off, and they turned slowly and headed out for the
break in the softly creaming waves that was the passage through
the reef. They paddled easily, in unison, the paddles turning
in their hands so that they did not leave the water on the forward
stroke. The small waves slapped softly against the bows.
Otherwise they made no noise. It was dark. Nobody saw them
go. They just left the land and went off across the sea.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s only duty was to keep paddling. Quarrel did the
steering. At the opening through the reef there was a swirl
and suck of conflicting currents and they were in amongst
the jagged niggerheads and coral trees, bared like fangs by
the swell. Bond could feel the strength of Quarrel’s great
sweeps with the paddle as the heavy craft wallowed and
plunged. Again and again Bond’s own paddle thudded against
rock, and once he had to hold on as the canoe hit a buried
mass of brain coral and slid off again. Then they were through,
and far below the boat there were indigo patches of sand and
around them the solid oily feel of deep water.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Okay, cap’n,” said Quarrel softly. Bond shipped his paddle
and got down off one knee and sat with his back to the thwart.
He heard the scratching of Quarrel’s nails against canvas as
he unwrapped the sail and then the sharp flap as it caught the
breeze. The canoe straightened and began to move. It tilted
slowly. There was a soft hiss under the bows. A handful of
spray tossed up into Bond’s face. The wind of their movement
was cool and would soon get cold. Bond hunched up his knees
and put his arms round them. The wood was already beginning
to bite into his buttocks and his back. It crossed his mind that
it was going to be the hell of a long and uncomfortable night.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the darkness ahead Bond could just make out the rim of
the world. Then came a layer of black haze above which the
stars began, first sparsely and then merging into a dense bright
carpet. The Milky Way soared overhead. How many stars?
Bond tried counting a finger’s length and was soon past the
hundred. The stars lit the sea into a faint grey road and then
arched away over the tip of the mast towards the black silhouette
of Jamaica. Bond looked back. Behind the hunched
figure of Quarrel there was a faraway cluster of lights which
would be Port Maria. Already they were a couple of miles out.
Soon they would be a tenth of the way, then a quarter, then
half. That would be around midnight when Bond would take
over. Bond sighed and put his head down to his knees and
closed his eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">He must have slept because he was awakened by the clonk
of a paddle against the boat. He lifted his arm to show that
he had heard and glanced at the luminous blaze of his watch.
Twelve-fifteen. Stiffly he unbent his legs and turned and
scrambled over the thwart.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Sorry, Quarrel,” he said, and it was odd to hear his voice.
“You ought to have shaken me up before.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Hit don signify, cap’n,” said Quarrel with a grey glint of
teeth. “Do yo good to sleep.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Gingerly they slipped past each other and Bond settled in
the stern and picked up the paddle. The sail was secured to
a bent nail beside him. It was flapping. Bond brought the
bows into the wind and edged them round so that the North
Star was directly over Quarrel’s bent head in the bows. For
a time this would be fun. There was something to do.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was no change in the night except that it seemed
darker and emptier. The pulse of the sleeping sea seemed
slower. The heavy swell was longer and the troughs deeper.
They were running through a patch of phosphorus that winked
at the bows and dripped jewels when Bond lifted the paddle
out of the water. How safe it was, slipping through the night
in this ridiculously vulnerable little boat. How kind and soft
the sea could be. A covey of flying fish broke the surface in
front of the bows and scattered like shrapnel. Some kept going
for a time beside the canoe, flying as much as twenty yards
before they dived into the wall of the swell. Was some bigger
fish after them or did they think the canoe was a fish, or were
they just playing? Bond thought of what was going on in the
hundreds of fathoms below the boat, the big fish, the shark
and barracuda and tarpon and sailfish quietly cruising, the
shoals of kingfish and mackerel and bonito and, far below in
the grey twilight of the great depths, the phosphorous jellied
boneless things that were never seen, the fifty-foot squids,
with eyes a foot wide, that streamed along like zeppelins, the
last real monsters of the sea, whose size was only known from
the fragments found inside whales. What would happen if a
wave caught the canoe broadside and capsized them? How
long would they last? Bond took an ounce more pains with his
steering and put the thought aside.</p>

<p class="pindent">One o’clock, two o’clock, three, four. Quarrel awoke and
stretched. He called softly to Bond. “Ah smells land, cap’n.”
Soon there was a thickening of the darkness ahead. The low
shadow slowly took on the shape of a huge swimming rat. A
pale moon rose slowly behind them. Now the island showed
distinctly, a couple of miles away, and there was the distant
grumble of surf.</p>

<p class="pindent">They changed places. Quarrel brought down the sail and
they took up the paddles. For at least another mile, thought
Bond, they would be invisible in the troughs of the waves.
Not even radar would distinguish them from the crests. It was
the last mile they would have to hurry over with the dawn
not far off.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now he too could smell the land. It had no particular scent.
It was just something new in the nose after hours of clean sea.
He could make out the white fringe of surf. The swell subsided
and the waves became choppier. “Now, cap’n,” called
Quarrel, and Bond, the sweat already dropping off his chin,
dug deeper and more often. God, it was hard work! The hulking
log of wood which had sped along so well under the sail
now seemed hardly to move. The wave at the bows was only
a ripple. Bond’s shoulders were aching like fire. The one knee
he was resting on was beginning to bruise. His hands were
cramped on the clumsy shaft of a paddle made of lead.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was incredible, but they were coming up with the reef.
Patches of sand showed deep under the boat. Now the surf
was a roar. They followed along the edge of the reef, looking
for an opening. A hundred yards inside the reef, breaking the
sandline, was the shimmer of water running inland. The river!
So the landfall had been all right. The wall of surf broke up.
There was a patch of black oily current swelling over hidden
coral heads. The nose of the canoe turned towards it and into
it. There was a turmoil of water and a series of grating thuds,
and then a sudden rush forward into peace and the canoe was
moving slowly across a smooth mirror towards the shore.</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel steered the boat towards the lee of a rocky promontory
where the beach ended. Bond wondered why the
beach didn’t shine white under the thin moon. When they
grounded and Bond climbed stiffly out he understood why.
The beach was black. The sand was soft and wonderful to
the feet but it must have been formed out of volcanic rock,
pounded over the centuries, and Bond’s naked feet on it
looked like white crabs.</p>

<p class="pindent">They made haste. Quarrel took three short lengths of thick
bamboo out of the boat and laid them up the flat beach. They
heaved the nose of the canoe on to the first and pushed the
boat up the rollers. After each yard of progress, Bond picked
up the back roller and brought it to the front. Slowly the
canoe moved up the sand until at last it was over the back
tideline and among the rocks and turtle grass and low sea-grape
bushes. They pushed it another twenty yards inland
into the beginning of the mangrove. There they covered it
with dried seaweed and bits of driftwood from the tideline.
Then Quarrel cut lengths of screwpalm and went back over
their tracks, sweeping and tidying.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was still dark, but the breath of grey in the east would
soon be turning to pearl. It was five o’clock. They were dead
tired. They exchanged a few words and Quarrel went off
among the rocks on the promontory. Bond scooped out a
depression in the fine dry sand under a thick bush of sea-grape.
There were a few hermit crabs beside his bed. He
picked up as many as he could find and hurled them into
the mangrove. Then, not caring what other animals or insects
might come to his smell and his warmth, he lay down full
length in the sand and rested his head on his arm.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was at once asleep.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_8">VIII<br class="lgl"/> THE ELEGANT VENUS</h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">B</span><span class="sc">ond awoke</span> lazily. The feel of the sand reminded him
where he was. He glanced at his watch. Ten o’clock. The
sun through the round thick leaves of the sea-grape was already
hot. A larger shadow moved across the dappled sand in front
of his face. Quarrel? Bond shifted his head and peered through
the fringe of leaves and grass that concealed him from the
beach. He stiffened. His heart missed a beat and then began
pounding so that he had to breathe deeply to quieten it. His
eyes, as he stared through the blades of grass, were fierce slits.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a naked girl, with her back to him. She was not quite
naked. She wore a broad leather belt round her waist with a
hunting knife in a leather sheath at her right hip. The belt
made her nakedness extraordinarily erotic. She stood not more
than five yards away on the tideline looking down at something
in her hand. She stood in the classical relaxed pose of
the nude, all the weight on the right leg and the left knee bent
and turning slightly inwards, the head to one side as she
examined the things in her hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a beautiful back. The skin was a very light uniform
<span class="it">café au lait</span> with the sheen of dull satin. The gentle curve of
the backbone was deeply indented, suggesting more powerful
muscles than is usual in a woman, and the behind was almost
as firm and rounded as a boy’s. The legs were straight and
beautiful and no pinkness showed under the slightly lifted
left heel. She was not a coloured girl.</p>

<p class="pindent">Her hair was ash blonde. It was cut to the shoulders and
hung there and along the side of her bent cheek in thick wet
strands. A green diving mask was pushed back above her forehead,
and the green rubber thong bound her hair at the back.</p>

<p class="pindent">The whole scene, the empty beach, the green and blue sea,
the naked girl with the strands of fair hair, reminded Bond of
something. He searched his mind. Yes, she was Botticelli’s
Venus, seen from behind.</p>

<p class="pindent">How had she got there? What was she doing? Bond looked
up and down the beach. It was not black, he now saw, but a
deep chocolate brown. To the right he could see as far as the
river mouth, perhaps five hundred yards away. The beach was
empty and featureless except for a scattering of small pinkish
objects. There were a lot of them, shells of some sort Bond
supposed, and they looked decorative against the dark brown
background. He looked to the left, to where, twenty yards
away, the rocks of the small headland began. Yes, there was
a yard or two of groove in the sand where a canoe had been
drawn up into the shelter of the rocks. It must have been a
light one or she couldn’t have drawn it up alone. Perhaps
the girl wasn’t alone. But there was only one set of footprints
leading down from the rocks to the sea and another set
coming out of the sea and up the beach to where she now
stood on the tideline. Did she live here, or had she too sailed
over from Jamaica that night? Hell of a thing for a girl to do.
Anyway, what in God’s name <span class="it">was</span> she doing here?</p>

<p class="pindent">As if to answer him, the girl made a throwaway gesture of
the right hand and scattered a dozen shells on the sand beside
her. They were violent pink and seemed to Bond to be the
same as he had noticed on the beach. The girl looked down
into her left hand and began to whistle softly to herself. There
was a happy note of triumph in the whistle. She was whistling
‘Marion’, a plaintive little calypso that has now been cleaned
up and made famous outside Jamaica. It had always been one
of Bond’s favourites. It went:</p>


          <div class="poetry-container">
          <div class="literal"> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class="lgl">
<p class="line7">All day, all night, Marion,</p>
<p class="line7">Sittin’ by the seaside siftin’ sand . . .</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class="pindent">The girl broke off to stretch her arms out in a deep yawn.
Bond smiled to himself. He wetted his lips and took up the
refrain:</p>


          <div class="poetry-container">
          <div class="literal"> <!-- rend=';' -->
<div class="lgl">
<p class="line7">“The water from her eyes could sail a boat,</p>
<p class="line7">The hair on her head could tie a goat . . .”</p>
</div>
</div></div> <!-- end poetry block --><!-- end rend -->

<p class="pindent">The hands flew down and across her chest. The muscles of
her behind bunched with tension. She was listening, her head,
still hidden by the curtain of hair, cocked to one side.</p>

<p class="pindent">Hesitantly she began again. The whistle trembled and died.
At the first note of Bond’s echo, the girl whirled round. She
didn’t cover her body with the two classical gestures. One
hand flew downwards, but the other, instead of hiding her
breasts, went up to her face, covering it below the eyes, now
wide with fear. “Who’s that?” The words came out in a
terrified whisper.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got to his feet and stepped out through the sea-grape.
He stopped on the edge of the grass. He held his hands open at
his sides to show they were empty. He smiled cheerfully at her.
“It’s only me. I’m another trespasser. Don’t be frightened.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl dropped her hand down from her face. It went to
the knife at her belt. Bond watched the fingers curl round the
hilt. He looked up at her face. Now he realized why her hand
had instinctively gone to it. It was a beautiful face, with wide-apart
deep blue eyes under lashes paled by the sun. The mouth
was wide and when she stopped pursing the lips with tension
they would be full. It was a serious face and the jawline was
determined—the face of a girl who fends for herself. And once,
reflected Bond, she had failed to fend. For the nose was badly
broken, smashed crooked like a boxer’s. Bond stiffened with
revolt at what had happened to this supremely beautiful girl.
No wonder this was her shame and not the beautiful firm
breasts that now jutted towards him without concealment.</p>

<p class="pindent">The eyes examined him fiercely. “Who are you? What are
you doing here?” There was the slight lilt of a Jamaican accent.
The voice was sharp and accustomed to being obeyed.</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m an Englishman. I’m interested in birds.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh,” the voice was doubtful. The hand still rested on the
knife. “How long have you been watching me? How did you
get here?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Ten minutes, but no more answers until you tell me who
<span class="it">you</span> are.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’m no one in particular. I come from Jamaica. I collect
shells.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I came in a canoe. Did you?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes. Where is your canoe?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I’ve got a friend with me. We’ve hidden it in the mangroves.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“There are no marks of a canoe landing.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“We’re careful. We covered them up. Not like you.” Bond
gestured towards the rocks. “You ought to take more trouble.
Did you use a sail? Right up to the reef?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Of course. Why not? I always do.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Then they’ll know you’re here. They’ve got radar.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“They’ve never caught me yet.” The girl took her hand away
from her knife. She reached up and stripped off the diving
mask and stood swinging it. She seemed to think she had the
measure of Bond. She said, with some of the sharpness gone
from her voice, “What’s your name?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Bond. James Bond. What’s yours?”</p>

<p class="pindent">She reflected. “Rider.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What Rider?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Honeychile.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled.</p>

<p class="pindent">“What’s so funny about it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Nothing. Honeychile Rider. It’s a pretty name.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She unbent. “People call me ‘Honey’.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, I’m glad to meet you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The prosaic phrase seemed to remind her of her nakedness.
She blushed. She said uncertainly, “I must get dressed.” She
looked down at the scattered shells around her feet. She
obviously wanted to pick them up. Perhaps she realized that the
movement might be still more revealing than her present pose.
She said sharply, “You’re not to touch those while I’m gone.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled at the childish challenge. “Don’t worry, I’ll
look after them.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl looked at him doubtfully and then turned and
walked stiff-legged over to the rocks and disappeared behind
them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked the few steps down the beach and bent and
picked up one of the shells. It was alive and the two halves
were shut tight. It appeared to be some kind of a cockle,
rather deeply ribbed and coloured a mauve-pink. Along both
edges of the hinge, thin horns stood out, about half a dozen to
each side. It didn’t seem to Bond a very distinguished shell.
He replaced it carefully with the others.</p>

<p class="pindent">He stood looking down at the shells and wondering. Was
she really collecting them? It certainly looked like it. But what
a risk to take to get them—the voyage over alone in the canoe
and then back again. And she seemed to realize that this was
a dangerous place. “They’ve never caught me yet.” What an
extraordinary girl. Bond’s heart warmed and his senses stirred
as he thought of her. Already, as he had found so often when
people had deformities, he had almost forgotten her broken
nose. It had somehow slipped away behind his memory of her
eyes and her mouth and her amazingly beautiful body. Her
imperious attitude and her quality of attack were exciting. The
way she had reached for her knife to defend herself! She was
like an animal whose cubs are threatened. Where did she live?
Who were her parents? There was something uncared for about
her—a dog that nobody wants to pet. Who was she?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond heard her footsteps riffling the sand. He turned to look
at her. She was dressed almost in rags—a faded brown shirt
with torn sleeves and a knee-length patched brown cotton
skirt held in place by the leather belt with the knife. She had a
canvas knapsack slung over one shoulder. She looked like a
principal girl dressed as Man Friday.</p>

<p class="pindent">She came up with him and at once went down on one knee
and began picking up the live shells and stowing them in the
knapsack.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “Are those rare?”</p>

<p class="pindent">She sat back on her haunches and looked up at him. She
surveyed his face. Apparently she was satisfied. “You promise
you won’t tell anybody? Swear?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I promise,” said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well then, yes, they are rare. Very. You can get five dollars
for a perfect specimen. In Miami. That’s where I deal with.
They’re called <span class="it">Venus Elegans</span>—The Elegant Venus.” Her eyes
sparkled up at him with excitement. “This morning I found
what I wanted. The bed where they live,” she waved towards
the sea. “You wouldn’t find it though,” she added with
sudden carefulness. “It’s very deep and hidden away. I doubt
if you could dive that deep. And anyway,” she looked happy,
“I’m going to clear the whole bed today. You’d only get the
imperfect ones if you came back here.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. “I promise I won’t steal any. I really don’t
know anything about shells. Cross my heart.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She stood up, her work completed. “What about these birds
of yours? What sort are they? Are they valuable too? I won’t
tell either if you tell me. I only collect shells.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“They’re called roseate spoonbills,” said Bond. “Sort of
pink stork with a flat beak. Ever seen any?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, <span class="it">those</span>,” she said scornfully. “There used to be thousands
of them here. But you won’t find many now. They
scared them all away.” She sat down on the sand and put her
arms round her knees, proud of her superior knowledge and
now certain that she had nothing to fear from this man.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat down a yard away. He stretched out and turned
towards her, resting on his elbow. He wanted to preserve the
picnic atmosphere and try to find out more about this queer,
beautiful girl. He said, easily, “Oh, really. What happened?
Who did it?”</p>

<p class="pindent">She shrugged impatiently. “The people here did it. I don’t
know who they are. There’s a Chinaman. He doesn’t like birds
or something. He’s got a dragon. He sent the dragon after the
birds and scared them away. The dragon burned up their
nesting places. There used to be two men who lived with the
birds and looked after them. They got scared away too, or
killed or something.”</p>

<p class="pindent">It all seemed quite natural to her. She gave the facts indifferently,
staring out to sea.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “This dragon. What kind is he? Have you ever
seen him?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, I’ve seen him.” She screwed up her eyes and made a
wry face as if she was swallowing bitter medicine. She looked
earnestly at Bond to make him share her feelings. “I’ve been
coming here for about a year, looking for shells and exploring.
I only found these,” she waved at the beach, “about a month
ago. On my last trip. But I’ve found plenty of other good ones.
Just before Christmas I thought I’d explore the river. I went
up it to the top, where the birdmen had their camp. It was all
broken up. It was getting late and I decided to spend the night
there. In the middle of the night I woke up. The dragon was
coming by only a few chains away from me. It had two great
glaring eyes and a long snout. It had sort of short wings and a
pointed tail. It was all black and gold.” She frowned at the
expression on Bond’s face. “There was a full moon. I could see
it quite clearly. It went by me. It was making a sort of roaring
noise. It went over the marsh and came to some thick mangrove
and it simply climbed over the bushes and went on. A
whole flock of birds got up in front of it and suddenly a lot of
fire came out of its mouth and it burned a lot of them up and
all the trees they’d been roosting in. It was horrible. The most
horrible thing I’ve ever seen.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl leant sideways and peered at Bond’s face. She sat
up straight again and stared obstinately out to sea. “I can see
you don’t believe me,” she said in a furious, tense voice.
“You’re one of these city people. You don’t believe anything.
Ugh,” she shuddered with dislike of him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said reasonably, “Honey, there just aren’t such things
as dragons in the world. You saw something that looked very
like a dragon. I’m just wondering what it was.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“How do you know there aren’t such things as dragons?”
Now he had made her really angry. “Nobody lives on this
end of the island. One could easily have survived here. Anyway,
what do you think you know about animals and things? I’ve
lived with snakes and things since I was a child. Alone. Have
you ever seen a praying mantis eat her husband after they’ve
made love? Have you ever seen the mongoose dance? Or an
octopus dance? How long is a humming bird’s tongue? Have
you ever had a pet snake that wore a bell round its neck and
rang it to wake you? Have you seen a scorpion get sunstroke
and kill itself with its own sting? Have you seen the carpet of
flowers under the sea at night? Do you know that a John Crow
can smell a dead lizard a mile away . . . ?” The girl had fired
these questions like scornful jabs with a rapier. Now she
stopped, out of breath. She said hopelessly, “Oh, you’re just
city folk like all the rest.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “Honey, now look here. You know these things.
I can’t help it that I live in towns. I’d like to know about your
things too. I just haven’t had that sort of life. I know other
things instead. Like . . .” Bond searched his mind. He couldn’t
think of anything as interesting as hers. He finished lamely,
“Like for instance that this Chinaman is going to be more
interested in your visit this time. This time he’s going to try
and stop you getting away.” He paused and added. “And me
for the matter of that.”</p>

<p class="pindent">She turned and looked at him with interest. “Oh. Why?
But then it doesn’t really matter. One just hides during the
day and gets away at night. He’s sent dogs after me and even
a plane. He hasn’t got me yet.” She examined Bond with a
new interest. “Is it you he’s after?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Well, yes,” admitted Bond. “I’m afraid it is. You see we
dropped the sail about two miles out so that their radar
wouldn’t pick us up. I think the Chinaman may have been
expecting a visit from me. Your sail will have been reported
and I’d bet anything he’ll think your canoe was mine. I’d
better go and wake my friend up and we’ll talk it over. You’ll
like him. He’s a Cayman Islander, name of Quarrel.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl said, “Well, I’m sorry if . . .” the sentence trailed
away. Apologies wouldn’t come easy to someone so much on
the defensive. “But after all I couldn’t know, could I?” She
searched his face.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled into the questing blue eyes. He said reassuringly,
“Of course you couldn’t. It’s just bad luck—bad luck
for you too. I don’t suppose he minds too much about a
solitary girl who collects shells. You can be sure they’ve had a
good look at your footprints and found clues like that”—he
waved at the scattered shells on the beach. “But I’m afraid
he’d take a different view of me. Now he’ll try and hunt me
down with everything he’s got. I’m only afraid he may get
you into the net in the process. Anyway,” Bond grinned reassuringly,
“we’ll see what Quarrel has to say. You stay here.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got to his feet. He walked along the promontory and
cast about him. Quarrel had hidden himself well. It took Bond
five minutes to find him. He was lying in a grassy depression
between two big rocks, half covered by a board of grey driftwood.
He was still fast asleep, the brown head, stern in sleep,
cradled on his forearm. Bond whistled softly and smiled as the
eyes sprang wide open like an animal’s. Quarrel saw Bond and
scrambled to his feet, almost guiltily. He rubbed his big hands
over his face as if he was washing it.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Mornin’, cap’n,” he said. “Guess Ah been down deep. Dat
China girl come to me.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled. “I got something different,” he said. They sat
down and Bond told him about Honeychile Rider and her
shells and the fix they were in. “And now it’s eleven o’clock,”
Bond added. “And we’ve got to make a new plan.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel scratched his head. He looked sideways at Bond.
“Yo don’ plan we jess ditch dis girl?” he asked hopefully.
“Ain’t nuttin to do wit we . . .” Suddenly he stopped. His head
swivelled round and pointed like a dog’s. He held up a hand
for silence, listening intently.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond held his breath. In the distance, to the eastwards,
there was a faint droning.</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel jumped to his feet. “Quick, cap’n,” he said urgently.
“Dey’s a comin’.”</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_9">IX<br class="lgl"/> CLOSE SHAVES</h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="sc">en minutes</span> later the bay was empty and immaculate.
Small waves curled lazily in across the mirrored water
inside the reef and flopped exhausted on the dark sand where
the mauve shells glittered like shed toenails. The heap of discarded
shells had gone and there was no longer any trace of
footprints. Quarrel had cut branches of mangrove and had
walked backwards sweeping carefully as he went. Where he
had swept, the sand was of a different texture from the rest of
the beach, but not too different as to be noticed from outside
the reef. The girl’s canoe had been pulled deeper among the
rocks and covered with seaweed and driftwood.</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel had gone back to the headland. Bond and the girl
lay a few feet apart under the bush of sea-grape where Bond
had slept, and gazed silently out across the water to the corner
of the headland round which the boat would come.</p>

<p class="pindent">The boat was perhaps a quarter of a mile away. From the
slow pulse of the twin diesels Bond guessed that every cranny
of the coastline was being searched for signs of them. It
sounded a powerful boat. A big cabin cruiser, perhaps. What
crew would it have? Who would be in command of the search?
Doctor No? Unlikely. He would not trouble himself with this
kind of police work.</p>

<p class="pindent">From the west a wedge of cormorants appeared, flying low
over the sea beyond the reef. Bond watched them. They were
the first evidence he had seen of the guanay colony at the other
end of the island. These, according to Pleydell-Smith’s description,
would be scouts for the silver flash of the anchovy
near the surface. Sure enough, as he watched, they began to
back-pedal in the air and then go into shallow dives, hitting
the water like shrapnel. Almost at once a fresh file appeared
from the west, then another and another that merged into a
long stream and then into a solid black river of birds. For
minutes they darkened the skyline and then they were down
on the water, covering several acres of it, screeching and
fighting and plunging their heads below the surface, cropping
at the solid field of anchovy like piranha fish feasting on a
drowned horse.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond felt a gentle nudge from the girl. She gestured with her
head. “The Chinaman’s hens getting their corn.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond examined the happy, beautiful face. She had seemed
quite unconcerned by the arrival of the search party. To her it
was only the game of hide-and-seek she had played before.
Bond hoped she wasn’t going to get a shock.</p>

<p class="pindent">The iron thud of the diesels was getting louder. The boat
must be just behind the headland. Bond took a last look
round the peaceful bay and then fixed his eyes, through the
leaves and grass, on the point of the headland inside the reef.</p>

<p class="pindent">The knife of white bows appeared. It was followed by ten
yards of empty polished deck, glass windshields, a low raked
cabin with a siren and a blunt radio mast, the glimpse of a
man inside at the wheel, then the long flat well of the stern and
a drooping red ensign. Converted MTB, British Government
surplus?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s eyes went to the two men standing in the stern. They
were pale-skinned Negroes. They wore neat khaki ducks and
shirts, broad belts, and deep visored baseball caps of yellow
straw. They were standing side by side, bracing themselves
against the slow swell. One of them was holding a long black
loud-hailer with a wire attached. The other was manning a
machine gun on a tripod. It looked to Bond like a Spandau.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man with the loud-hailer let it fall so that it swung on a
strap round his neck. He picked up a pair of binoculars and
began inching them along the beach. The low murmur of his
comments just reached Bond above the glutinous flutter of the
diesels.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond watched the eyes of the binoculars begin with the
headland and then sweep the sand. The twin eyes paused
among the rocks and moved on. They came back. The murmur
of comment rose to a jabber. The man handed the glasses to
the machine gunner who took a quick glance through them and
gave them back. The scanner shouted something to the helmsman.
The cabin cruiser stopped and backed up. Now she
lay outside the reef exactly opposite Bond and the girl. The
scanner again levelled the binoculars at the rocks where the
girl’s canoe lay hidden. Again the excited jabber came across
the water. Again the glasses were passed to the machine gunner
who glanced through. This time he nodded decisively.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond thought: now we’ve had it. These men know their job.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond watched the machine gunner pull the bolt back to
load. The double click came to him over the bubbling of the
diesels.</p>

<p class="pindent">The scanner lifted his loud-hailer and switched it on. The
twanging echo of the amplifier moaned and screeched across
the water. The man brought it up to his lips. The voice roared
across the bay.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Okay, folks! Come on out and you won’t get hurt.”</p>

<p class="pindent">It was an educated voice. There was a trace of American
accent.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Now then, folks,” the voice thundered, “make it quick!
We’ve seen where you came ashore. We’ve spotted the boat
under the driftwood. We ain’t fools an’ we ain’t fooling. Take
it easy. Just walk out with your hands up. You’ll be okay.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Silence fell. The waves lapped softly on the beach. Bond
could hear the girl breathing. The thin screeching of the cormorants
came to them muted across the mile of sea. The
diesels bubbled unevenly as the swell covered the exhaust pipe
and then opened it again.</p>

<p class="pindent">Softly Bond reached over to the girl and tugged at her sleeve.
“Come close,” he whispered. “Smaller target.” He felt her
warmth nearer to him. Her cheek brushed against his forearm.
He whispered, “Burrow into the sand. Wriggle. Every inch’ll
help.” He began to worm his body carefully deeper into the
depression they had scooped out for themselves. He felt her do
the same. He peered out. Now his eyes were only just above
the skyline of the top of the beach.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man was lifting his loud-hailer. The voice roared.
“Okay, folks! Just so as you’ll know this thing isn’t for show.”
He lifted his thumb. The machine gunner trained his gun into
the tops of the mangroves behind the beach. There came the
swift rattling roar Bond had last heard coming from the
German lines in the Ardennes. The bullets made the same old
sound of frightened pigeons whistling overhead. Then there
was silence.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the distance Bond watched the black cloud of cormorants
take to the air and begin circling. His eyes went back to the
boat. The machine gunner was feeling the barrel of his gun to
see if it had warmed. The two men exchanged some words.
The scanner picked up his loud-hailer.</p>

<p class="pindent">“ ’Kay, folks,” he said harshly. “You’ve been warned. This
is it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond watched the snout of the Spandau swing and depress.
The man was going to start with the canoe among the rocks.
Bond whispered to the girl, “All right, Honey. Stick it. Keep
right down. It won’t last long.” He felt her hand squeeze his
arm. He thought: poor little bitch, she’s in this because of me.
He leant to the right to cover her head and pushed his face
deep into the sand.</p>

<p class="pindent">This time the crash of noise was terrific. The bullets howled
into the corner of the headland. Fragments of splintered rock
whined over the beach like hornets. Ricochets twanged and
buzzed off into the hinterland. Behind it all there was the
steady road-drill hammer of the gun.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a pause. New magazine, thought Bond. Now it’s
us. He could feel the girl clutching at him. Her body was
trembling along his flank. Bond reached out an arm and pressed
her to him.</p>

<p class="pindent">The roar of the gun began again. The bullets came zipping
along the tideline towards them. There was a succession of
quick close thuds. The bush above them was being torn to
shreds. ‘Zwip. Zwip. Zwip.’ It was as if the thong of a steel
whip was cutting the bush to pieces. Bits scattered around
them, slowly covering them. Bond could smell the cooler air
that meant they were now lying in the open. Were they hidden
by the leaves and debris? The bullets marched away along the
shoreline. In less than a minute the racket stopped.</p>

<p class="pindent">The silence sang. The girl whimpered softly. Bond hushed
her and held her tighter.</p>

<p class="pindent">The loud-hailer boomed. “Okay, folks. If you still got ears,
we’ll be along soon to pick up the bits. And we’ll be bringing
the dogs. ’Bye for now.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The slow thud of the diesel quickened. The engine accelerated
into a hasty roar and through the fallen leaves Bond
watched the stern of the launch settle lower in the water as it
made off to the west. Within minutes it was out of earshot.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond cautiously raised his head. The bay was serene, the
beach unmarked. All was as before except for the stench of
cordite and the sour smell of blasted rock. Bond pulled the girl
to her feet. There were tear streaks down her face. She looked
at him aghast. She said solemnly, “That was horrible. What
did they do it for? We might have been killed.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond thought, this girl has always had to fend for herself,
but only against nature. She knows the world of animals and
insects and fishes and she’s got the better of it. But it’s been a
small world, bounded by the sun and the moon and the
seasons. She doesn’t know the big world of the smoke-filled
room, of the bullion broker’s parlour, of the corridors and
waiting-rooms of government offices, of careful meetings on
park seats—she doesn’t know about the struggle for big power
and big money by the big men. She doesn’t know that she’s
been swept out of her rock pool into the dirty waters.</p>

<p class="pindent">He said, “It’s all right, Honey. They’re just a lot of bad men
who are frightened of us. We can manage them.” Bond put his
arm round her shoulders, “And you were wonderful. As brave
as anything. Come on now, we’ll look for Quarrel and make
some plans. Anyway, it’s time we had something to eat. What
do you eat on these expeditions?”</p>

<p class="pindent">They turned and walked up the beach to the headland. After
a minute she said in a controlled voice, “Oh, there’s stacks of
food about. Sea urchins mostly. And there are wild bananas
and things. I eat and sleep for two days before I come out here.
I don’t need anything.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond held her more closely. He dropped his arm as Quarrel
appeared on the skyline. Quarrel scrambled down among the
rocks. He stopped, looking down. They came up with him.
The girl’s canoe was sawn almost in half by the bullets. The
girl gave a cry. She looked desperately at Bond, “My boat!
How am I to get back?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Don’t you worry, missy.” Quarrel appreciated the loss of a
canoe better than Bond. He guessed it might be most of the
girl’s capital. “Cap’n fix you up wit’ anudder. An’ yo come
back wit’ we. Us got a fine boat in de mangrove. Hit not get
broke. Ah’s bin to see him.” Quarrel looked at Bond. Now his
face was worried. “But cap’n, yo sees what I means about dese
folk. Dey mighty tough men an’ dey means business. Dese
dogs dey speak of. Dose is police-houns—Pinschers dey’s
called. Big bastards. Mah frens tell me as dere’s a pack of
twenty or moh. We better make plans quick—an’ good.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“All right, Quarrel. But first we must have something to eat.
And I’m damned if I’m going to be scared off the island before
I’ve had a good look. We’ll take Honey with us.” He turned to
the girl. “Is that all right with you, Honey? You’ll be all right
with us. Then we’ll sail home together.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl looked doubtfully at him. “I guess there’s no
alternative. I mean. I’d love to go with you if I won’t be in the
way. I really don’t want anything to eat. But will you take me
home as soon as you can? I don’t want to see any more of those
people. How long are you going to be looking at these birds?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said evasively, “Not long. I’ve got to find out what
happened to them and why. Then we’ll be off.” He looked at
his watch. “It’s twelve now. You wait here. Have a bathe or
something. Don’t walk about leaving footprints. Come on,
Quarrel, we’d better get that boat hidden.”</p>

<p class="pindent">It was one o’clock before they were ready. Bond and Quarrel
filled the canoe with stones and sand until it sank in a pool
among the mangroves. They smeared over their footprints.
The bullets had left so much litter behind the shoreline that
they could do most of their walking on broken leaves and
twigs. They ate some of their rations—avidly, the girl reluctantly—and
climbed across the rocks and into the shallow
water off-shore. Then they trudged along the shallows towards
the river mouth three hundred yards away down the beach.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was very hot. A harsh, baking wind had sprung up from
the north-east. Quarrel said this wind blew daily the year
round. It was vital to the guanera. It dried the guano. The glare
from the sea and from the shiny green leaves of the mangroves
was dazzling. Bond was glad he had taken trouble to get his
skin hardened to the sun.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a sandy bar at the river mouth and a long deep
stagnant pool. They could either get wet or strip. Bond said
to the girl, “Honey, we can’t be shy on this trip. We’ll keep
our shirts on because of the sun. Wear what’s sensible and
walk behind us.” Without waiting for her reply the two men
took off their trousers. Quarrel rolled them and packed them
in the knapsack with the provisions and Bond’s gun. They
waded into the pool, Quarrel in front, then Bond, then the
girl. The water came up to Bond’s waist. A big silver fish
leaped out of the pool and fell back with a splash. There were
arrows on the surface where others fled out of their way.
“Tarpon,” commented Quarrel.</p>

<p class="pindent">The pool converged into a narrow neck over which the
mangroves touched. For a time they waded through a cool
tunnel, and then the river broadened into a deep sluggish
channel that meandered ahead among the giant spider-legs of
the mangroves. The bottom was muddy and at each step their
feet sank inches into slime. Small fish or shrimps wriggled and
fled from under their feet, and every now and then they had to
stoop to brush away leeches before they got hold. But otherwise
it was easy going and quiet and cool among the bushes
and, at least to Bond, it was a blessing to be out of the sun.</p>

<p class="pindent">Soon, as they got away from the sea, it began to smell bad
with the bad egg, sulphuretted hydrogen smell of marsh gas.
The mosquitoes and sandflies began to find them. They liked
Bond’s fresh body. Quarrel told him to dip himself in the
river water. “Dem like dere meat wid salt on him,” he explained
cheerfully. Bond took off his shirt and did as he was
told. Then it was better and after a while Bond’s nostrils even
got used to the marsh gas, except when Quarrel’s feet disturbed
some aged pocket in the mud and a vintage bubble wobbled up
from the bottom and burst stinking under his nose.</p>

<p class="pindent">The mangroves became fewer and sparser and the river
slowly opened out. The water grew shallower and the bottom
firmer. Soon they came round a bend and into the open.
Honey said, “Better watch out now. We’ll be easier to see. It
goes on like this for about a mile. Then the river gets narrower
until the lake. Then there’s the sandspit the birdmen lived on.”</p>

<p class="pindent">They stopped in the shadow of the mangrove tunnel and
looked out. The river meandered sluggishly away from them
towards the centre of the island. Its banks, fringed with low
bamboo and sea-grape, would give only half shelter. From its
western bank the ground rose slowly and then sharply up to
the sugar-loaf about two miles away which was the guanera.
Round the base of the mountain there was a scattering of
Quonset huts. A zigzag of silver ran down the hillside to
the huts—a Decauville Track, Bond guessed, to bring the
guano from the diggings down to the crusher and separator.
The summit of the sugar-loaf was white, as if with snow. From
the peak flew a smoky flag of guano dust. Bond could see the
black dots of cormorants against the white background. They
were landing and taking off like bees at a hive.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stood and gazed at the distant glittering mountain
of bird dung. So this was the kingdom of Doctor No! Bond
thought he had never seen a more godforsaken landscape in his
life.</p>

<p class="pindent">He examined the ground between the river and the mountain.
It seemed to be the usual grey dead coral broken, where
there was a pocket of earth, by low scrub and screwpalm. No
doubt a road or a track led down the mountainside to the
central lake and the marshes. It looked bad stuff to cross unless
there was. Bond noticed that all the vegetation was bent to the
westwards. He imagined living the year round with that hot
wind constantly scouring the island, the smell of the marsh
gas and the guano. No penal colony could have a worse site
than this.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked to the east. There the mangroves in the marshland
seemed more hospitable. They marched away in a solid
green carpet until they lost their outline in the dancing heat
haze on the horizon. Over them a thick froth of birds tossed and
settled and tossed again. Their steady scream carried over on
the harsh wind.</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel’s voice broke in on Bond’s thoughts. “Dey’s a
comin’, cap’n.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond followed Quarrel’s eyes. A big lorry was racing down
from the huts, dust streaming from its wheels. Bond followed it
for ten minutes until it disappeared amongst the mangroves at
the head of the river. He listened. The baying of dogs came
down on the wind.</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel said, “Dey’ll come down de ribber, cap’n. Dem’ll
know we cain’t move ’cept up de ribber, assumin’ we ain’t
dead. Dey’ll surely come down de ribber to de beach and look
for de pieces. Den mos’ likely de boat come wit’ a dinghy an’
take de men and dogs off. Leastways, dat’s what Ah’d do in
dere place.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Honey said, “That’s what they do when they look for me.
It’s quite all right. You cut a piece of bamboo and when
they get near you go under the water and breathe through the
bamboo till they’ve gone by.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled at Quarrel. He said, “Supposing you get the
bamboo while I find a good mangrove clump.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel nodded dubiously. He started off upstream towards
the bamboo thickets. Bond turned back into the mangrove
tunnel.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had avoided looking at the girl. She said impatiently,
“You needn’t be so careful of looking at me. It’s no good
minding those things at a time like this. You said so yourself.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned and looked at her. Her tattered shirt came
down to the waterline. There was a glimpse of pale wavering
limbs below. The beautiful face smiled at him. In the mangroves
the broken nose seemed appropriate in its animalness.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked at her slowly. She understood. He turned and
went on downstream and she followed him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond found what he wanted, a crack in the wall of mangrove
that seemed to go deeper. He said, “Don’t break a branch.” He
bent his head and waded in. The channel went in ten yards.
The mud under their feet became deeper and softer. Then
there was a solid wall of roots and they could go no farther.
The brown water flowed slowly through a wide, quiet, pool.
Bond stopped. The girl came close to him. “This is real hide
and seek,” she said tremulously.</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, isn’t it.” Bond was thinking of his gun. He was
wondering how well it would shoot after a bath in the river—how
many dogs and men he could get if they were found. He
felt a wave of disquiet. It had been a bad break coming across
this girl. In combat, like it or not, a girl is your extra heart.
The enemy has two targets against your one.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond remembered his thirst. He scooped up some water.
It was brackish and tasted of earth. It was all right. He drank
some more. The girl put out her hand and stopped him. “Don’t
drink too much. Wash your mouth out and spit. You could
get fever.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked at her quietly. He did as she told him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel whistled from somewhere in the main stream.
Bond answered and waded out towards him. They came back
along the channel. Quarrel splashed the mangrove roots with
water where their bodies might have brushed against them.
“Kill da smell of us,” he explained briefly. He produced his
handful of bamboo lengths and began whittling and cutting
them. Bond looked to his gun and the spare ammunition.
They stood still in the pool so as not to stir up more mud.</p>

<p class="pindent">The sunlight dappled down through the thick roof of leaves.
The shrimps nibbled softly at their feet. Tension built up in
the hot, crouching silence.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was almost a relief to hear the baying of the dogs.</p>

<div class="lgl"><h1 class="nobreak" id="calibre_toc_10">X<br class="lgl"/> DRAGON SPOOR</h1></div>

<p class="noindent"><span class="dropcap">T</span><span class="sc">he search</span> party was coming fast down the river. The
two men in bathing trunks and tall waders were having to
run to keep up with the dogs. They were big Chinese Negroes
wearing shoulder holsters across their naked sweating chests.
Occasionally they exchanged shouts that were mostly swear-words.
Ahead of them the pack of big Dobermann Pinschers
swam and floundered through the water, baying excitedly.
They had a scent and they quested frenziedly, the diamond-shaped
ears erect on the smooth, serpentine heads.</p>

<p class="pindent">“May be a ——ing crocodile,” yelled the leading man through
the hubbub. He was carrying a short whip which he occasionally
cracked like a whipper-in on the hunting field.</p>

<p class="pindent">The other man converged towards him. He shouted
excitedly, “For my money it’s the ——ing limey! Bet ya he’s
lying up in the mangrove. Mind he doesn’t give us a ——ing
ambush.” The man took the gun out of its holster and put it
under his armpit and kept his hand on the butt.</p>

<p class="pindent">They were coming out of the open river into the mangrove
tunnel. The first man had a whistle. It stuck out of his broad
face like a cigar butt. He blew a shrill blast. When the dogs
swept on he laid about him with the whip. The dogs checked,
whimpering as the slow current forced them to disobey orders.
The two men took their guns and waded slowly downstream
through the straggly legs of the mangroves.</p>

<p class="pindent">The leading man came to the narrow break that Bond had
found. He grasped a dog by the collar and swung it into the
channel. The dog snorted eagerly and paddled forward. The
man’s eyes squinted at the mangrove roots on either side of the
channel to see if they were scratched.</p>

<p class="pindent">The dog and the man came into the small enclosed pool at
the end of the channel. The man looked round disgustedly. He
caught the dog by the collar and pulled him back. The dog
was reluctant to leave the place. The man lashed down into the
water with his whip.</p>

<p class="pindent">The second man had been waiting at the entrance to the
little channel. The first man came out. He shook his head and
they went on downstream, the dogs, now less excited, streaming
ahead.</p>

<p class="pindent">Slowly the noise of the hunt grew less and vanished.</p>

<p class="pindent">For another five minutes nothing moved in the mangrove
pool, then, in one corner among the roots, a thin periscope of
bamboo rose slowly out of the water. Bond’s face emerged, the
forehead streaked with wet hair, like the face of a surfacing
corpse. In his right hand under the water the gun was ready.
He listened intently. There was dead silence, not a sound. Or
was there? What was that soft swish out in the main stream?
Was someone wading very quietly along in the wake of the
hunt? Bond reached out on either side of him and softly
touched the other two bodies that lay among the roots on the
edge of the pool. As the two faces surfaced he put his finger
to his lips. It was too late. Quarrel had coughed and spat.
Bond made a grimace and nodded urgently towards the main
stream. They all listened. There was dead silence. Then the
soft swishing began again. Whoever it was was coming into the
side-channel. The tubes of bamboo went back into the three
mouths and the heads softly submerged again.</p>

<p class="pindent">Underwater, Bond rested his head in the mud, pinched his
nostrils with his left hand and pursed his lips round the tube.
He knew the pool had been examined once already. He had
felt the disturbance of the swimming dog. That time they had
not been found. Would they get away with it again? This time
there would have been less chance for the stirred mud to seep
away out of the pool. If this searcher saw the darker brown
stain, would he shoot into it or stab into it? What weapons
would he have? Bond decided that he wouldn’t take chances.
At the first movement in the water near him he would get to
his feet and shoot and hope for the best.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond lay and focused all his senses. What hell this controlled
breathing was and how maddening the soft nibbling of the
shrimps! It was lucky none of them had a sore on their bodies
or the damned things would have eaten into it. But it had been
a bright idea of the girl’s. Without it the dogs would have got
to them wherever they had hidden.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly Bond cringed. A rubber boot had stepped on his
shin and slid off. Would the man think it was a branch? Bond
couldn’t chance it. With one surge of motion he hurled himself
upwards, spitting out the length of bamboo.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond caught a quick impression of a huge body standing
almost on top of him and of a swirling rifle butt. He lifted his
left arm to protect his head and felt the jarring blow on his
forearm. At the same time his right hand lunged forward and
as the muzzle of his gun touched the glistening right breast
below the hairless aureole he pulled the trigger.</p>

<p class="pindent">The kick of the explosion, pent up against the man’s body,
almost broke Bond’s wrist, but the man crashed back like a
chopped tree into the water. Bond caught a glimpse of a huge
rent in his side as he went under. The rubber waders thrashed
once and the head, a Chinese Negroid head, broke the surface,
its eyes turned up and water pouring from its silently yelling
mouth. Then the head went under again and there was nothing
but muddy froth and a slowly widening red stain that began to
seep away downstream.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shook himself. He turned. Quarrel and the girl were
standing behind him, water streaming from their bodies.
Quarrel was grinning from ear to ear, but the girl’s knuckles
were at her mouth and her eyes were staring horror-struck at
the reddened water.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said curtly, “I’m sorry, Honey. It had to be done. He
was right on top of us. Come on, let’s get going.” He took
her roughly by the arm and thrust her away from the place
and out into the main stream, only stopping when they had
reached the open river at the beginning of the mangrove
tunnel.</p>

<p class="pindent">The landscape was empty again. Bond glanced at his watch.
It had stopped at three o’clock. He looked at the westering sun.
It might be four o’clock now. How much farther had they to
go? Bond suddenly felt tired. Now he’d torn it. Even if the
shot hadn’t been heard—and it would have been well muffled
by the man’s body and by the mangroves—the man would be
missed when the others rendezvoused, if Quarrel’s guess was
right, at the river mouth to be taken off to the launch. Would
they come back up the river to look for the missing man?
Probably not. It would be getting dark before they knew for
certain that he was missing. They’d send out a search party in
the morning. The dogs would soon get the body. Then what?</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl tugged at his sleeve. She said angrily, “It’s time
you told me what all this is about! Why’s everybody trying to
kill each other? And who are you? I don’t believe all this story
about birds. You don’t take a revolver after birds.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked down into the angry, wide-apart eyes. “I’m
sorry, Honey. I’m afraid I’ve got you into a bit of a mess. I’ll
tell you all about it this evening when we get to the camp. It’s
just bad luck you being mixed up with me like this. I’ve got a
bit of a war on with these people. They seem to want to kill
me. Now I’m only interested in seeing us all off the island
without anyone else getting hurt. I’ve got enough to go on
now so that next time I can come back by the front door.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“What do you mean? Are you some sort of a policeman? Are
you trying to send this Chinaman to prison?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That’s about it,” Bond smiled down at her. “At least
you’re on the side of the angels. And now you tell me something.
How much farther to the camp?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh, about an hour.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Is it a good place to hide? Could they find us there easily?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“They’d have to come across the lake or up the river. It’ll
be all right so long as they don’t send their dragon after us. He
can go through the water. I’ve seen him do it.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh well,” said Bond diplomatically, “let’s hope he’s got a
sore tail or something.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl snorted. “All right, Mr Know-all,” she said
angrily. “Just you wait.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel splashed out of the mangroves. He was carrying a
rifle. He said apologetically. “No harm’n havin’ anudder gun,
cap’n. Looks like us may need hit.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took it. It was a U.S. Army Remington Carbine, .300.
These people certainly had the right equipment. He handed it
back.</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel echoed his thoughts. “Dese is sly folks, cap’n. Dat
man mus’ of come sneakin’ down soffly behind de udders to
ketch us comin’ out after de dawgs had passed. He sho is a
sly mongoose, dat Doctor feller.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said thoughtfully, “He must be quite a man.” He
shrugged away his thoughts. “Now let’s get going. Honey says
there’s another hour to the camp. Better keep to the left bank
so as to get what cover we can from the hill. For all we know
they’ve got glasses trained on the river.” Bond handed his gun
to Quarrel who stowed it in the sodden knapsack. They moved
off again with Quarrel in the lead and Bond and the girl walking
together.</p>

<p class="pindent">They got some shade from the bamboo and bushes along
the western bank, but now they had to face the full force of the
scorching wind. They splashed water over their arms and faces
to cool the burns. Bond’s eyes were bloodshot with the glare
and his arm ached intolerably where the gun butt had struck.
And he was not looking forward to his dinner of soaking bread
and cheese and salt pork. How long would they be able to
sleep? He hadn’t had much last night. It looked like the same
ration again. And what about the girl? She had had none. He
and Quarrel would have to keep watch and watch. And then
tomorrow. Off into the mangrove again and work their way
slowly back to the canoe across the eastern end of the island.
It looked like that. And sail the following night. Bond thought
of hacking a way for five miles through solid mangroves. What
a prospect! Bond trudged on, thinking of M’s ‘holiday in the
sunshine’. He’d certainly give something for M to be sharing
it with him now.</p>

<p class="pindent">The river grew narrower until it was only a stream between
the bamboo clumps. Then it widened out into a flat marshy
estuary beyond which the five square miles of shallow lake
swept away to the other side of the island in a ruffled blue-grey
mirror. Beyond, there was the shimmer of the airstrip
and the glint of the sun on a single hangar. The girl told them
to keep to the east and they worked their way slowly along
inside the fringe of bushes.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly Quarrel stopped, his face pointing like a gun-dog’s
at the marshy ground in front of him. Two deep parallel
grooves were cut into the mud, with a fainter groove in the
centre. They were the tracks of something that had come down
from the hill and gone across the marsh towards the lake.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl said indifferently. “That’s where the dragon’s
been.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel turned the whites of his eyes towards her.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked slowly along the tracks. The outside ones were
quite smooth with an indented curve. They could have been
made by wheels, but they were vast—at least two feet across.
The centre track was of the same shape but only three inches
across, about the width of a motor tyre. The tracks were
without a trace of tread, and they were fairly fresh. They
marched along in a dead straight line and the bushes they
crossed were squashed flat as if a tank had gone over them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond couldn’t imagine what kind of vehicle, if it was a
vehicle, had made them. When the girl nudged him and
whispered fiercely “I told you so”, he could only say thoughtfully,
“Well, Honey, if it isn’t a dragon, it’s something else I’ve
never seen before.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Farther on, she tugged urgently at his sleeve. “Look,” she
whispered. She pointed forward to a big clump of bushes
beside which the tracks ran. They were leafless and blackened.
In the centre there showed the charred remains of birds’ nests.
“He breathed on them,” she said excitedly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked up to the bushes and examined them. “He
certainly did,” he admitted. Why had this particular clump
been burned? It was all very odd.</p>

<p class="pindent">The tracks swerved out towards the lake and disappeared
into the water. Bond would have liked to follow them but there
was no question of leaving cover. They trudged on, wrapped
in their different thoughts.</p>

<p class="pindent">Slowly the day began to die behind the sugar-loaf, and at
last the girl pointed ahead through the bushes and Bond could
see a long spit of sand running out into the lake. There were
thick bushes of sea-grape along its spine and, halfway, perhaps
a hundred yards from the shore, the remains of a thatched hut.
It looked a reasonably attractive place to spend the night and it
was well protected by the water on both sides. The wind had
died and the water was soft and inviting. How heavenly it was
going to be to take off their filthy shirts and wash in the lake,
and, after the hours of squelching through the mud and stench
of the river and the marsh, be able to lie down on the hard dry
sand!</p>

<p class="pindent">The sun blazed yellowly and sank behind the mountain. The
day was still alive at the eastern tip of the island, but the black
shadow of the sugar-loaf was slowly marching across the lake
and would soon reach out and kill that too. The frogs started
up, louder than in Jamaica, until the thick dusk was shrill with
them. Across the lake a giant bull frog began to drum. The
eerie sound was something between a tom-tom and an ape’s
roar. It sent out short messages that were suddenly throttled.
Soon it fell silent. It had found what it had sent for.</p>

<p class="pindent">They reached the neck of the sandspit and filed out along a
narrow track. They came to the clearing with the smashed
remains of the wattle hut. The big mysterious tracks led out of
the water on both sides and through the clearing and over the
nearby bushes as if the thing, whatever it was, had stampeded
the place. Many of the bushes were burned or charred. There
were the remains of a fireplace made of lumps of coral and a
few scattered cooking pots and empty tins. They searched in
the debris and Quarrel unearthed a couple of unopened tins of
Heinz pork and beans. The girl found a crumpled sleeping-bag.
Bond found a small leather purse containing five one-dollar
notes, three Jamaica pounds and some silver. The two
men had certainly left in a hurry.</p>

<p class="pindent">They left the place and moved farther along to a small sandy
clearing. Through the bushes they could see lights winking
across the water from the mountain, perhaps two miles away.
To the eastward there was nothing but the soft black sheen of
water under the darkening sky.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “As long as we don’t show a light we should be
fine here. The first thing is to have a good wash. Honey, you
take the rest of the sandspit and we’ll have the landward end.
See you for dinner in about half an hour.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl laughed. “Will you be dressing?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Certainly,” said Bond. “Trousers.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Quarrel said, “Cap’n, while dere’s henough light I’ll get
dese tins open and get tings fixed for de night.” He rummaged
in the knapsack. “Here’s yo trousers and yo gun. De bread
don’t feel so good but hit only wet. Hit eat okay an’ mebbe hit
dry hout come de mornin’. Guess we’d better eat de tins
tonight an’ keep de cheese an’ pork. Dose tins is heavy an’ we
got plenty footin’ tomorrow.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “All right, Quarrel. I’ll leave the menu to you.”
He took the gun and the damp trousers and walked down into
the shallow water and back the way they had come. He found
a hard dry stretch of sand and took off his shirt and stepped
back into the water and lay down. The water was soft but
disgustingly warm. He dug up handfuls of sand and scrubbed
himself with it, using it as soap. Then he lay and luxuriated
in the silence and the loneliness.</p>

<p class="pindent">The stars began to shine palely, the stars that had brought
them to the island last night, a year ago, the stars that would
take them away again tomorrow night, a year away. What a
trip! But at least it had already paid off. Now he had enough
evidence, and witnesses, to go back to the Governor and get a
full-dress inquiry going into the activities of Doctor No. One
didn’t use machine guns on people, even on trespassers. And,
by the same token, what was this thing of Doctor No’s that had
trespassed on the leasehold of the Audubon Society, the thing
that had smashed their property and had possibly killed one
of their wardens? That would have to be investigated too.
And what would he find when he came back to the island
through the front door, in a destroyer, perhaps, and with a
detachment of marines? What would be the answer to the
riddle of Doctor No? What was he hiding? What did he fear?
Why was privacy so important to him that he would murder,
again and again, for it? Who <span class="it">was</span> Doctor No?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond heard splashing away to his right. He thought of the
girl. And who, for the matter of that, was Honeychile Rider?
That, he decided, as he climbed out on to dry land, was at
least something that he ought to be able to find out before the
night was over.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond pulled on his clammy trousers and sat down on the
sand and dismantled his gun. He did it by touch, using his
shirt to dry each part and each cartridge. Then he reassembled
the gun and clicked the trigger round the empty cylinder. The
sound was healthy. It would be days before it rusted. He
loaded it and tucked it into the holster inside the waistband
of his trousers and got up and walked back to the clearing.</p>

<p class="pindent">The shadow of Honey reached up and pulled him down
beside her. “Come on,” she said, “we’re starving. I got one
of the cooking pots and cleaned it out and we poured the beans
into it. There’s about two full handfuls each and a cricket ball
of bread. And I’m not feeling guilty about eating your food
because you made me work far harder than I would if I’d
been alone. Here, hold out your hand.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled at the authority in her voice. He could just
make out her silhouette in the dusk. Her head looked sleeker.
He wondered what her hair looked like when it was combed
and dry. What would she be like when she was wearing clean
clothes over that beautiful golden body? He could see her
coming into a room or across the lawn at Beau Desert. She
would be a beautiful, ravishing, Ugly Duckling. Why had she
never had the broken nose mended? It was an easy operation.
Then she would be the most beautiful girl in Jamaica.</p>

<p class="pindent">Her shoulder brushed against him. Bond reached out and
put his hand down in her lap, open. She picked up his hand
and Bond felt the cold mess of beans being poured into it.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly he smelled her warm animal smell. It was so
sensually thrilling that his body swayed against her and for a
moment his eyes closed.</p>

<p class="pindent">She gave a short laugh in which there was shyness and
satisfaction and tenderness. She said “There,” maternally, and
carried his laden hand away from her and back to him.</p>
