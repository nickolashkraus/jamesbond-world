<p class="pindent">It was twelve o’clock when Bond left the Splendide and
the clock on the <span class="it">mairie</span> was stumbling through its midday
carillon. There was a strong scent of pine and mimosa
in the air and the freshly watered gardens of the Casino
opposite, interspersed with neat gravel parterres and paths,
lent the scene a pretty formalism more appropriate to ballet
than to melodrama.</p>

<p class="pindent">The sun shone and there was a gaiety and sparkle in the
air which seemed to promise well for the new era of fashion
and prosperity for which the little seaside town, after many
vicissitudes, was making its gallant bid.</p>

<p class="pindent">Royale-les-Eaux, which lies near the mouth of the
Somme before the flat coast-line soars up from the beaches
of southern Picardy to the Brittany cliffs which run on to
Le Havre, had experienced much the same fortunes as
Trouville.</p>

<p class="pindent">Royale (without the ‘Eaux’) also started as a small
fishing village and its rise to fame as a fashionable watering-place
during the Second Empire was as meteoric as that of
Trouville. But as Deauville killed Trouville, so, after
a long period of decline, did Le Touquet kill Royale.</p>

<p class="pindent">At the turn of the century, when things were going
badly for the little seaside town and when the fashion was
to combine pleasure with a ‘cure’, a natural spring in the
hills behind Royale was discovered to contain enough
diluted sulphur to have a beneficent effect on the liver.
Since all French people suffer from liver complaints, Royale
quickly became ‘Royale-les-Eaux’, and ‘Eau Royale’, in
a torpedo-shaped bottle, grafted itself demurely on to the
tail of the mineral-water lists in hotels and restaurant cars.</p>

<p class="pindent">It did not long withstand the powerful combines of
Vichy and Perrier and Vittel. There came a series of lawsuits,
a number of people lost a lot of money and very soon
its sale was again entirely local. Royale fell back on the
takings from the French and English families during the
summer, on its fishing-fleet in winter and on the crumbs
which fell to its elegantly dilapidated Casino from the table
at Le Touquet.</p>

<p class="pindent">But there was something splendid about the Negresco
baroque of the Casino Royale, a strong whiff of Victorian
elegance and luxury, and in 1950 Royale caught the fancy
of a syndicate in Paris which disposed of large funds belonging
to a group of expatriate Vichyites.</p>

<p class="pindent">Brighton had been revived since the war, and Nice.
Nostalgia for more spacious, golden times might be a source
of revenue.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Casino was repainted in its original white and gilt
and the rooms decorated in the palest grey with wine-red
carpets and curtains. Vast Chandeliers were suspended from
the ceilings. The gardens were spruced and the fountains
played again and the two main hotels, the Splendide and
the Hermitage, were prinked and furbished and restaffed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Even the small town and the <span class="it">vieux-port</span> managed to fix
welcoming smiles across their ravaged faces, and the main
street became gay with the <span class="it">vitrines</span> of great Paris jewellers
and couturiers, tempted down for a butterfly season by
rent-free sites and lavish promises.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then the Mahomet Ali Syndicate was cajoled into starting
a high game in the Casino and the Société des Bains de
Mer de Royale felt that now at last Le Touquet would have
to yield up some of the treasure stolen over the years from
its parent <span class="it">plage</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">Against the background of this luminous and sparkling
stage Bond stood in the sunshine and felt his mission to be
incongruous and remote and his dark profession an affront
to his fellow actors.</p>

<p class="pindent">He shrugged away the momentary feeling of unease and
walked round the back of his hotel and down the ramp to
the garage. Before his rendezvous at the Hermitage he
decided to take his car down the coast road and have a
quick look at Le Chiffre’s villa and then drive back by the
inland road until it crossed the <span class="it">route nationale</span> to Paris.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s car was his only personal hobby. One of the last
of the 4½-litre Bentleys with the supercharger by Amherst
Villiers, he had bought it almost new in 1933 and had kept
it in careful storage through the war. It was still serviced
every year and, in London, a former Bentley mechanic,
who worked in a garage near Bond’s Chelsea flat, tended it
with jealous care. Bond drove it hard and well and with an
almost sensual pleasure. It was a battleship-grey convertible
coupé, which really did convert, and it was capable of
touring at ninety with thirty miles an hour in reserve.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond eased the car out of the garage and up the ramp
and soon the loitering drum-beat of the two-inch exhaust
was echoing down the tree-lined boulevard, through the
crowded main street of the little town, and off through the
sand dunes to the south.</p>

<p class="pindent">An hour later, Bond walked into the Hermitage bar and
chose a table near one of the broad windows.</p>

<p class="pindent">The room was sumptuous with those over-masculine
trappings which, together with briar pipes and wire-haired
terriers, spell luxury in France. Everything was brass-studded
leather and polished mahogany. The curtains and
carpets were in royal blue. The waiters wore striped waistcoats
and green baize aprons. Bond ordered an Americano
and examined the sprinkling of over-dressed customers,
mostly from Paris he guessed, who sat talking with focus
and vivacity, creating that theatrically clubbable atmosphere
of <span class="it">l’heure de l’apéritif</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">The men were drinking inexhaustible quarter-bottles of
champagne, the women dry martinis.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Moi, j’adore le “Dry”</span>,’ a bright-faced girl at the next
table said to her companion, too neat in his unseasonable
tweeds, who gazed at her with moist brown eyes over the
top of an expensive shooting-stick from Hermes, ‘<span class="it">fait avec
du Gordon’s, bien entendu</span>.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">D’accord, Daisy. Mais tu sais, un zeste de citron . . .</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s eye was caught by the tall figure of Mathis on the
pavement outside, his face turned in animation to a dark-haired
girl in grey. His arm was linked in hers, high up
above the elbow, and yet there was a lack of intimacy in
their appearance, an ironical chill in the girl’s profile, which
made them seem two separate people rather than a couple.
Bond waited for them to come through the street door
into the bar, but for appearances’ sake continued to stare
out of the window at the passers-by.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But surely it is Monsieur Bond?’ Mathis’s voice behind
him was full of surprised delight. Bond, appropriately
flustered, rose to his feet. ‘Can it be that you are alone?
Are you awaiting someone? May I present my colleague,
Mademoiselle Lynd? My dear, this is the gentleman from
Jamaica with whom I had the pleasure of doing business
this morning.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond inclined himself with a reserved friendliness. ‘It
would be a great pleasure,’ he addressed himself to the girl.
‘I am alone. Would you both care to join me?’ He pulled
out a chair and while they sat down he beckoned to a waiter
and despite Mathis’s expostulations insisted on ordering
the drinks—a <span class="it">fine à l’eau</span> for Mathis and a <span class="it">bacardi</span> for the
girl.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis and Bond exchanged cheerful talk about the fine
weather and the prospects of a revival in the fortunes of
Royale-les-Eaux. The girl sat silent. She accepted one of
Bond’s cigarettes, examined it and then smoked it appreciatively
and without affectation, drawing the smoke deeply
into her lungs with a little sigh and then exhaling it casually
through her lips and nostrils. Her movements were economical
and precise with no trace of self-consciousness.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond felt her presence strongly. While he and Mathis
talked, he turned from time to time towards her, politely
including her in the conversation, but adding up the impressions
recorded by each glance.</p>

<p class="pindent">Her hair was very black and she wore it cut square and
low on the nape of the neck, framing her face to below the
clear and beautiful line of her jaw. Although it was heavy
and moved with the movements of her head, she did not
constantly pat it back into place, but let it alone. Her eyes
were wide apart and deep blue and they gazed candidly
back at Bond with a touch of ironical disinterest which, to
his annoyance, he found he would like to shatter, roughly.
Her skin was lightly sun-tanned and bore no trace of make-up
except on her mouth which was wide and sensual. Her
bare arms and hands had a quality of repose and the general
impression of restraint in her appearance and movements
was carried even to her fingernails which were unpainted
and cut short. Round her neck she wore a plain gold chain
of wide flat links and on the fourth finger of the right hand
a broad topaz ring. Her medium-length dress was of grey
<span class="it">soie sauvage</span> with a square-cut bodice, lasciviously tight
across her fine breasts. The skirt was closely pleated and
flowered down from a narrow, but not a thin, waist. She
wore a three-inch, handstitched black belt. A handstitched
black <span class="it">sabretache</span> rested on the chair beside her, together with
a wide cart-wheel hat of gold straw, its crown encircled by
a thin black velvet ribbon which tied at the back in a short
bow. Her shoes were square-toed of plain black leather.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was excited by her beauty and intrigued by her
composure. The prospect of working with her stimulated
him. At the same time he felt a vague disquiet. On an
impulse he touched wood.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis had noticed Bond’s preoccupation. After a time
he rose.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Forgive me,’ he said to the girl, ‘while I telephone to
the Dubernes. I must arrange my rendezvous for dinner
tonight. Are you sure you won’t mind being left to your
own devices this evening?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She shook her head.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took the cue and, as Mathis crossed the room to the
telephone booth beside the bar, he said: ‘If you are going to
be alone tonight, would you care to have dinner with me?’</p>

<p class="pindent">She smiled with the first hint of conspiracy she had
shown. ‘I would like to very much,’ she said, ‘and then
perhaps you would chaperon me to the Casino where
Monsieur Mathis tells me you are very much at home.
Perhaps I will bring you luck.’</p>

<p class="pindent">With Mathis gone, her attitude towards him showed a
sudden warmth. She seemed to acknowledge that they
were a team and, as they discussed the time and place of
their meeting, Bond realized that it would be quite easy
after all to plan the details of his project with her. He felt
that after all she was interested and excited by her role and
that she would work willingly with him. He had imagined
many hurdles before establishing a rapport, but now he
felt he could get straight down to professional details. He
was quite honest to himself about the hypocrisy of his attitude
towards her. As a woman, he wanted to sleep with
her but only when the job had been done.</p>

<p class="pindent">When Mathis came back to the table Bond called for his
bill. He explained that he was expected back at his hotel
to have lunch with friends. When for a moment he held
her hand in his he felt a warmth of affection and understanding
pass between them that would have seemed
impossible half an hour earlier.</p>

<p class="pindent">The girl’s eyes followed him out on to the boulevard.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis moved his chair close to hers and said softly:
‘That is a very good friend of mine. I am glad you have met
each other. I can already feel the ice-floes on the two rivers
breaking up.’ He smiled, ‘I don’t think Bond has ever been
melted. It will be a new experience for him. And for you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She did not answer him directly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He is very good-looking. He reminds me rather of
Hoagy Carmichael, but there is something cold and ruthless
in his . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">The sentence was never finished. Suddenly a few feet
away the entire plate-glass window shivered into confetti.
The blast of a terrific explosion, very near, hit them so that
they were rocked back in their chairs. There was an instant
of silence. Some objects pattered down on to the pavement
outside. Bottles slowly toppled off the shelves behind the
bar. Then there were screams and a stampede for the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Stay there,’ said Mathis.</p>

<p class="pindent">He kicked back his chair and hurtled through the empty
window-frame on to the pavement.</p>
