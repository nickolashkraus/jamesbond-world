<p class="pindent">The next two days were much the same.</p>

<p class="pindent">On the fourth day of their stay Vesper went off early
to Royale. A taxi came and fetched her and brought her
back. She said she needed some medicine.</p>

<p class="pindent">That night she made a special effort to be gay. She
drank a lot and when they went upstairs, she led him into
her bedroom and made passionate love to him. Bond’s
body responded, but afterwards she cried bitterly into her
pillow and Bond went to his room in grim despair.</p>

<p class="pindent">He could hardly sleep and in the early hours he heard her
door open softly. Some small sounds came from downstairs.
He was sure she was in the telephone booth. Very
soon he heard her door softly close and he guessed that
again there had been no reply from Paris.</p>

<p class="pindent">This was Saturday.</p>

<p class="pindent">On Sunday the man with the black patch was back again.
Bond knew it directly he looked up from his lunch and saw
her face. He had told her all that the <span class="it">patron</span> had told him,
withholding only the man’s statement that he might be
back. He had thought it would worry her.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had also telephoned Mathis in Paris and checked on
the Peugeot. It had been hired from a respectable firm
two weeks before. The customer had had a Swiss triptyque.
His name was Adolph Gettler. He had given a bank in
Zurich as his address.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis had got on to the Swiss police. Yes, the bank had
an account in this name. It was little used. Herr Gettler
was understood to be connected with the watch industry.
Inquiries could be pursued if there was a charge against
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Vesper had shrugged her shoulders at the information.
This time when the man appeared she left her lunch in
the middle and went straight up to her room.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond made up his mind. When he had finished, he
followed her. Both her doors were locked and when he
made her let him in, he saw that she had been sitting in
the shadows by the window, watching, he presumed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Her face was of cold stone. He led her to the bed and
drew her down beside him. They sat stiffly, like people in
a railway carriage.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Vesper,’ he said, holding her cold hands in his, ‘we
can’t go on like this. We must finish with it. We are torturing
each other and there is only one way of stopping
it. Either you must tell me what all this is about or we
must leave. At once.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She said nothing and her hands were lifeless in his.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My darling,’ he said. ‘Won’t you tell me? Do you
know, that first morning I was coming back to ask you
to marry me. Can’t we go back to the beginning
again? What is this dreadful nightmare that is killing
us?’</p>

<p class="pindent">At first she said nothing, then a tear rolled slowly down
her cheek.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You mean you would have married me?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond nodded.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh my God,’ she said. ‘My God.’ She turned and
clutched him, pressing her face against his chest.</p>

<p class="pindent">He held her closely to him. ‘Tell me, my love,’ he said.
‘Tell me what’s hurting you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Her sobs became quieter.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Leave me for a little,’ she said and a new note had come
into her voice. A note of resignation. ‘Let me think for a
little.’ She kissed his face and held it between her hands.
She looked at him with yearning. ‘Darling, I’m trying to
do what’s best for us. Please believe me. But it’s terrible.
I’m in a frightful . . .’ She wept again, clutching him like
a child with nightmares.</p>

<p class="pindent">He soothed her, stroking the long black hair and kissing
her softly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Go away now,’ she said. ‘I must have time to think.
We’ve got to do something.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She took his handkerchief and dried her eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">She led him to the door and there they held tightly to
each other. Then he kissed her again and she shut the
door behind him.</p>

<p class="pindent">That evening most of the gayness and intimacy of their
first night came back. She was excited and some of her
laughter sounded brittle, but Bond was determined to fall
in with her new mood and it was only at the end of dinner
that he made a passing remark which made her pause.</p>

<p class="pindent">She put her hand over his.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Don’t talk about it now,’ she said. ‘Forget it now.
It’s all past. I’ll tell you about it in the morning.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked at him and suddenly her eyes were full of
tears. She found a handkerchief in her bag and dabbed at
them.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Give me some more champagne,’ she said. She gave a
queer little laugh. ‘I want a lot more. You drink much
more than me. It’s not fair.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They sat and drank together until the bottle was finished.
Then she got to her feet. She knocked against her chair
and giggled.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I do believe I’m tight,’ she said, ‘how disgraceful.
Please, James, don’t be ashamed of me. I did so want to
be gay. And I am gay.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She stood behind him and ran her fingers through his
black hair.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Come up quickly,’ she said. ‘I want you badly tonight.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She blew a kiss at him and was gone.</p>

<p class="pindent">For two hours they made slow, sweet love in a mood of
happy passion which the day before Bond would never have
thought they could regain. The barriers of self-consciousness
and mistrust seemed to have vanished and the words
they spoke to each other were innocent and true again and
there was no shadow between them.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You must go now,’ said Vesper when Bond had slept
for a while in her arms.</p>

<p class="pindent">As if to take back her words she held him more closely to
her, murmuring endearments and pressing her body down
the whole length of his.</p>

<p class="pindent">When he finally rose and bent to smooth back her hair
and finally kiss her eyes and her mouth good night, she
reached out and turned on the light.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Look at me,’ she said, ‘and let me look at you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He knelt beside her.</p>

<p class="pindent">She examined every line on his face as if she was seeing
him for the first time. Then she reached up and put an
arm round his neck. Her deep blue eyes were swimming
with tears as she drew his head slowly towards her and
kissed him gently on the lips. Then she let him go and
turned off the light.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good night, my dearest love,’ she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond bent and kissed her. He tasted the tears on her
cheek.</p>

<p class="pindent">He went to the door and looked back.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sleep well, my darling,’ he said. ‘Don’t worry, everything’s
all right now.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He closed the door softly and walked to his room with a
full heart.</p>
