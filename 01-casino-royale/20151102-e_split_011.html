<p class="pindent">Bond looked round, but there was no possibility of
being overheard, and the caviar would be waiting for
the hot toast from the kitchens.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Tell me.’ His eyes glittered with interest.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘They got the third Bulgar, on the road to Paris. He was
in a Citroën and he had picked up two English hikers as
protective colouring. At the road-block his French was so
bad that they asked for his papers and he brought out a gun
and shot one of the motor-cycle patrol. But the other man
got him, I don’t know how, and managed to stop him
committing suicide. Then they took him down to Rouen
and extracted the story—in the usual French fashion, I
suppose.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Apparently they were part of a pool held in France for
this sort of job—saboteurs, thugs, and so on—and Mathis’s
friends are already trying to round up the rest. They were
to get two million francs for killing you and the agent who
briefed them told them there was absolutely no chance of
being caught if they followed his instructions exactly.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She took a sip of vodka. ‘But this is the interesting part.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The agent gave them the two camera-cases you saw.
He said the bright colours would make it easier for them.
He told them that the blue case contained a very powerful
smoke-bomb. The red case was the explosive. As one of
them threw the red case, the other was to press a switch on
the blue case and they would escape under cover of the
smoke. In fact, the smoke-bomb was a pure invention to
make the Bulgars think they could get away. Both cases
contained an identical high-explosive bomb. There was
no difference between the blue and the red cases. The
idea was to destroy you and the bomb-throwers without
trace. Presumably there were other plans for dealing with
the third man.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Go on,’ said Bond, full of admiration for the ingenuity
of the double-cross.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, apparently the Bulgars thought this sounded very
fine, but cannily they decided to take no chances. It would
be better, they thought, to touch off the smoke-bomb first
and, from inside the cloud of smoke, hurl the explosive
bomb at you. What you saw was the assistant bomb-thrower
pressing down the lever on the phoney smoke-bomb
and, of course, they both went up together.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The third Bulgar was waiting behind the Splendide to
pick his two friends up. When he saw what had happened,
he assumed they had bungled. But the police picked up
some fragments of the unexploded red bomb and he was
confronted with them. When he saw that they had been
tricked and that his two friends were meant to be murdered
with you, he started to talk. I expect he’s still talking now.
But there’s nothing to link all this with Le Chiffre. They
were given the job by some intermediary, perhaps one of
Le Chiffre’s guards, and Le Chiffre’s name means absolutely
nothing to the one who survived.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She finished her story just as the waiters arrived with the
caviar, a mound of hot toast, and small dishes containing
finely chopped onion and grated hard-boiled egg, the white
in one dish and the yolk in another.</p>

<p class="pindent">The caviar was heaped on to their plates and they ate for
a time in silence.</p>

<p class="pindent">After a while Bond said: ‘It’s very satisfactory to be a
corpse who changes places with his murderers. For them
it certainly was a case of being hoist with their own petard.
Mathis must be very pleased with the day’s work—five of
the opposition neutralized in twenty-four hours,’ and he
told her how the Muntzes had been confounded.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Incidentally,’ he asked, ‘how did you come to get
mixed up in this affair? What section are you in?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m personal assistant to Head of S,’ said Vesper. ‘As
it was his plan, he wanted his section to have a hand in the
operation and he asked M if I could go. It seemed only
to be a liaison job, so M said yes although he told my chief
that you would be furious at being given a woman to work
with.’ She paused and when Bond said nothing continued:
‘I had to meet Mathis in Paris and come down with him.
I’ve got a friend who is a <span class="it">vendeuse</span> with Dior and somehow
she managed to borrow me this and the frock I was wearing
this morning, otherwise I couldn’t possibly have competed
with all these people.’ She made a gesture towards the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The office was very jealous although they didn’t know
what the job was. All they knew was that I was to work
with a Double O. Of course you’re our heroes. I was
enchanted.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond frowned. ‘It’s not difficult to get a Double O
number if you’re prepared to kill people,’ he said. ‘That’s
all the meaning it has. It’s nothing to be particularly proud
of. I’ve got the corpses of a Japanese cipher expert in New
York and a Norwegian double agent in Stockholm to
thank for being a Double O. Probably quite decent people.
They just got caught up in the gale of the world like that
Yugoslav that Tito bumped off. It’s a confusing business
but if it’s one’s profession, one does what one’s told. How
do you like the grated egg with your caviar?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s a wonderful combination,’ she said. ‘I’m loving
my dinner. It seems a shame . . .’ She stopped, warned by a
cold look in Bond’s eye.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If it wasn’t for the job, we wouldn’t be here,’ he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly he regretted the intimacy of their dinner and of
their talk. He felt he had said too much and that what was
only a working relationship had become confused.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Let’s consider what has to be done,’ he said in a matter-of-fact
voice. ‘I’d better explain what I’m going to try and
do and how you can help. Which isn’t very much I’m
afraid,’ he added.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now these are the basic facts.’ He proceeded to sketch
out the plan and enumerate the various contingencies
which faced them.</p>

<p class="pindent">The <span class="it">maître d’hôtel</span> supervised the serving of the second
course and then as they ate the delicious food, Bond continued.</p>

<p class="pindent">She listened to him coldly, but with attentive obedience.
She felt thoroughly deflated by his harshness, while admitting
to herself that she should have paid more heed to
the warning of Head of S.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He’s a dedicated man,’ her chief had said when he gave
her the assignment. ‘Don’t imagine this is going to be any
fun. He thinks of nothing but the job on hand and, while
it’s on, he’s absolute hell to work for. But he’s an expert
and there aren’t many about, so you won’t be wasting your
time. He’s a good-looking chap, but don’t fall for him. I
don’t think he’s got much heart. Anyway, good luck and
don’t get hurt.’</p>

<p class="pindent">All this had been something of a challenge and she was
pleased when she felt she attracted and interested him, as
she knew intuitively that she did. Then at a hint that they
were finding pleasure together, a hint that was only the
first words of a conventional phrase, he had suddenly
turned to ice and had brutally veered away as if warmth
were poison to him. She felt hurt and foolish. Then she
gave a mental shrug and concentrated with all her attention
on what he was saying. She would not make the same
mistake again.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘. . . and the main hope is to pray for a run of luck for me,
or against him.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was explaining just how baccarat is played.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s much the same as any other gambling game. The
odds against the banker and the player are more or less
even. Only a run against either can be decisive and ‘break
the bank’, or break the players.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Tonight, Le Chiffre, we know, has bought the baccarat
bank from the Egyptian syndicate which is running the
high tables here. He paid a million francs for it and
his capital has been reduced to twenty-four million.
I have about the same. There will be ten players, I
expect, and we sit round the banker at a kidney-shaped
table.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Generally, this table is divided into two tableaux. The
banker plays two games, one against each of the tableaux
to left and right of him. In the game that banker should be
able to win by playing off one tableaux against the other and
by first-class accountancy. But there aren’t enough baccarat
players yet at Royale and Le Chiffre is just going to
pit his luck against the other players at the single tableau.
It’s unusual because the odds in favour of the banker aren’t
so good, but they’re a shade in his favour and, of course, he
has control of the size of the stakes.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, the banker sits there in the middle with a croupier
to take in the cards and call the amount of each bank and a
<span class="it">chef de partie</span> to umpire the game generally. I shall be sitting
as near dead opposite Le Chiffre as I can get. In front of
him he has a shoe containing six packs of cards, well
shuffled. There’s absolutely no chance of tampering with
the shoe. The cards are shuffled by the croupier and cut
by one of the players and put into the shoe in full view of
the table. We’ve checked on the staff and they’re all okay.
It would be useful, but almost impossible, to mark all the
cards, and it would mean the connivance at least of the
croupier. Anyway, we shall be watching for that too.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond drank some champagne and continued.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now what happens at the game is this. The banker
announces an opening bank of five hundred thousand
francs, of five hundred pounds as it is now. Each seat is
numbered from the right of the banker and the player next
to the banker, or Number 1, can accept this bet and push
his money out on to the table, or pass it, if it is too much
for him or he doesn’t want to take it. Then Number 2 has
the right to take it, and if he refuses, then Number 3, and so
on round the table. If no single player takes it all, the bet is
offered to the table as a whole and everyone chips in, including
sometimes the spectators round the table, until the
five hundred thousand is made up.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That is a small bet which would immediately be met,
but when it gets to a million or two it’s often difficult to
find a taker or even, if the bank seems to be in luck, a group
of takers to cover the bet. At the moment I shall always try
and step in and accept the bet—in fact, I shall attack Le
Chiffre’s bank whenever I get a chance until either I’ve
bust his bank or he’s bust me. It may take some time, but
in the end one of us is bound to break the other, irrespective
of the other players at the table, although they can, of
course, make him richer or poorer in the meantime.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Being the banker, he’s got a slight advantage in the
play, but knowing that I’m making a dead set at him and
not knowing, I hope, my capital, is bound to play on his
nerves a bit, so I’m hoping that we start about equal.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He paused while the strawberries came and the avocado
pear.</p>

<p class="pindent">For a while they ate in silence, then they talked of other
things while the coffee was served. They smoked. Neither
of them drank brandy or a liqueur. Finally, Bond felt it
was time to explain the actual mechanics of the game.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s a simple affair,’ he said, ‘and you’ll understand it
at once if you’ve ever played vingt-et-un, where the object
is to get cards from the banker which add up more closely
to a count of twenty-one than his do. In this game, I get
two cards and the banker gets two, and unless anyone wins
outright, either or both of us can get one more card. The
object of the game is to hold two, or three cards which together
count nine points, or as nearly nine as possible.
Court cards and tens count nothing; aces one each; any
other card its face value. It is only the last figure of your
count that signifies. So nine plus seven equals six—not
sixteen.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The winner is the one whose count is nearest to nine.
Draws are played over again.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Vesper listened attentively, but she also watched the
look of abstract passion on Bond’s face.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now,’ Bond continued, ‘when the banker deals me
my two cards, if they add up to eight or nine, they’re a
‘natural’ and I turn them up and I win, unless he has an
equal or a better natural. If I haven’t got a natural, I can
stand on a seven or a six, perhaps ask for a card or perhaps
not, on a five, and certainly ask for a card if my count is
lower than five. Five is the turning point of the game.
According to the odds, the chances of bettering or worsening
your hand if you hold a five are exactly even.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Only when I ask for a card or tap mine to signify that I
stand on what I have, can the banker look at his. If he has
a natural, he turns them up and wins. Otherwise he is
faced with the same problems as I was. But he is helped
in his decision to draw or not to draw a third card by my
actions. If I have stood, he must assume that I have a five,
six, or seven: if I have drawn, he will know that I had something
less than a six and I may have improved my hand
or not with the card he gave me. And this card was dealt
to me face up. On its face value and a knowledge of the
odds, he will know whether to take another card or to
stand on his own.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So he has a very slight advantage over me. He has a
tiny help over his decision to draw or to stand. But there
is always one problem card at this game—shall one draw or
stand on a five and what will your opponent do with a five?
Some players always draw or always stand. I follow my
intuition.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But in the end,’ Bond stubbed out his cigarette and
called for the bill, ‘it’s the natural eights and nines that
matter, and I must just see that I get more of them than he
does.’</p>
