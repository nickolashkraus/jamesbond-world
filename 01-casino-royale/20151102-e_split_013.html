<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre looked incuriously at him, the whites of
his eyes, which showed all round the irises, lending
something impassive and doll-like to his gaze.</p>

<p class="pindent">He slowly removed one thick hand from the table and
slipped it into the pocket of his dinner-jacket. The hand
came out holding a small metal cylinder with a cap which
Le Chiffre unscrewed. He inserted the nozzle of the cylinder,
with an obscene deliberation, twice into each black
nostril in turn, and luxuriously inhaled the benzedrine
vapour.</p>

<p class="pindent">Unhurriedly he pocketed the inhaler, then his hand came
quickly back above the level of the table and gave the shoe
its usual hard, sharp slap.</p>

<p class="pindent">During this offensive pantomime Bond had coldly held
the banker’s gaze, taking in the wide expanse of white face
surmounted by the short abrupt cliff of reddish-brown
hair, the unsmiling wet red mouth and the impressive
width of the shoulders, loosely draped in a massively cut
dinner-jacket.</p>

<p class="pindent">But for the high-lights on the satin of the shawl-cut
lapels, he might have been faced by the thick bust of a
black-fleeced Minotaur rising out of a green grass
field.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond slipped a packet of notes on to the table without
counting them. If he lost, the croupier would extract what
was necessary to cover the bet, but the easy gesture conveyed
that Bond didn’t expect to lose and that this was only
a token display from the deep funds at Bond’s disposal.</p>

<p class="pindent">The other players sensed a tension between the two
gamblers and there was silence as Le Chiffre fingered the
four cards out of the shoe.</p>

<p class="pindent">The croupier slipped Bond’s two cards across to him
with the tip of his spatula. Bond, still with his eyes holding
Le Chiffre’s, reached his right hand out a few inches,
glanced down very swiftly, then as he looked up again
impassively at Le Chiffre, with a disdainful gesture he
tossed the cards face upwards on the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">They were a four and a five—an unbeatable nine.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a little gasp of envy from the table and the
players to the left of Bond exchanged rueful glances at their
failure to accept the two million franc bet.</p>

<p class="pindent">With a hint of a shrug, Le Chiffre slowly faced his own
two cards and flicked them away with his fingernail. They
were two valueless knaves.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Le baccarat</span>,’ intoned the croupier as he spaded the
thick chips over the table to Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond slipped them into his right-hand pocket with the
unused packet of notes. His face showed no emotion, but
he was pleased with the success of his first coup and with
the outcome of the silent clash of wills across the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">The woman on his left, the American Mrs Du Pont,
turned to him with a wry smile.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I shouldn’t have let it come to you,’ she said. ‘Directly
the cards were dealt I kicked myself.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s only the beginning of the game,’ said Bond. ‘You
may be right the next time you pass it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr Du Pont leant forward from the other side of his
wife: ‘If one could be right every hand, none of us would
be here,’ he said philosophically.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I would be,’ his wife laughed. ‘You don’t think I do
this for pleasure.’</p>

<p class="pindent">As the game went on, Bond looked over the spectators
leaning on the high brass rail round the table. He soon
saw Le Chiffre’s two gunmen. They stood behind and to
either side of the banker. They looked respectable enough,
but not sufficiently a part of the game to be unobtrusive.</p>

<p class="pindent">The one more or less behind Le Chiffre’s right arm was
tall and funereal in his dinner-jacket. His face was wooden
and grey, but his eyes flickered and gleamed like a conjurer’s.
His whole long body was restless and his hands
shifted often on the brass rail. Bond guessed that he would
kill without interest or concern for what he killed and that
he would prefer strangling. He had something of Lennie in
<span class="it">Of Mice and Men</span>, but his inhumanity would not come
from infantilism but from drugs. Marihuana, decided Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">The other man looked like a Corsican shopkeeper. He
was short and very dark with a flat head covered with
thickly greased hair. He seemed to be a cripple. A chunky
malacca cane with a rubber tip hung on the rail beside him.
He must have had permission to bring the cane into the
Casino with him, reflected Bond, who knew that neither
sticks nor any other objects were allowed in the rooms as a
precaution against acts of violence. He looked sleek and
well fed. His mouth hung vacantly half-open and revealed
very bad teeth. He wore a heavy black moustache and the
backs of his hands on the rail were matted with black
hair. Bond guessed that hair covered most of his squat
body. Naked, Bond supposed, he would be an obscene
object.</p>

<p class="pindent">The game continued uneventfully, but with a slight bias
against the bank.</p>

<p class="pindent">The third coup is the ‘sound barrier’ at chemin-de-fer
and baccarat. Your luck can defeat the first and second
tests, but when the third deal comes along it most often
spells disaster. Again and again at this point you find yourself
being bounced back to earth. It was like that now.
Neither the bank nor any of the players seemed to be able
to get hot. But there was a steady and inexorable seepage
against the bank, amounting after about two hours’ play to
ten million francs. Bond had no idea what profits Le Chiffre
had made over the past two days. He estimated them at five
million and guessed that now the banker’s capital could not
be more than twenty million.</p>

<p class="pindent">In fact, Le Chiffre had lost heavily all that afternoon. At
this moment he only had ten million left.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond, on the other hand, by one o’clock in the morning,
had won four million, bringing his resources up to twenty-eight
million.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was cautiously pleased. Le Chiffre showed no trace
of emotion. He continued to play like an automaton, never
speaking except when he gave instructions in a low aside
to the croupier at the opening of each new bank.</p>

<p class="pindent">Outside the pool of silence round the high table, there
was the constant hum of the other tables, chemin-de-fer,
roulette and trente-et-quarante, interspersed with the clear
calls of the croupiers and occasional bursts of laughter or
gasps of excitement from different corners of the huge <span class="it">salle</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the background there thudded always the hidden
metronome of the Casino, ticking up its little treasure of
one-per-cents with each spin of a wheel and each turn of a
card—a pulsing fat-cat with a zero for a heart.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was at ten minutes past one by Bond’s watch when, at
the high table, the whole pattern of play suddenly altered.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Greek at Number 1 was still having a bad time. He
had lost the first coup of half a million francs and the
second. He passed the third time, leaving a bank of two
millions. Carmel Delane at Number 2 refused it. So did
Lady Danvers at Number 3.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Du Ponts looked at each other.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Banco</span>,’ said Mrs Du Pont, and promptly lost to the
banker’s natural eight.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Un banco de quatre millions</span>,’ said the croupier.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Banco</span>,’ said Bond, pushing out a wad of notes.</p>

<p class="pindent">Again he fixed Le Chiffre with his eye. Again he gave
only a cursory look at his two cards.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No,’ he said. He held a marginal five. The position was
dangerous.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre turned up a knave and a four. He gave the
shoe another slap. He drew a three.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Sept à la banque</span>,’ said the croupier, ‘<span class="it">et cinq</span>,’ he added as
he tipped Bond’s losing cards face upwards. He raked over
Bond’s money, extracted four million francs and returned
the remainder to Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Un banco de huit millions.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Suivi</span>,’ said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">And lost again, to a natural nine.</p>

<p class="pindent">In two coups he had lost twelve million francs. By
scraping the barrel, he had just sixteen million francs left,
exactly the amount of the next banco.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly Bond felt the sweat on his palms. Like snow in
sunshine his capital had melted. With the covetous deliberation
of the winning gambler, Le Chiffre was tapping a light
tattoo on the table with his right hand. Bond looked across
into the eyes of murky basalt. They held an ironical question.
‘Do you want the full treatment?’ they seemed to ask.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Suivi</span>,’ Bond said softly.</p>

<p class="pindent">He took some notes and plaques out of his right hand
pocket and the entire stack of notes out of his left and
pushed them forward. There was no hint in his movements
that this would be his last stake.</p>

<p class="pindent">His mouth felt suddenly as dry as flock wall-paper. He
looked up and saw Vesper and Felix Leiter standing where
the gunman with the stick had stood. He did not know how
long they had been standing there. Leiter looked faintly
worried, but Vesper smiled encouragement at him.</p>

<p class="pindent">He heard a faint rattle on the rail behind him and turned
his head. The battery of bad teeth under the black moustache
gaped vacantly back at him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Le jeu est fait</span>,’ said the croupier, and the two cards came
slithering towards him over the green baize—a green baize
which was no longer smooth, but thick now, and furry
and almost choking, its colour as livid as the grass on a
fresh tomb.</p>

<p class="pindent">The light from the broad satin-lined shades which had
seemed so welcoming now seemed to take the colour out of
his hand as he glanced at the cards. Then he looked again.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was nearly as bad as it could have been—the king of
hearts and an ace, the ace of spades. It squinted up at him
like a black widow spider.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A card.’ He still kept all emotion out of his voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre faced his own two cards. He had a queen and
a black five. He looked at Bond and pressed out another
card with a wide forefinger. The table was absolutely silent.
He faced it and flicked it away. The croupier lifted it
delicately with his spatula and slipped it over to Bond. It
was a good card, the five of hearts, but to Bond it was a
difficult fingerprint in dried blood. He now had a count of
six and Le Chiffre a count of five, but the banker having a
five and giving a five, would and must draw another card
and try and improve with a one, two, three or four. Drawing
any other card he would be defeated.</p>

<p class="pindent">The odds were on Bond’s side, but now it was Le Chiffre
who looked across into Bond’s eyes and hardly glanced at
the card as he flicked it face upwards on the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was, unnecessarily, the best, a four, giving the bank a
count of nine. He had won, almost slowing up.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was beaten and cleaned out.</p>
