<p class="pindent">As two weeks later, James Bond awoke in his room at
the Hôtel Splendide, some of this history passed
through his mind.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had arrived at Royale-les-Eaux in time for luncheon
two days before. There had been no attempt to contact
him and there had been no flicker of curiosity when
he had signed the register ‘James Bond, Port Maria,
Jamaica’.</p>

<p class="pindent">M had expressed no interest in his cover.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Once you start to make a set at Le Chiffre at the tables,
you’ll have had it,’ he said. ‘But wear a cover that will
stick with the general public.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond knew Jamaica well, so he asked to be controlled
from there and to pass as a Jamaican plantocrat whose
father had made his pile in tobacco and sugar and whose
son chose to play it away on the stock markets and in
casinos. If inquiries were made, he would quote Charles
DaSilva of Chaftery’s, Kingston, as his attorney. Charles
would make the story stick.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had spent the last two afternoons and most of the
nights at the Casino, playing complicated progression
systems on the even chances at roulette. He made a high
banco at chemin-de-fer whenever he heard one offered. If
he lost, he would <span class="it">suivi</span> once and not chase it further if
he lost the second time.</p>

<p class="pindent">In this way he had made some three million francs and
had given his nerves and card-sense a thorough work-out.
He had got the geography of the Casino clear in his mind.
Above all, he had been able to observe Le Chiffre at the
tables and to note ruefully that he was a faultless and lucky
gambler.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond liked to make a good breakfast. After a cold
shower, he sat at the writing-table in front of the window.
He looked out at the beautiful day and consumed half a
pint of iced orange juice, three scrambled eggs and bacon
and a double portion of coffee without sugar. He lit his
first cigarette, a Balkan and Turkish mixture made for him
by Morlands of Grosvenor Street, and watched the small
waves lick the long seashore and the fishing-fleet from
Dieppe string out towards the June heat-haze followed by
a paper-chase of herring-gulls.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was lost in his thoughts when the telephone rang. It
was the <span class="it">concierge</span> announcing that a Director of Radio
Stentor was waiting below with the wireless set he had
ordered from Paris.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course,’ said Bond. ‘Send him up.’</p>

<p class="pindent">This was the cover fixed by the Deuxième Bureau for
their liaison man with Bond. Bond watched the door,
hoping that it would be Mathis.</p>

<p class="pindent">When Mathis came in, a respectable business-man
carrying a large square parcel by its leather handle, Bond
smiled broadly and would have greeted him with warmth
if Mathis had not frowned and held up his free hand after
carefully closing the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I have just arrived from Paris, monsieur, and here is the
set you asked to have on approval—five valves, superhet, I
think you call it in England, and you should be able to get
most of the capitals of Europe from Royale. There are no
mountains for forty miles in any direction.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It sounds all right,’ said Bond, lifting his eyebrows at
this mystery-making.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis paid no attention. He placed the set, which he
had unwrapped, on the floor beside the unlit panel electric
fire below the mantelpiece.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It is just past eleven,’ he said, ‘and I see that the Compagnons
de la Chanson should now be on the medium wave
from Rome. They are touring Europe. Let us see what the
reception is like. It should be a fair test.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He winked. Bond noticed that he had turned the volume
on to full and that the red light indicating the long waveband
was illuminated, though the set was still silent.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis fiddled at the back of the set. Suddenly an appalling
roar of static filled the small room. Mathis gazed at
the set for a few seconds with benevolence and then turned
it off and his voice was full of dismay.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My dear monsieur—forgive me please—badly tuned,’
and he again bent to the dials. After a few adjustments the
close harmony of the French came over the air and Mathis
walked up and clapped Bond very hard on the back and
wrang his hand until Bond’s fingers ached.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled back at him. ‘Now, what the hell?’ he asked.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My dear friend,’ Mathis was delighted, ‘you are blown,
blown, blown. Up there,’ he pointed at the ceiling, ‘at
this moment, either Monsieur Muntz or his alleged wife,
allegedly bedridden with the <span class="it">grippe</span>, is deafened, absolutely
deafened, and I hope in agony.’ He grinned with pleasure
at Bond’s frown of disbelief.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis sat down on the bed and ripped open a packet of
Caporal with his thumbnail. Bond waited.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis was satisfied with the sensation his words had
caused. He became serious.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘How it has happened I don’t know. They must have
been on to you for several days before you arrived. The
opposition is here in real strength. Above you is the Muntz
family. He is German. She is from somewhere in Central
Europe, perhaps a Czech. This is an old-fashioned hotel.
There are disused chimneys behind these electric fires. Just
here,’ he pointed a few inches above the panel fire, ‘is
suspended a very powerful radio pick-up. The wires run
up the chimney to behind the Muntzes’ electric fire where
there is an amplifier. In their room is a wire-recorder and
a pair of earphones on which the Muntzes listen in turn.
That is why Madame Muntz has the <span class="it">grippe</span> and takes all
her meals in bed and why Monsieur Muntz has to be constantly
at her side instead of enjoying the sunshine and the
gambling of this delightful resort.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Some of this we knew because in France we are very
clever. The rest we confirmed by unscrewing your electric
fire a few hours before you got here.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Suspiciously Bond walked over and examined the screws
which secured the panel to the wall. Their grooves showed
minute scratches.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now it is time for a little more play-acting,’ said Mathis.
He walked over to the radio, which was still transmitting
close harmony to its audience of three, and switched it off.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Are you satisfied, monsieur?’ he asked. ‘You notice how
clearly they came over. Are they not a wonderful team?’
He made a winding motion with his right hand and raised
his eyebrows.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘They are so good,’ said Bond, ‘that I would like to hear
the rest of the programme.’ He grinned at the thought of
the angry glances which the Muntzes must be exchanging
overhead. ‘The machine itself seems splendid. Just what I
was looking for to take back to Jamaica.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis made a sarcastic grimace and switched back to
the Rome programme.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You and your Jamaica,’ he said, and sat down again on
the bed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond frowned at him. ‘Well, it’s no good crying over
spilt milk,’ he said. ‘We didn’t expect the cover to stick for
long, but it’s worrying that they bowled it out so soon.’ He
searched his mind in vain for a clue. Could the Russians
have broken one of our ciphers? If so, he might just as well
pack up and go home. He and his job would have been
stripped naked.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis seemed to read his mind. ‘It can’t have been a
cipher,’ he said. ‘Anyway, we told London at once and they
will have changed them. A pretty flap we caused, I can tell
you.’ He smiled with the satisfaction of a friendly rival.
‘And now to business, before our good “Compagnons”
run out of breath.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘First of all,’ and he inhaled a thick lungful of Caporal,
‘you will be pleased with your Number Two. She is very
beautiful’—Bond frowned—‘very beautiful indeed.’
Satisfied with Bond’s reaction, Mathis continued: ‘She has
black hair, blue eyes, and splendid . . . er . . . protuberances.
Back and front,’ he added. ‘And she is a wireless expert
which, though sexually less interesting, makes her a perfect
employee of Radio Stentor and assistant to myself in my
capacity as wireless salesman for this rich summer season
down here.’ He grinned. ‘We are both staying in the hotel
and my assistant will thus be on hand in case your new
radio breaks down. All new machines, even French ones,
are apt to have teething troubles in the first day or two.
And occasionally at night,’ he added with an exaggerated
wink.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was not amused. ‘What the hell do they want to
send me a woman for?’ he said bitterly. ‘Do they think this
is a bloody picnic?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis interrupted. ‘Calm yourself, my dear James. She
is as serious as you could wish and as cold as an icicle. She
speaks French like a native and knows her job backwards.
Her cover’s perfect and I have arranged for her to team up
with you quite smoothly. What is more natural than that
you should pick up a pretty girl here? As a Jamaican
millionaire,’ he coughed respectfully, ‘what with your hot
blood and all, you would look naked without one.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond grunted dubiously.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Any other surprises?’ he asked suspiciously.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Nothing very much,’ answered Mathis. ‘Le Chiffre is
installed in his villa. It’s about ten miles down the coast
road. He has his two guards with him. They look pretty
capable fellows. One of them has been seen visiting a little
“pension” in the town where three mysterious and rather
subhuman characters checked in two days ago. They may
be part of the team. Their papers are in order—stateless
Czechs apparently—but one of our men says the language
they talk in their room is Bulgarian. We don’t see many of
those around. They’re mostly used against the Turks and
the Yugoslavs. They’re stupid, but obedient. The Russians
use them for simple killings or as fall-guys for more complicated
ones.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thanks very much. Which is mine to be?’ asked Bond.
‘Anything else?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No. Come to the bar of the Hermitage before lunch.
I’ll fix the introduction. Ask her to dinner this evening.
Then it will be natural for her to come into the Casino
with you. I’ll be there too, but in the background. I’ve got
one or two good chaps and we’ll keep an eye on you. Oh,
and there’s an American called Leiter here, staying in the
hotel. Felix Leiter. He’s the CIA chap from Fontainebleau.
London told me to tell you. He looks okay. May come in
useful.’</p>

<p class="pindent">A torrent of Italian burst from the wireless set on the
floor. Mathis switched it off and they exchanged some
phrases about the set and about how Bond should pay for
it. Then with effusive farewells and a final wink Mathis
bowed himself out.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat at the window and gathered his thoughts.
Nothing that Mathis had told him was reassuring. He was
completely blown and under really professional surveillance.
An attempt might be made to put him away before he
had a chance to pit himself against Le Chiffre at the tables.
The Russians had no stupid prejudices about murder. And
then there was this pest of a girl. He sighed. Women were
for recreation. On a job, they got in the way and fogged
things up with sex and hurt feelings and all the emotional
baggage they carried around. One had to look out for them
and take care of them.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Bitch,’ said Bond, and then remembering the Muntzes,
he said ‘bitch’ again more loudly and walked out of the
room.</p>
