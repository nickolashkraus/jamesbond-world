<p class="pindent">Bond walked up to his room, which again showed no
sign of trespass, threw off his clothes, took a long hot
bath followed by an ice-cold shower and lay down on his
bed. There remained an hour in which to rest and compose
his thoughts before he met the girl in the Splendide bar, an
hour to examine minutely the details of his plans for the
game, and for after the game, in all the various circumstances
of victory or defeat. He had to plan the attendant
roles of Mathis, Leiter, and the girl and visualize the reactions
of the enemy in various contingencies. He closed
his eyes and his thoughts pursued his imagination through
a series of carefully constructed scenes as if he was watching
the tumbling chips of coloured glass in a kaleidoscope.</p>

<p class="pindent">At twenty minutes to nine he had exhausted all the
permutations which might result from his duel with Le
Chiffre. He rose and dressed, dismissing the future completely
from his mind.</p>

<p class="pindent">As he tied his thin, double-ended, black satin tie, he
paused for a moment and examined himself levelly in the
mirror. His grey-blue eyes looked calmly back with a hint
of ironical inquiry and the short lock of black hair which
would never stay in place slowly subsided to form a thick
comma above his right eyebrow. With the thin vertical
scar down his right cheek the general effect was faintly
piratical. Not much of Hoagy Carmichael there, thought
Bond, as he filled a flat, light gunmetal box with fifty of the
Morland cigarettes with the triple gold band. Mathis had
told him of the girl’s comment.</p>

<p class="pindent">He slipped the case into his hip pocket and snapped his
oxidized Ronson to see if it needed fuel. After pocketing
the thin sheaf of ten-mille notes, he opened a drawer and
took out a light chamois leather holster and slipped it over
his left shoulder so that it hung about three inches below his
arm-pit. He then took from under his shirts in another
drawer a very flat ·25 Beretta automatic with a skeleton
grip, extracted the clip and the single round in the barrel
and whipped the action to and fro several times, finally
pulling the trigger on the empty chamber. He charged
the weapon again, loaded it, put up the safety catch and
dropped it into the shallow pouch of the shoulder-holster.
He looked carefully round the room to see if anything had
been forgotten and slipped his single-breasted dinner-jacket
coat over his heavy silk evening shirt. He felt cool
and comfortable. He verified in the mirror that there was
absolutely no sign of the flat gun under his left arm, gave a
final pull at his narrow tie and walked out of the door and
locked it.</p>

<p class="pindent">When he turned at the foot of the short stairs towards the
bar he heard the lift-door open behind him and a cool
voice call ‘Good evening’.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was the girl. She stood and waited for him to come up
to her.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had remembered her beauty exactly. He was not
surprised to be thrilled by it again.</p>

<p class="pindent">Her dress was of black velvet, simple and yet with the
touch of splendour that only half a dozen <span class="it">couturiers</span> in the
world can achieve. There was a thin necklace of diamonds
at her throat and a diamond clip in the low vee which just
exposed the jutting swell of her breasts. She carried a
plain black evening bag, a flat object which she now held,
her arm akimbo, at her waist. Her jet black hair hung
straight and simple to the final inward curl below the
chin.</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked quite superb and Bond’s heart lifted.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You look absolutely lovely. Business must be good in
the radio world!’</p>

<p class="pindent">She put her arm through his. ‘Do you mind if we go
straight into dinner?’ she asked. ‘I want to make a grand
entrance and the truth is there’s a horrible secret about
black velvet. It marks when you sit down. And, by the
way, if you hear me scream tonight, I shall have sat on a
cane chair.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. ‘Of course, let’s go straight in. We’ll
have a glass of vodka while we order our dinner.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She gave him an amused glance and he corrected himself:
‘Or a cocktail, of course, if you prefer it. The food
here’s the best in Royale.’</p>

<p class="pindent">For an instant he felt nettled at the irony, the light
shadow of a snub, with which she had met his decisiveness,
and at the way he had risen to her quick glance.</p>

<p class="pindent">But it was only an infinitesimal clink of foils and as the
bowing <span class="it">maître d’hôtel</span> led them through the crowded room,
it was forgotten as Bond in her wake watched the heads of
the diners turn to look at her.</p>

<p class="pindent">The fashionable part of the restaurant was beside the
wide crescent of window built out like the broad stern of a
ship over the hotel gardens, but Bond had chosen a table in
one of the mirrored alcoves at the back of the great room.
These had survived from the Edwardian days and they
were secluded and gay in white and gilt, with the red silk-shaded
table and wall lights of the late Empire.</p>

<p class="pindent">As they deciphered the maze of purple ink which covered
the double folio menu, Bond beckoned to the <span class="it">sommelier</span>. He
turned to his companion.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Have you decided?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I would love a glass of vodka,’ she said simply, and
went back to her study of the menu.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A small carafe of vodka, very cold,’ ordered Bond. He
said to her abruptly: ‘I can’t drink the health of your new
frock without knowing your Christian name.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Vesper,’ she said. ‘Vesper Lynd.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond gave her a look of inquiry.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s rather a bore always having to explain, but I was
born in the evening, on a very stormy evening according to
my parents. Apparently they wanted to remember it.’ She
smiled. ‘Some people like it, others don’t. I’m just used to
it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I think it’s a fine name,’ said Bond. An idea struck him.
‘Can I borrow it?’ He explained about the special martini he
had invented and his search for a name for it. ‘The Vesper,’
he said. ‘It sounds perfect and it’s very appropriate to
the violet hour when my cocktail will now be drunk all
over the world. Can I have it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So long as I can try one first,’ she promised. ‘It sounds
a drink to be proud of.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We’ll have one together when all this is finished,’ said
Bond. ‘Win or lose. And now have you decided what
you would like to have for dinner? Please be expensive,’
he added as he sensed her hesitation, ‘or you’ll let down
that beautiful frock.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’d made two choices,’ she laughed, ‘and either would
have been delicious, but behaving like a millionaire occasionally
is a wonderful treat and if you’re sure . . . well, I’d
like to start with caviar and then have a plain grilled <span class="it">rognon
de veau</span> with <span class="it">pommes soufflés</span>. And then I’d like to have
<span class="it">fraises des bois</span> with a lot of cream. Is it very shameless to be
so certain and so expensive?’ She smiled at him inquiringly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s a virtue, and anyway it’s only a good plain wholesome
meal.’ He turned to the <span class="it">maître d’hôtel</span>, ‘and bring
plenty of toast.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The trouble always is,’ he explained to Vesper, ‘not
how to get enough caviar, but how to get enough toast
with it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now,’ he turned back to the menu, ‘I myself will
accompany Mademoiselle with the caviar, but then I would
like a very small <span class="it">tournedos</span>, underdone, with <span class="it">sauce Béarnaise</span>
and a <span class="it">coeur d’artichaut</span>. While Mademoiselle is enjoying
the strawberries, I will have half an avocado pear with
a little French dressing. Do you approve?’</p>

<p class="pindent">The <span class="it">maître d’hôtel</span> bowed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My compliments, mademoiselle and monsieur. Monsieur
George,’ he turned to the <span class="it">sommelier</span> and repeated the
two dinners for his benefit.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Parfait</span>’ said the <span class="it">sommelier</span>, proffering the leather-bound
wine list.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘If you agree,’ said Bond, ‘I would prefer to drink
champagne with you tonight. It is a cheerful wine and it
suits the occasion—I hope,’ he added.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes I would like champagne,’ she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">With his finger on the page, Bond turned to the <span class="it">sommelier</span>:
‘The Taittinger 45?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A fine wine, monsieur,’ said the <span class="it">sommelier</span>. ‘But if
Monsieur will permit,’ he pointed with his pencil, ‘the
Blanc de Blanc Brut 1943 of the same marque is without
equal.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled. ‘So be it,’ he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That is not a well-known brand,’ Bond explained to
his companion, ‘but it is probably the finest champagne in
the world.’ He grinned suddenly at the touch of pretension
in his remark.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You must forgive me,’ he said. ‘I take a ridiculous
pleasure in what I eat and drink. It comes partly from being
a bachelor, but mostly from a habit of taking a lot of
trouble over details. It’s very pernickety and old-maidish
really, but then when I’m working I generally have to eat
my meals alone and it makes them more interesting when
one takes trouble.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Vesper smiled at him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I like it,’ she said. ‘I like doing everything fully,
getting the most out of everything one does. I think that’s
the way to live. But it sounds rather schoolgirlish when
one says it,’ she added apologetically.</p>

<p class="pindent">The little carafe of vodka had arrived in its bowl of
crushed ice and Bond filled their glasses.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, I agree with you anyway,’ he said, ‘and now,
here’s luck for tonight, Vesper.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ said the girl quietly, as she held up her small glass
and looked at him with a curious directness straight in the
eyes. ‘I hope all will go well tonight.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She seemed to Bond to give a quick involuntary shrug of
the shoulders as she spoke, but then she leant impulsively
towards him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I have some news for you from Mathis. He was longing
to tell you himself. It’s about the bomb. It’s a fantastic
story.’</p>
