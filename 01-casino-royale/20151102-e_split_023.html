<p class="pindent">It was on the next day that Bond asked to see Vesper.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had not wanted to see her before. He was told that
every day she came to the nursing home and asked after
him. Flowers had arrived from her. Bond didn’t like
flowers and he told the nurse to give them to another
patient. After this had happened twice, no more flowers came.
Bond had not meant to offend her. He disliked having
feminine things around him. Flowers seemed to ask for
recognition of the person who had sent them, to be constantly
transmitting a message of sympathy and affection.
Bond found this irksome. He disliked being cosseted. It
gave him claustrophobia.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was bored at the idea of having to explain some of
this to Vesper. And he was embarrassed at having to ask
one or two questions which mystified him, questions about
Vesper’s behaviour. The answers would almost certainly
make her out to be a fool. Then he had his full report to
M to think about. In this he didn’t want to have to criticize
Vesper. It might easily cost her her job.</p>

<p class="pindent">But above all, he admitted to himself, he shirked the
answer to a more painful question.</p>

<p class="pindent">The doctor had talked often to Bond about his injuries.
He had always told him that there would be no evil effects
from the terrible battering his body had received. He had
said that Bond’s full health would return and that none of
his powers had been taken from him. But the evidence of
Bond’s eyes and his nerves refused these comforting assurances.
He was still painfully swollen and bruised and
whenever the injections wore off he was in agony. Above
all, his imagination had suffered. For an hour in that room
with Le Chiffre the certainty of impotence had been beaten
into him and a scar had been left on his mind that could
only be healed by experience.</p>

<p class="pindent">From that day when Bond first met Vesper in the Hermitage
bar, he had found her desirable and he knew that if
things had been different in the night-club, if Vesper had
responded in any way and if there had been no kidnapping
he would have tried to sleep with her that night. Even
later, in the car and outside the villa when God knows he
had had other things to think about, his eroticism had been
hotly aroused by the sight of her indecent nakedness.</p>

<p class="pindent">And now when he could see her again, he was afraid.
Afraid that his senses and his body would not respond to
her sensual beauty. Afraid that he would feel no stir of
desire and that his blood would stay cool. In his mind he
had made this first meeting into a test and he was shirking
the answer. That was the real reason, he admitted, why he
had waited to give his body a chance to respond, why he
had put off their first meeting for over a week. He would
like to have put off the meeting still further, but he explained
to himself that his report must be written, that any
day an emissary from London would come over and want
to hear the full story, that today was as good as tomorrow,
that anyway he might as well know the worst.</p>

<p class="pindent">So on the eighth day he asked for her, for the early
morning when he was feeling refreshed and strong after the
night’s rest.</p>

<p class="pindent">For no reason at all, he had expected that she would show
some sign of her experiences, that she would look pale and
even ill. He was not prepared for the tall bronzed girl in a
cream tussore frock with a black belt who came happily
through the door and stood smiling at him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good heavens, Vesper,’ he said with a wry gesture of
welcome, ‘you look absolutely splendid. You must thrive
on disaster. How have you managed to get such a wonderful
sunburn?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I feel very guilty,’ she said sitting down beside him.
‘But I’ve been bathing every day while you’ve been lying
here. The doctor said I was to and Head of S said I was to,
so, well, I just thought it wouldn’t help you for me to be
moping away all day long in my room. I’ve found a wonderful
stretch of sand down the coast and I take my lunch
and go there every day with a book and I don’t come back
till the evening. There’s a bus that takes me there and back
with only a short walk over the dunes, and I’ve managed
to get over the fact that it’s on the way down that road to
the villa.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Her voice faltered.</p>

<p class="pindent">The mention of the villa had made Bond’s eyes flicker.</p>

<p class="pindent">She continued bravely, refusing to be defeated by Bond’s
lack of response.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘The doctor says it won’t be long before you’re allowed
up. I thought perhaps . . . I thought perhaps I could take
you down to this beach later on. The doctor says that
bathing would be very good for you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond grunted.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘God knows when I’ll be able to bathe,’ he said. ‘The
doctor’s talking through his hat. And when I can bathe it
would probably be better for me to bathe alone for a
bit. I don’t want to frighten anybody. Apart from anything
else,’ he glanced pointedly down the bed, ‘my body’s a
mass of scars and bruises. But you enjoy yourself. There’s
no reason why you shouldn’t enjoy yourself.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Vesper was stung by the bitterness and injustice in his
voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m sorry,’ she said, ‘I just thought . . . I was just
trying . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly her eyes filled with tears. She swallowed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I wanted . . . I wanted to help you get well.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Her voice strangled. She looked piteously at him, facing
the accusation in his eyes and in his manner.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then she broke down and buried her face in her hands
and sobbed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m sorry,’ she said in a muffled voice. ‘I’m really
sorry.’ With one hand she searched for a handkerchief in
her bag. ‘It’s all my fault,’ she dabbed at her eyes. ‘I know
it’s all my fault.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond at once relented. He put out a bandaged hand
and laid it on her knee.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s all right, Vesper. I’m sorry I was so rough. It’s
just that I was jealous of you in the sunshine while I’m
stuck here. Directly I’m well enough I’ll come with you
and you must show me your beach. Of course it’s just
what I want. It’ll be wonderful to get out again.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She pressed his hand and stood up and walked over to
the window. After a moment she busied herself with her
make-up. Then she came back to the bed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked at her tenderly. Like all harsh, cold men, he
was easily tipped over into sentiment. She was very beautiful
and he felt warm towards her. He decided to make his
questions as easy as possible.</p>

<p class="pindent">He gave her a cigarette and for a time they talked of the
visit of Head of S and of the reactions in London to the
rout of Le Chiffre.</p>

<p class="pindent">From what she said it was clear that the final object of the
plan had been more than fulfilled. The story was still being
splashed all over the world and correspondents of most of
the English and American papers had been at Royale trying
to trace the Jamaican millionaire who had defeated Le
Chiffre at the tables. They had got on to Vesper, but she
had covered up well. Her story was that Bond had told her
he was going on to Cannes and Monte Carlo to gamble
with his winnings. The hunt had moved down to the South
of France. Mathis and the police had obliterated all other
traces and the papers were forced to concentrate on the
Strasbourg angles and the chaos in the ranks of the French
Communists.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘By the way, Vesper,’ said Bond after a time. ‘What
really happened to you after you left me in the night club?
All I saw was the actual kidnapping.’ He told her briefly of
the scene outside the Casino.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m afraid I must have lost my head,’ said Vesper, avoiding
Bond’s eyes. ‘When I couldn’t see Mathis anywhere
in the entrance hall I went outside and the commissionaire
asked me if I was Miss Lynd, and then told me the man
who had sent in the note was waiting in a car down on the
right of the steps. Somehow I wasn’t particularly surprised.
I’d only known Mathis for a day or two and I didn’t know
how he worked, so I just walked down towards the car. It
was away on the right and more or less in the shadows.
Just as I was coming up to it, Le Chiffre’s two men jumped
out from behind one of the other cars in the row and simply
scooped my skirt over my head.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Vesper blushed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It sounds a childish trick,’ she looked penitently at
Bond, ‘but it’s really frightfully effective. One’s a complete
prisoner and although I screamed I don’t expect any
sound came out from under my skirt. I kicked out as hard
as I could, but that was no use as I couldn’t see and my
arms were absolutely helpless. I was just a trussed chicken.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘They picked me up between them and shoved me into
the back of the car. I went on struggling, of course, and
when the car started and while they were trying to tie a
rope or something round the top of my skirt over my head,
I managed to get an arm free and throw my bag through the
window. I hope it was some use.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond nodded.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It was rather instinctive. I just thought you’d have no
idea what had happened to me and I was terrified. I did the
first thing I could think of.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond knew that it was him they had been after and that
if Vesper hadn’t thrown her bag out, they would probably
have thrown it out themselves directly they saw him
appear on the steps.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It certainly helped,’ said Bond, ‘but why didn’t you
make any sign when they finally got me after the car smash,
when I spoke to you? I was dreadfully worried. I thought
they might have knocked you out or something.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m afraid I must have been unconscious,’ said Vesper.
‘I fainted once from lack of air and when I came to they
had cut a hole in front of my face. I must have fainted
again. I don’t remember much until we got to the villa. I
really only gathered you had been captured when I heard
you try and come after me in the passage.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘And they didn’t touch you?’ asked Bond. ‘They didn’t
try and mess about with you while I was being beaten up?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No,’ said Vesper. ‘They just left me in an arm-chair.
They drank and played cards—“belotte” I think it was
from what I heard—and then they went to sleep. I suppose
that was how <span class="sc">smersh</span> got them. They bound my legs and
put me on a chair in a corner facing the wall and I saw
nothing of <span class="sc">smersh</span>. I heard some odd noises. I expect they
woke me up. And then what sounded like one of them
falling off his chair. Then there were some soft footsteps
and a door closed and then nothing happened until Mathis
and the police burst in hours later. I slept most of the time.
I had no idea what had happened to you, but,’ she faltered,
‘I did once hear a terrible scream. It sounded very far
away. At least, I think it must have been a scream. At the
time I thought it might have been a nightmare.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m afraid that must have been me,’ said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">Vesper put out a hand and touched one of his. Her eyes
filled with tears.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s horrible,’ she said. ‘The things they did to you. And
it was all my fault. If only . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">She buried her face in her hands.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s all right,’ said Bond comfortingly. ‘It’s no good
crying over spilt milk. It’s all over now and thank heavens
they let you alone.’ He patted her knee. ‘They were going
to start on you when they’d got me really softened up,’
(softened up is good, he thought to himself). ‘We’ve got a
lot to thank <span class="sc">smersh</span> for. Now, come on, let’s forget about
it. It certainly wasn’t anything to do with you. Anybody
could have fallen for that note. Anyway, it’s all water over
the dam,’ he added cheerfully.</p>

<p class="pindent">Vesper looked at him gratefully through her tears. ‘You
really promise?’ she asked. ‘I thought you would never
forgive me. I . . . I’ll try and make it up to you. Somehow.’
She looked at him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Somehow? thought Bond to himself. He looked at her.
She was smiling at him. He smiled back.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’d better look out,’ he said. ‘I may hold you to
that.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked into his eyes and said nothing, but the
enigmatic challenge was back. She pressed his hand and
rose. ‘A promise is a promise,’ she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">This time they both knew what the promise was.</p>

<p class="pindent">She picked up her bag from the bed and walked to the
door.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Shall I come tomorrow?’ She looked at Bond gravely.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, please, Vesper,’ said Bond. ‘I’d like that. Please
do some more exploring. It will be fun to think of what
we can do when I get up. Will you think of some things?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes,’ said Vesper. ‘Please get well quickly.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They gazed at each other for a second. Then she went
out and closed the door and Bond listened until the sound
of her footsteps had disappeared.</p>
