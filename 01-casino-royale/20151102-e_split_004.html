<p class="pindent">Two weeks before, this memorandum had gone from
Station S of the Secret Service to M, who was then
and is today head of this adjunct to the British Defence
Ministries:</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="hang"><span class="it">To</span>: M.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="it">From</span>: Head of S.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="it">Subject</span>: A project for the destruction of Monsieur Le
Chiffre (alias ‘The Number’, ‘Herr Nummer’, ‘Herr
Ziffer’, etc.), one of the Opposition’s chief agents in
France and undercover Paymaster of the ‘Syndicat des
Ouvriers d’Alsace’, the Communist-controlled trade
union in the heavy and transport industries of Alsace,
and as we know, an important fifth column in the event
of war with Redland.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="it">Documentation</span>: Head of Archives’ biography of Le Chiffre
is attached at <span class="it">Appendix A</span>. Also, <span class="it">Appendix B</span>, a note on
<span class="sc">smersh</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">We have been feeling for some time that Le Chiffre is
getting into deep water. In nearly all respects he is an
admirable agent of the USSR, but his gross physical
habits and predilections are an Achilles heel of which we
have been able to take advantage from time to time and one
of his mistresses is a Eurasian (No 1860) controlled by
Station F, who has recently been able to obtain insight
into his private affairs.</p>

<p class="pindent">Briefly, it seems that Le Chiffre is on the brink of a
financial crisis. Certain straws in the wind were noticed by
1860—some discreet sales of jewellery, the disposal of a
villa at Antibes, and a general tendency to check the loose
spending which has always been a feature of his way of life.
Further inquiries were made with the help of our friends of
the Deuxième Bureau (with whom we have been working
jointly on this case) and a curious story has come to light.</p>

<p class="pindent">In January 1946, Le Chiffre bought control of a chain
of brothels, known as the Cordon Jaune, operating in
Normandy and Brittany. He was foolish enough to employ
for this purpose some fifty million francs of the
moneys entrusted to him by Leningrad Section III for the
financing of SODA, the trade union mentioned above.</p>

<p class="pindent">Normally the Cordon Jaune would have proved a most
excellent investment and it is possible that Le Chiffre was
motivated more by a desire to increase his union funds than
by the hope of lining his own pocket by speculating with
his employers’ money. However that may be, it is clear
that he could have found many investments more savoury
than prostitution, if he had not been tempted by the byproduct
of unlimited women for his personal use.</p>

<p class="pindent">Fate rebuked him with terrifying swiftness.</p>

<p class="pindent">Barely three months later, on 13 April, there was passed
in France Law No. 46685 entitled <span class="it">Loi Tendant à la Fermeture
des Maisons de Tolérance et au Renforcement de la
Lutte contre le Proxénitisme</span>.</p>

</div>

<p class="pindent">(When M came to this sentence he grunted and pressed
a switch on the intercom.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Head of S?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What the hell does this word mean?’ He spelt it out.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Pimping, sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘This is not the Berlitz School of Languages, Head of S.
If you want to show off your knowledge of foreign jawbreakers,
be good enough to provide a crib. Better still,
write in English.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sorry, sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">M released the switch and turned back to the memorandum.)</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="pindent">This law [he read] known popularly as ‘La Loi Marthe
Richard’, closing all houses of ill-fame and forbidding the
sale of pornographic books and films knocked the bottom
out of his investment almost overnight and suddenly Le
Chiffre was faced with a serious deficit in his union funds.
In desperation he turned his open houses into <span class="it">maisons de
passe</span>, where clandestine rendezvous could be arranged on
the border-line of the law, and he continued to operate one
or two <span class="it">cinémas bleus</span> underground, but these shifts in no
way served to cover his overheads, and all attempts to sell
his investment, even at a heavy loss, failed dismally.
Meanwhile the Police des Mœurs were on his trail and in a
short while twenty or more of his establishments were
closed down.</p>

<p class="pindent">The police were, of course, only interested in this man
as a big-time brothel-keeper and it was not until we expressed
an interest in his finances that the Deuxième
Bureau unearthed the parallel dossier which was running
with their colleagues of the police department.</p>

<p class="pindent">The significance of the situation became apparent to us
and to our French friends and, in the past few months, a
veritable rat-hunt has been operated by the police after the
establishments of the Cordon Jaune, with the result that
today nothing remains of Le Chiffre’s original investment
and any routine inquiry would reveal a deficit of around
fifty million francs in the trade union funds of which he is
the treasurer and paymaster.</p>

<p class="pindent">It does not seem that the suspicions of Leningrad have
been aroused yet but, unfortunately for Le Chiffre, it is
possible that at any rate <span class="sc">smersh</span> is on the scent. Last week
a high-grade source of Station P reported that a senior
official of this efficient organ of Soviet vengeance had left
Warsaw for Strasbourg via the Eastern sector of Berlin.
There is no confirmation of this report from the Deuxième
Bureau, nor from the authorities in Strasbourg (who
are reliable and thorough) and there is also no news from
Le Chiffre’s headquarters there, which we have well
covered by a double agent (in addition to 1860).</p>

<p class="pindent">If Le Chiffre knew that <span class="sc">smersh</span> was on his tail or that
they had the smallest suspicion of him, he would have no
alternative but to commit suicide or attempt to escape, but
his present plans suggest that while he is certainly desperate,
he does not yet realize that his life may be at stake. It is
these rather spectacular plans of his that have suggested
to us a counter-operation which, though risky and unconventional
we submit at the end of this memorandum
with confidence.</p>

<p class="pindent">In brief, Le Chiffre plans, we believe, to follow the
example of most other desperate till-robbers and make good
the deficit in his accounts by gambling. The ‘Bourse’ is
too slow. So are the various illicit traffics in drugs, or rare
medicines, such as aureo- and streptomycin and cortisone.
No race-tracks could carry the sort of stakes he will have to
play and, if he wins, he would more likely be killed than
paid off.</p>

<p class="pindent">In any case, we know that he has withdrawn the final
twenty-five million francs from the treasury of his union
and that he has taken a small villa in the neighbourhood of
Royale-les-Eaux, just north of Dieppe, for a week from a
fortnight tomorrow.</p>

<p class="pindent">Now, it is expected that the Casino at Royale will see the
highest gambling in Europe this summer. In an effort to
wrest the big money from Deauville and Le Touquet, the
Société des Bains de Mers de Royale have leased the baccarat
and the two top chemin-de-fer tables to the Mahomet
Ali Syndicate, a group of <span class="it">émigré</span> Egyptian bankers and
business-men with, it is said, a call on certain royal funds,
who have for years been trying to cut in on the profits of
Zographos and his Greek associates resulting from their
monopoly of the highest French baccarat banks.</p>

<p class="pindent">With the help of discreet publicity, a considerable
number of the biggest operators in America and Europe
have been encouraged to book at Royale this summer and
it seems possible that this old-fashioned watering-place
will regain some of its Victorian renown.</p>

<p class="pindent">Be that as it may, it is here that Le Chiffre will, we
are confident, endeavour on or after 15 June to make a
profit at baccarat of fifty million francs on a working
capital of twenty-five million. (And, incidentally, save his
life.)</p>

<p class="noindent"><span class="it">Proposed Counter-operation</span></p>

<p class="pindent">It would be greatly in the interests of this country and of
the other nations of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
that this powerful Soviet agent should be ridiculed and
destroyed, that his Communist trade union should be
bankrupted and brought into disrepute, and that this
potential fifth column, with a strength of 50,000, capable in
time of war of controlling a wide sector of France’s northern
frontier, should lose faith and cohesion. All this would
result if Le Chiffre could be defeated at the tables. (NB.
Assassination is pointless. Leningrad would quickly cover
up his defalcations and make him into a martyr.)</p>

<p class="pindent">We therefore recommend that the finest gambler available
to the Service should be given the necessary funds and
endeavour to out-gamble this man.</p>

<p class="pindent">The risks are obvious and the possible loss to the Secret
funds is high, but other operations on which large sums
have been hazarded have had fewer chances of success,
often for a smaller objective.</p>

<p class="pindent">If the decision is unfavourable, the only alternative
would be to place our information and our recommendations
in the hands of the Deuxième Bureau or of our
American colleagues of the Central Intelligence Agency
in Washington. Both of these organizations would doubtless
be delighted to take over the scheme.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="it">Comment</span>: A formidable and dangerous agent of the

Paris.</p>

<p class="line5">Signed: Archivist.</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="it">Appendix B.</span></p>

<p class="hang"><span class="it">Subject</span>: <span class="sc">Smersh</span></p>

<p class="hang"><span class="it">Sources</span>: Own archives and scanty material made available
by Deuxième Bureau and CIA Washington.</p>

<p class="pindent"><span class="sc">Smersh</span> is a conjunction of two Russian words:
‘Smyert Shpionam’, meaning roughly: ‘Death to Spies’.</p>

<p class="pindent">Ranks above MWD (formerly NKVD) and is
believed to come under the personal direction of Beria.</p>

<p class="pindent">Headquarters: Leningrad (sub-station at Moscow).</p>

<p class="pindent">Its tasks is the elimination of all forms of treachery
and back-sliding with the various branches of the Soviet
Secret Service and Secret Police at home and abroad.
It is the most powerful and feared organization in the
USSR and is popularly believed never to have failed in
a mission of vengeance.</p>

<p class="pindent">It is thought that <span class="sc">smersh</span> was responsible for the
assassination of Trotsky in Mexico (22 August 1940) and
may indeed have made its name with this successful
murder after attempts by other Russian individuals and
organizations had failed.</p>

<p class="pindent"><span class="sc">Smersh</span> was next heard of when Hitler attacked
Russia. It was then rapidly expanded to cope with
treachery and double agents during the retreat of the
Soviet forces in 1941. At that time it worked as an execution
squad for the NKVD and its present selective
mission was not so clearly defined.</p>

<p class="pindent">The organization itself was thoroughly purged after
the war and is now believed to consist of only a few
hundred operatives of very high quality divided into
five sections:</p>

<p class="hang">Department I: In charge of counter-intelligence
among Soviet organizations at home and abroad.</p>

<p class="hang">Department II: Operations, including executions.</p>

<p class="hang">Department III: Administration and Finance.</p>

<p class="hang">Department IV: Investigations and legal work.
Personnel.</p>

<p class="hang">Department V: Prosecutions: the section which
passes final judgement on all victims.</p>

<p class="pindent">Only one <span class="sc">smersh</span> operative has come into our hands
since the war: Goytchev, alias Garrad-Jones. He shot
Petchora, medical officer at the Yugoslav Embassy, in
Hyde Park, 7 August 1948. During interrogation he
committed suicide by swallowing a coat-button of compressed
potassium cyanide. He revealed nothing beyond
his membership of <span class="sc">smersh</span>, of which he was arrogantly
boastful.</p>

<p class="pindent">We believe that the following British double agents
were victims of <span class="sc">smersh</span>: Donovan, Harthrop-Vane,
Elizabeth Dumont, Ventnor, Mace, Savarin. (For details
see Morgue: Section Q.)</p>

<p class="hang"><span class="it">Conclusion</span>: Every effort should be made to improve our
knowledge of this very powerful organization and
destroy its operatives.</p>
