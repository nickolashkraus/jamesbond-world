<p class="pindent">They were talking on the threshold of Vesper’s room.</p>

<p class="pindent">When the proprietor left them, Bond pushed her inside
and closed the door. Then he put his hands on her shoulders
and kissed her on both cheeks.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘This is heaven,’ he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he saw that her eyes were shining. Her hands
came up and rested on his forearms. He stepped right up
against her and his arms dropped round her waist. Her
head went back and her mouth opened beneath his.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My darling,’ he said. He plunged his mouth down on to
hers, forcing her teeth apart with his tongue and feeling
her own tongue working at first shyly then more passionately.
He slipped his hands down to her swelling buttocks
and gripped them fiercely, pressing the centres of their
bodies together. Panting, she slipped her mouth away
from his and they clung together while he rubbed his cheek
against hers and felt her hard breasts pressing into him.
Then he reached up and seized her hair and bent her head
back until he could kiss her again. She pushed him away
and sank back exhausted on to the bed. For a moment
they looked at each other hungrily.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m sorry, Vesper,’ he said. ‘I didn’t mean to then.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She shook her head, dumb with the storm which had
passed through her.</p>

<p class="pindent">He came and sat beside her and they looked at each other
with lingering tenderness as the tide of passion ebbed in
their veins.</p>

<p class="pindent">She leant over and kissed him on the corner of the mouth,
then she brushed the black comma of hair back from his
damp forehead.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My darling,’ she said. ‘Give me a cigarette. I don’t know
where my bag is.’ She looked vaguely round the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond lit one for her and put it between her lips. She
took a deep lungful of smoke and let it pour out through
her mouth with a slow sigh.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond put his arm round her, but she got up and walked
over to the window. She stood there with her back to him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked down at his hands and saw they were still
trembling.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s going to take some time to get ready for dinner,’
said Vesper still not looking at him. ‘Why don’t you go
and bathe? I’ll unpack for you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond left the bed and came and stood close against her.
He put his arms round her and put a hand over each breast.
They filled his hands and the nipples were hard against
his fingers. She put her hands over his and pressed them
into her, but still she looked away from him out of the
window.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Not now,’ she said in a low voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond bent and burrowed his lips into the nape of her
neck. For a moment he strained her hard to him, then he
let her go.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right, Vesper,’ he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">He walked over to the door and looked back. She had
not moved. For some reason he thought she was crying.
He took a step towards her and then realized that there was
nothing to say between them then.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My love,’ he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he went out and shut the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked along to his room and sat down on the bed.</p>

<p class="pindent">He felt weak from the passion which had swept through
his body. He was torn between the desire to fall back full-length
on the bed and his longing to be cooled and revived
by the sea. He played with the choice for a moment, then
he went over to his suitcase and took out white linen
bathing-drawers and a dark blue pyjama-suit.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had always disliked pyjamas and had slept naked
until in Hong Kong at the end of the war he came across
the perfect compromise. This was a pyjama-coat which
came almost down to the knees. It had no buttons, but
there was a loose belt round the waist. The sleeves were
wide and short, ending just above the elbow. The result
was cool and comfortable and now when he slipped the
coat on over his trunks, all his bruises and scars were hidden
except the thin white bracelets on wrists and ankles and the
mark of <span class="sc">smersh</span> on his right hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">He slipped his feet into a pair of dark-blue leather sandals
and went downstairs and out of the house and across the
terrace to the beach. As he passed across the front of the
house he thought of Vesper, but he refrained from looking
up to see if she was still standing at the window. If she
saw him, she gave no sign.</p>

<p class="pindent">He walked along the waterline on the hard golden sand
until he was out of sight of the inn. Then he threw off his
pyjama-coat and took a short run and a quick flat dive into
the small waves. The beach shelved quickly and he kept
underwater as long as he could, swimming with powerful
strokes and feeling the soft coolness all over him. Then he
surfaced and brushed the hair out of his eyes. It was nearly
seven and the sun had lost much of its heat. Before long it
would sink beneath the further arm of the bay, but now it
was straight in his eyes and he turned on his back and
swam away from it so that he could keep it with him as
long as possible.</p>

<p class="pindent">When he came ashore nearly a mile down the bay the
shadows had already engulfed his distant pyjamas but he
knew he had time to lie on the hard sand and dry before
the tide of dusk reached him.</p>

<p class="pindent">He took off his bathing-trunks and looked down at his
body. There were only a few traces left of his injuries. He
shrugged his shoulders and lay down with his limbs spread
out in a star and gazed up at the empty blue sky and thought
of Vesper.</p>

<p class="pindent">His feelings for her were confused and he was impatient
with the confusion. They had been so simple. He had
intended to sleep with her as soon as he could, because he
desired her and also because, and he admitted it to himself,
he wanted coldly to put the repairs to his body to the final
test. He thought they would sleep together for a few days
and then he might see something of her in London. Then
would come the inevitable disengagement which would be
all the easier because of their positions in the Service. If
it was not easy, he could go off on an assignment abroad or,
which was also in his mind, he could resign and travel to
different parts of the world as he had always wanted.</p>

<p class="pindent">But somehow she had crept under his skin and over the
last two weeks his feelings had gradually changed.</p>

<p class="pindent">He found her companionship easy and unexacting. There
was something enigmatic about her which was a constant
stimulus. She gave little of her real personality away and
he felt that however long they were together there would
always be a private room inside her which he could never
invade. She was thoughtful and full of consideration without
being slavish and without compromising her arrogant
spirit. And now he knew that she was profoundly, excitingly
sensual, but that the conquest of her body, because
of the central privacy in her, would each time have the
sweet tang of rape. Loving her physically would each time
be a thrilling voyage without the anticlimax of arrival. She
would surrender herself avidly, he thought, and greedily
enjoy all the intimacies of the bed without ever allowing
herself to be possessed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Naked, Bond lay and tried to push away the conclusions
he read in the sky. He turned his head and looked down
the beach and saw that the shadows of the headland were
almost reaching for him.</p>

<p class="pindent">He stood up and brushed off as much of the sand as he
could reach. He reflected that he would have a bath when
he got in and he absent-mindedly picked up his trunks and
started walking back along the beach. It was only when he
reached his pyjama-coat and bent to pick it up that he
realized he was still naked. Without bothering about
the trunks, he slipped on the light coat and walked on to
the hotel.</p>

<p class="pindent">At that moment his mind was made up.</p>
