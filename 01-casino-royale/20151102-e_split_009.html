<p class="pindent">Bond was determined to be completely fit and relaxed
for a gambling session which might last most of the
night. He ordered a masseur for three o’clock. After the
remains of his luncheon had been removed, he sat at his
window gazing out to sea until there came a knock on the
door as the masseur, a Swede, presented himself.</p>

<p class="pindent">Silently he got to work on Bond from his feet to his neck,
melting the tensions in his body and calming his still
twanging nerves. Even the long purpling bruises down
Bond’s left shoulder and side ceased to throb, and when the
Swede had gone Bond fell into a dreamless sleep.</p>

<p class="pindent">He awoke in the evening completely refreshed.</p>

<p class="pindent">After a cold shower, Bond walked over to the Casino.
Since the night before he had lost the mood of the tables.
He needed to re-establish that focus which is half mathematical
and half intuitive and which, with a slow pulse and
a sanguine temperament, Bond knew to be the essential
equipment of any gambler who was set on winning.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had always been a gambler. He loved the dry riffle
of the cards and the constant unemphatic drama of the
quiet figures round the green tables. He liked the solid,
studied comfort of card-rooms and casinos, the well-padded
arms of the chairs, the glass of champagne or whisky at the
elbow, the quiet unhurried attention of good servants. He
was amused by the impartiality of the roulette ball and of
the playing-cards—and their eternal bias. He liked being
an actor and a spectator and from his chair to take part in
other men’s dramas and decisions, until it came to his own
turn to say that vital ‘yes’ or ‘no’, generally on a fifty-fifty
chance.</p>

<p class="pindent">Above all, he liked it that everything was one’s own
fault. There was only oneself to praise or blame. Luck was
a servant and not a master. Luck had to be accepted with a
shrug or taken advantage of up to the hilt. But it had to be
understood and recognized for what it was and not confused
with a faulty appreciation of the odds, for, at gambling,
the deadly sin is to mistake bad play for bad luck.
And luck in all its moods had to be loved and not feared.
Bond saw luck as a woman, to be softly wooed or brutally
ravaged, never pandered to or pursued. But he was honest
enough to admit that he had never yet been made to suffer
by cards or by women. One day, and he accepted the fact,
he would be brought to his knees by love or by luck. When
that happened he knew that he too would be branded with
the deadly question-mark he recognized so often in others,
the promise to pay before you have lost: the acceptance of
fallibility.</p>

<p class="pindent">But on this June evening when Bond walked through the
‘kitchen’ into the <span class="it">salle privée</span>, it was with a sensation of
confidence and cheerful anticipation that he changed a
million francs into plaques of fifty mille and took a seat next
to the <span class="it">chef de partie</span> at Roulette Table Number 1.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond borrowed the <span class="it">chef</span>’s card and studied the run of
the ball since the session had started at three o’clock that
afternoon. He always did this although he knew that each
turn of the wheel, each fall of the ball into a numbered slot,
has absolutely no connexion with its predecessor. He accepted
that the game begins afresh each time the croupier
picks up the ivory ball with his right hand, gives one of the
four spokes of the wheel a controlled twist clockwise with
the same hand, and with a third motion, also with the right
hand, flicks the ball round the outer rim of the wheel anti-clockwise,
against the spin.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was obvious that all this ritual and all the mechanical
minutiae of the wheel, of the numbered slots and the cylinder,
had been devised and perfected over the years so that
neither the skill of the croupier nor any bias in the wheel
could affect the fall of the ball. And yet it is a convention
among roulette players, and Bond rigidly adhered to it, to
take careful note of the past history of each session and to
be guided by any peculiarities in the run of the wheel. To
note, for instance, and consider significant, sequences of
more than two on a single number or of more than four at
the other chances down to evens.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond didn’t defend the practice. He simply maintained
that the more effort and ingenuity you put into gambling,
the more you took out.</p>

<p class="pindent">On the record of that particular table, after about three
hours’ play, Bond could see little of interest except that the
last dozen had been out of favour. It was his practice to
play always with the wheel, and only to turn against its
previous pattern and start on a new tack after a zero had
turned up. So he decided to play one of his favourite gambits
and back two—in this case the first two—dozens, each
with the maximum—one hundred thousand francs. He thus
had two-thirds of the board covered (less the zero) and,
since the dozens pay odds of two to one, he stood to win a
hundred thousand francs every time any number lower than
twenty-five turned up.</p>

<p class="pindent">After seven coups he had won six times. He lost on
the seventh when thirty came up. His net profit was four
hundred thousand francs. He kept off the table for the
eighth throw. Zero turned up. This piece of luck cheered
him further and, accepting the thirty as a finger-post to
the last dozen, he decided to back the first and last dozens
until he had lost twice. Ten throws later the middle dozen
came up twice, costing him four hundred thousand francs,
but he rose from the table one million francs to the
good.</p>

<p class="pindent">Directly Bond had started playing in maximums, his
game had become the centre of interest at the table. As he
seemed to be in luck, one or two pilot fish started to swim
with the shark. Sitting directly opposite, one of these,
whom Bond took to be an American, had shown more than
the usual friendliness and pleasure at his share of the
winning streak. He had smiled once or twice across the
table, and there was something pointed in the way he
duplicated Bond’s movements, placing his two modest
plaques of ten mille exactly opposite Bond’s larger ones.
When Bond rose, he too pushed back his chair and called
cheerfully across the table:</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thanks for the ride. Guess I owe you a drink. Will you
join me?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had a feeling that this might be the CIA man. He
knew he was right as they strolled off together towards
the bar, after Bond had thrown a plaque of ten mille to the
croupier and had given a mille to the <span class="it">huissier</span> who drew
back his chair.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My name’s Felix Leiter,’ said the American. ‘Glad to
meet you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Mine’s Bond—James Bond.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh yes,’ said his companion, ‘and now let’s see. What
shall we have to celebrate?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond insisted on ordering Leiter’s Haig-and-Haig ‘on
the rocks’ and then he looked carefully at the barman.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A dry martini,’ he said. ‘One. In a deep champagne
goblet.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Oui, monsieur.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Just a moment. Three measures of Gordon’s, one of
vodka, half a measure of Kina Lillet. Shake it very well
until it’s ice-cold, then add a large thin slice of lemon-peel.
Got it?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Certainly, monsieur.’ The barman seemed pleased with
the idea.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Gosh, that’s certainly a drink,’ said Leiter.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed. ‘When I’m . . . er . . . concentrating,’
he explained, ‘I never have more than one drink before
dinner. But I do like that one to be large and very strong
and very cold and very well-made. I hate small portions of
anything, particularly when they taste bad. This drink’s my
own invention. I’m going to patent it when I can think of
a good name.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He watched carefully as the deep glass became frosted
with the pale golden drink, slightly aerated by the bruising
of the shaker. He reached for it and took a long sip.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Excellent,’ he said to the barman, ‘but if you can get a
vodka made with grain instead of potatoes, you will find it
still better.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Mais n’enculons pas des mouches</span>,’ he added in an aside to
the barman. The barman grinned.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That’s a vulgar way of saying “we won’t split hairs”,’
explained Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">But Leiter was still interested in Bond’s drink. ‘You
certainly think things out,’ he said with amusement as they
carried their glasses to a corner of the room. He lowered
his voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You’d better call it the ‘Molotov Cocktail’ after the one
you tasted this afternoon.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They sat down. Bond laughed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I see that the spot marked “X” has been roped off and
they’re making cars take a detour over the pavement. I
hope it hasn’t frightened away any of the big money.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘People are accepting the Communist story or else they
think it was a burst gas-main. All the burnt trees are coming
down tonight and if they work things here like they do at
Monte Carlo, there won’t be a trace of the mess left in the
morning.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter shook a Chesterfield out of his pack. ‘I’m glad
to be working with you on this job,’ he said, looking into
his drink, ‘so I’m particularly glad you didn’t get blown to
glory. Our people are definitely interested. They think it’s
just as important as your friends do and they don’t think
there’s anything crazy about it at all. In fact, Washington’s
pretty sick we’re not running the show, but you know
what the big brass is like. I expect your fellows are much
the same in London.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond nodded. ‘Apt to be a bit jealous of their scoops,’
he admitted.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Anyway, I’m under your orders and I’m to give you any
help you ask for. With Mathis and his boys here, there may
not be much that isn’t taken care of already. But, anyway,
here I am.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m delighted you are,’ said Bond. ‘The opposition
has got me, and probably you and Mathis too, all weighed
up and it seems no holds are going to be barred. I’m glad
Le Chiffre seems as desperate as we thought he was. I’m
afraid I haven’t got anything very specific for you to do,
but I’d be grateful if you’d stick around the Casino this
evening. I’ve got an assistant, a Miss Lynd, and I’d like to
hand her over to you when I start playing. You won’t be
ashamed of her. She’s a good looking girl.’ He smiled at
Leiter. ‘And you might mark his two gunmen. I can’t
imagine he’ll try a rough house, but you never know.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I may be able to help,’ said Leiter. ‘I was a regular in
our Marine Corps before I joined this racket, if that means
anything to you.’ He looked at Bond with a hint of self-deprecation.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It does,’ said Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">It turned out that Leiter was from Texas. While he talked
on about his job with the Joint Intelligence Staff of
NATO and the difficulty of maintaining security in an
organization where so many nationalities were represented,
Bond reflected that good Americans were fine people and
that most of them seemed to come from Texas.</p>

<p class="pindent">Felix Leiter was about thirty-five. He was tall with a
thin bony frame and his lightweight, tan-coloured suit
hung loosely from his shoulders like the clothes of Frank
Sinatra. His movements and speech were slow, but one
had the feeling that there was plenty of speed and strength
in him and that he would be a tough and cruel fighter. As
he sat hunched over the table, he seemed to have some of
the jack-knife quality of a falcon. There was this impression
also in his face, in the sharpness of his chin and cheekbones
and the wide wry mouth. His grey eyes had a feline
slant which was increased by his habit of screwing them up
against the smoke of the Chesterfields which he tapped out
of the pack in a chain. The permanent wrinkles which this
habit had etched at the corners gave the impression that
he smiled more with his eyes than with his mouth. A mop
of straw-coloured hair lent his face a boyish look which
closer examination contradicted. Although he seemed to
talk quite openly about his duties in Paris, Bond soon
noticed that he never spoke of his American colleagues in
Europe or in Washington and he guessed that Leiter held
the interests of his own organization far above the mutual
concerns of the North Atlantic Allies. Bond sympathized
with him.</p>

<p class="pindent">By the time Leiter had swallowed another whisky and
Bond had told him about the Muntzes and his short reconnaissance
trip down the coast that morning, it was seven-thirty,
and they decided to stroll over to their hotel
together. Before leaving the Casino, Bond deposited his
total capital of twenty-four million at the <span class="it">caisse</span>, keeping
only a few notes of ten mille as pocket money.</p>

<p class="pindent">As they walked across to the Splendide, they saw that a
team of workmen was already busy at the scene of the explosion.
Several trees were uprooted and hoses from three
municipal tank cars were washing down the boulevard and
pavements. The bomb-crater had disappeared and only
a few passers-by had paused to gape. Bond assumed that
similar face-lifting had already been carried out at the
Hermitage and to the shops and frontages which had lost
their windows.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the warm blue dusk Royale-les-Eaux was once again
orderly and peaceful.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Who’s the <span class="it">concierge</span> working for?’ asked Leiter as they
approached the hotel. Bond was not sure, and said so.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis had been unable to enlighten him. ‘Unless you
have bought him yourself,’ he had said, ‘you must assume
that he has been bought by the other side. All <span class="it">concierges</span> are
venal. It is not their fault. They are trained to regard all
hotel guests except maharajahs as potential cheats and
thieves. They have as much concern for your comfort or
well-being as crocodiles.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond remembered Mathis’s pronouncement when the
<span class="it">concierge</span> hurried up to inquire whether he had recovered
from his most unfortunate experience of the afternoon.
Bond thought it well to say that he still felt a little shaky.
He hoped that if the intelligence were relayed, Le Chiffre
would at any rate start playing that evening with a basic
misinterpretation of his adversary’s strength. The <span class="it">concierge</span>
proffered glycerine hopes for Bond’s recovery.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter’s room was on one of the upper floors and they
parted company at the lift after arranging to see each other
at the Casino at around half past ten or eleven, the usual
hour for the high tables to begin play.</p>
