<p class="pindent">Head of S (the section of the Secret Service concerned
with the Soviet Union) was so keen on his plan for
the destruction of Le Chiffre, and it was basically his own
plan, that he took the memorandum himself and went up
to the top floor of the gloomy building overlooking Regent’s
Park and through the green baize door and along
the corridor to the end room.</p>

<p class="pindent">He walked belligerently up to M’s Chief of Staff, a young
sapper who had earned his spurs as one of the secretariat to
the Chiefs of Staff committee after having been wounded
during a sabotage operation in 1944, and had kept his sense
of humour in spite of both experiences.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now look here, Bill. I want to sell something to the
Chief. Is this a good moment?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What do you think, Penny?’ The Chief of Staff
turned to M’s private secretary who shared the room with
him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Miss Moneypenny would have been desirable but for
eyes which were cool and direct and quizzical.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Should be all right. He won a bit of a victory at the FO
this morning and he’s not got anyone for the next half an
hour.’ She smiled encouragingly at Head of S whom she
liked for himself and for the importance of his section.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, here’s the dope, Bill.’ He handed over the black
folder with the red star which stood for Top Secret. ‘And
for God’s sake look enthusiastic when you give it him. And
tell him I’ll wait here and read a good code-book while he’s
considering it. He may want some more details, and anyway
I want to see you two don’t pester him with anything
else until he’s finished.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right, sir.’ The Chief of Staff pressed a switch and
leant towards the intercom on his desk.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes?’ asked a quiet, flat voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Head of S has an urgent docket for you, sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a pause.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Bring it in,’ said a voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Chief of Staff released the intercom switch and stood up.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thanks, Bill. I’ll be next door,’ said Head of S.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Chief of Staff crossed his office and went through
the double doors leading into M’s room. In a moment he
came out and over the entrance a small blue light burned
the warning that M was not to be disturbed.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">Later, a triumphant Head of S said to his Number Two:
‘We nearly cooked ourselves with that last paragraph. He
said it was subversion and blackmail. He got pretty sharp
about it. Anyway, he approves. Says the idea’s crazy, but
worth trying if the Treasury will play and he thinks they
will. He’s going to tell them it’s a better gamble than the
money we’re putting into deserting Russian colonels who
turn double after a few months’ “asylum” here. And he’s
longing to get at Le Chiffre, and anyway he’s got the right
man and wants to try him out on the job.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Who is it?’ asked Number Two.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘One of the Double O’s—I guess 007. He’s tough and
M thinks there may be trouble with those gunmen of Le
Chiffre’s. He must be pretty good with the cards or he
wouldn’t have sat in the Casino in Monte Carlo for two
months before the war watching that Roumanian team
work their stuff with the invisible ink and the dark glasses.
He and the Deuxième bowled them out in the end and 007
turned in a million francs he had won at shemmy. Good
money in those days.’</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">James Bond’s interview with M had been short.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What about it, Bond?’ asked M when Bond came back
into his room after reading Head of S’s memorandum and
after gazing for ten minutes out of the waiting-room window
at the distant trees in the park.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked across the desk into the shrewd, clear eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s very kind of you, sir, I’d like to do it. But I can’t
promise to win. The odds at baccarat are the best after
<span class="it">trente-et-quarante</span>—evens except for the tiny <span class="it">cagnotte</span>—but
I might get a bad run against me and get cleaned out.
Play’s going to be pretty high—opening’ll go up to half
a million, I should think.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was stopped by the cold eyes. M knew all this
already, knew the odds at baccarat as well as Bond. That
was his job—knowing the odds at everything, and knowing
men, his own and the opposition’s. Bond wished he had
kept quiet about his misgivings.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He can have a bad run too,’ said M. ‘You’ll have plenty
of capital. Up to twenty-five million, the same as him.
We’ll start you on ten and send you another ten when
you’ve had a look round. You can make the extra five
yourself.’ He smiled. ‘Go over a few days before the big
game starts and get your hand in. Have a talk to Q about
rooms and trains, and any equipment you want. The Paymaster
will fix the funds. I’m going to ask the Deuxième to
stand by. It’s their territory and as it is we shall be lucky
if they don’t kick up rough. I’ll try and persuade them to
send Mathis. You seemed to get on well with him in Monte
Carlo on that other Casino job. And I’m going to tell
Washington because of the NATO angle. CIA have got
one or two good men at Fontainebleau with the joint
intelligence chaps there. Anything else?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shook his head. ‘I’d certainly like to have Mathis,
sir.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, we’ll see. Try and bring it off. We’re going to
look pretty foolish if you don’t. And watch out. This
sounds an amusing job, but I don’t think it’s going to be.
Le Chiffre is a good man. Well, best of luck.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thank you, sir,’ said Bond and went to the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Just a minute.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I think I’ll keep you covered, Bond. Two heads are
better than one and you’ll need someone to run your
communications. I’ll think it over. They’ll get in touch
with you at Royale. You needn’t worry. It’ll be someone
good.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond would have preferred to work alone, but one
didn’t argue with M. He left the room hoping that the man
they sent would be loyal to him and neither stupid, nor,
worse still, ambitious.</p>
