<p class="pindent">While telling the story of the game and anticipating
the coming fight, Bond’s face had lit up again.
The prospect of at least getting to grips with Le Chiffre
stimulated him and quickened his pulse. He seemed to have
completely forgotten the brief coolness between them, and
Vesper was relieved and entered into his mood.</p>

<p class="pindent">He paid the bill and gave a handsome tip to the <span class="it">sommelier</span>.
Vesper rose and led the way out of the restaurant
and out on to the steps of the hotel.</p>

<p class="pindent">The big Bentley was waiting and Bond drove Vesper
over, parking as close to the entrance as he could. As they
walked through the ornate ante-rooms, he hardly spoke. She
looked at him and saw that his nostrils were slightly flared.
In other respects he seemed completely at ease, acknowledging
cheerfully the greetings of the Casino functionaries.
At the door to the <span class="it">salle privée</span> they were not asked for
their membership cards. Bond’s high gambling had already
made him a favoured client and any companion of his shared
in the glory.</p>

<p class="pindent">Before they had penetrated very far into the main room,
Felix Leiter detached himself from one of the roulette tables
and greeted Bond as an old friend. After being introduced
to Vesper Lynd and exchanging a few remarks, Leiter
said: ‘Well, since you’re playing baccarat this evening, will
you allow me to show Miss Lynd how to break the bank at
roulette? I’ve got three lucky numbers that are bound to
show soon, and I expect Miss Lynd has some too. Then
perhaps we could come and watch you when your game
starts to warm up.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked inquiringly at Vesper.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I should love that,’ she said, ‘but will you give me one
of your lucky numbers to play on?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I have no lucky numbers,’ said Bond unsmilingly. ‘I
only bet on even chances, or as near them as I can
get. Well, I shall leave you then.’ He excused himself.
‘You will be in excellent hands with my friend Felix
Leiter.’ He gave a short smile which embraced them
both and walked with an unhurried gait towards the
<span class="it">caisse</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">Leiter sensed the rebuff.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He’s a very serious gambler, Miss Lynd,’ he said. ‘And
I guess he has to be. Now come with me and watch
Number 17 obey my extra-sensory perceptions. You’ll
find it quite a painless sensation being given plenty of
money for nothing.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was relieved to be on his own again and to be able
to clear his mind of everything but the task on hand. He
stood at the <span class="it">caisse</span> and took his twenty-four million francs
against the receipt which had been given him that afternoon.
He divided the notes into equal packets and put half
the sum into his right-hand coat pocket and the other half
into the left. Then he strolled slowly across the room between
the thronged tables until he came to the top of the
room where the broad baccarat table waited behind the
brass rail.</p>

<p class="pindent">The table was filling up and the cards were spread face
down being stirred and mixed slowly in what is known as
the ‘croupiers’ shuffle’, supposedly the shuffle which is most
effective and least susceptible to cheating.</p>

<p class="pindent">The <span class="it">chef de partie</span> lifted the velvet-covered chain which
allowed entrance through the brass rail.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’ve kept Number 6 as you wished, Monsieur Bond.’</p>

<p class="pindent">There were still three other empty places at the table.
Bond moved inside the rail to where a <span class="it">huissier</span> was holding
out his chair. He sat down with a nod to the players on his
right and left. He took out his wide gunmetal cigarette-case
and his black lighter and placed them on the green
baize at his right elbow. The <span class="it">huissier</span> wiped a thick glass
ash-tray with a cloth and put it beside them. Bond lit a
cigarette and leant back in his chair.</p>

<p class="pindent">Opposite him, the banker’s chair was vacant. He glanced
round the table. He knew most of the players by sight, but
few of their names. At Number 7, on his right, there was a
Monsieur Sixte, a wealthy Belgian with metal interests in
the Congo. At Number 9 there was Lord Danvers, a distinguished
but weak-looking man whose francs were
presumably provided by his rich American wife, a middle-aged
woman with the predatory mouth of a barracuda,
who sat at Number 3. Bond reflected that they would
probably play a pawky and nervous game and be amongst
the early casualties. At Number 1, to the right of the bank
was a well-known Greek gambler who owned, as in Bond’s
experience apparently everyone does in the Eastern Mediterranean,
a profitable shipping line. He would play coldly
and well and would be a stayer.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond asked the <span class="it">huissier</span> for a card and wrote on it, under
a neat question mark, the remaining numbers, 2, 4, 5, 8, 10,
and asked the <span class="it">huissier</span> to give it to the <span class="it">chef de partie</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">Soon it came back with the names filled in.</p>

<p class="pindent">Number 2, still empty, was to be Carmel Delane, the
American film star with alimony from three husbands to
burn and, Bond assumed, a call on still more from whoever
her present companion at Royale might be. With her
sanguine temperament she would play gaily and with
panache and might run into a vein of luck.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then came Lady Danvers at Number 3 and Numbers 4
and 5 were a Mr and Mrs Du Pont, rich-looking and might
or might not have some of the real Du Pont money behind
them. Bond guessed they would be stayers. They both
had a business-like look about them and were talking together
easily and cheerfully as if they felt very much at
home at the big game. Bond was quite happy to have them
next to him—Mrs Du Pont sat at Number 5—and he felt
prepared to share with them or with Monsieur Sixte on his
right, if they found themselves faced with too big a bank.</p>

<p class="pindent">At Number 8 was the Maharajah of a small Indian state,
probably with all his wartime sterling balances to play with.
Bond’s experience told him that few of the Asiatic races
were courageous gamblers, even the much-vaunted Chinese
being inclined to lose heart if the going was bad. But
the Maharajah would probably stay in the game and stand
some heavy losses if they were gradual.</p>

<p class="pindent">Number 10 was a prosperous-looking young Italian, Signor
Tomelli, who possibly had plenty of money from
rackrents in Milan and would probably play a dashing and
foolish game. He might lose his temper and make a scene.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had just finished his sketchy summing-up of the
players when Le Chiffre, with the silence and economy of
movement of a big fish, came through the opening in the
brass rail and, with a cold smile of welcome for the table,
took his place directly opposite Bond in the banker’s chair.</p>

<p class="pindent">With the same economy of movement, he cut the thick
slab of cards which the croupier had placed on the table
squarely between his blunt relaxed hands. Then, as the
croupier fitted the six packs with one swift exact motion
into the metal and wooden shoe, Le Chiffre said something
quietly to him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Messieurs, mesdames, les jeux sont faits. Un banco de cinq
cent mille</span>’ and as the Greek at Number 1 tapped the table
in front of his fat pile of hundred-mille plaques, ‘<span class="it">Le banco
est fait</span>.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre crouched over the shoe. He gave it a short
deliberate slap to settle the cards, the first of which showed
its semicircular pale pink tongue through the slanting
aluminium mouth of the shoe. Then, with a thick white
fore-finger he pressed gently on the pink tongue and
slipped out the first card six inches or a foot towards the
Greek on his right hand. Then he slipped out a card for
himself, then another for the Greek, then one more for
himself.</p>

<p class="pindent">He sat immobile, not touching his own cards.</p>

<p class="pindent">He looked at the Greek’s face.</p>

<p class="pindent">With his flat wooden spatula, like a long bricklayer’s
trowel, the croupier delicately lifted up the Greek’s two
cards and dropped them with a quick movement an extra
few inches to the right so that they lay just before the
Greek’s pale hairy hands which lay inert like two watchful
pink crabs on the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">The two pink crabs scuttled out together and the Greek
gathered the cards into his wide left hand and cautiously
bent his head so that he could see, in the shadow made by
his cupped hand, the value of the bottom of the two cards.
Then he slowly inserted the forefinger of his right hand and
slipped the bottom card slightly sideways so that the value
of the top card was also just perceptible.</p>

<p class="pindent">His face was quite impassive. He flattened out his left
hand on the table and then withdrew it, leaving the two
pink cards face down before him, their secret unrevealed.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he lifted his head and looked Le Chiffre in the eye.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Non</span>,’ said the Greek flatly.</p>

<p class="pindent">From the decision to stand on his two cards and not ask
for another, it was clear that the Greek had a five, or a six,
or a seven. To be certain of winning, the banker had to
reveal an eight or a nine. If the banker failed to show
either figure, he also had the right to take another card
which might or might not improve his count.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre’s hands were clasped in front of him, his two
cards three or four inches away. With his right hand he
picked up the two cards and turned them face upwards on
the table with a faint snap.</p>

<p class="pindent">They were a four and a five, an undefeatable natural nine.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had won.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Neuf à la banque</span>,’ quietly said the croupier. With his
spatula he faced the Greek’s two cards, ‘<span class="it">Et le sept</span>,’ he said
unemotionally, lifting up gently the corpses of the seven
and queen and slipping them through the wide slot in the
table near his chair which leads into the gib metal canister
to which all dead cards are consigned. Le Chiffre’s two
cards followed them with a faint rattle which comes from
the canister at the beginning of each session before the
discards have made a cushion over the metal floor of their
oubliette.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Greek pushed forward five plaques of one hundred
thousand and the croupier added these to Le Chiffre’s
half-million plaque which lay in the centre of the table.
From each bet the Casino takes a tiny percentage, the
<span class="it">cagnotte</span>, but it is usual at a big game for the banker to
subscribe this himself either in a prearranged lump or by
contributions at the end of each hand, so that the amount
of the bank’s stake can always be a round figure. Le Chiffre
had chosen the second course.</p>

<p class="pindent">The croupier slipped some counters through the slot in
the table which receives the <span class="it">cagnotte</span> and announced quietly:</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Un banco d’un million</span>.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Suivi</span>,’ murmured the Greek, meaning that he exercised
his right to follow up his lost bet.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond lit a cigarette and settled himself in his chair. The
long game was launched and the sequence of these gestures
and the reiteration of this subdued litany would continue
until the end came and the players dispersed. Then the
enigmatic cards would be burnt or defaced, a shroud would
be draped over the table and the grass-green baize battlefield
would soak up the blood of its victims and refresh
itself.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Greek, after taking a third card, could achieve no
better than a four to the bank’s seven.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Un banco de deux millions</span>,’ said the croupier.</p>

<p class="pindent">The players on Bond’s left remained silent.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Banco</span>,’ said Bond.</p>
