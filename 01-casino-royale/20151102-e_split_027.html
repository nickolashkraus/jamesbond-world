<p class="pindent">As he walked quietly from the terrace into the half-darkness
of the still shuttered dining-room, he was
surprised to see Vesper emerge from the glass-fronted
telephone booth near the front door and softly turn up the
stairs towards their rooms.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Vesper,’ he called, thinking she must have had some
urgent message which might concern them both.</p>

<p class="pindent">She turned quickly, a hand up to her mouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">For a moment longer than necessary she stared at him,
her eyes wide.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What is it, darling?’ he asked, vaguely troubled and
fearing some crisis in their lives.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh,’ she said breathlessly, ‘you made me jump. It
was only . . . I was just telephoning to Mathis. To Mathis,’
she repeated. ‘I wondered if he could get me another
frock. You know, from that girl-friend I told you about.
The <span class="it">vendeuse</span>. You see,’ she talked quickly, her words
coming out in a persuasive jumble, ‘I’ve really got nothing
to wear. I thought I’d catch him at home before he went to
the office. I don’t know my friend’s telephone number and
I thought it would be a surprise for you. I didn’t want
you to hear me moving and wake you up. Is the water
nice? Have you bathed? You ought to have waited for
me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s wonderful,’ said Bond, deciding to relieve her mind,
though irritated with her obvious guilt over this childish
mystery. ‘You must go in and we’ll have breakfast on the
terrace. I’m ravenous. I’m sorry I made you jump. I was
just startled to see anyone about at this hour of the morning.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He put his arm round her, but she disengaged herself,
and moved quickly on up the stairs.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It was such a surprise to see you,’ she said, trying to
cover the incident up with a light touch. ‘You looked like
a ghost, a drowned man, with the hair down over your eyes
like that.’ She laughed harshly. Hearing the harshness,
she turned the laugh into a cough.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I hope I haven’t caught cold,’ she said.</p>

<p class="pindent">She kept on patching up the edifice of her deceit until
Bond wanted to spank her and tell her to relax and tell the
truth. Instead he just gave her a reassuring pat on the back
outside her room and told her to hurry up and have her
bathe.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he went on to his room.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">That was the end of the integrity of their love. The succeeding
days were a shambles of falseness and hypocrisy,
mingled with her tears and moments of animal passion to
which she abandoned herself with a greed made indecent
by the hollowness of their days.</p>

<p class="pindent">Several times Bond tried to break down the dreadful
walls of mistrust. Again and again he brought up the
subject of the telephone call, but she obstinately bolstered
up her story with embellishments which Bond knew she
had thought out afterwards. She even accused Bond of
thinking she had another lover.</p>

<p class="pindent">These scenes always ended in her bitter tears and in
moments almost of hysteria.</p>

<p class="pindent">Each day the atmosphere became more hateful.</p>

<p class="pindent">It seemed fantastic to Bond that human relationships
could collapse into dust overnight and he searched his
mind again and again for a reason.</p>

<p class="pindent">He felt that Vesper was just as horrified as he was and,
if anything, her misery seemed greater than his. But the
mystery of the telephone conversation which Vesper
angrily, almost fearfully it seemed to Bond, refused to
explain was a shadow which grew darker with other small
mysteries and reticences.</p>

<p class="pindent">Already at luncheon on that day things got worse.</p>

<p class="pindent">After a breakfast which was an effort for both of them,
Vesper said she had a headache and would stay in her room
out of the sun. Bond took a book and walked for miles
down the beach. By the time he returned he had argued to
himself that they would be able to sort the problem out over
lunch.</p>

<p class="pindent">Directly they sat down, he apologized gaily for having
startled her at the telephone booth and then he dismissed
the subject and went on to describe what he had seen on his
walk. But Vesper was distrait and commented only in
monosyllables. She toyed with her food and she avoided
Bond’s eyes and gazed past him with an air of preoccupation.</p>

<p class="pindent">When she had failed once or twice to respond to some
conversational gambit or other, Bond also relapsed into
silence and occupied himself with his own gloomy thoughts.</p>

<p class="pindent">All of a sudden she stiffened. Her fork fell with a clatter
on to the edge of her plate and then noisily off the table on
to the terrace.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked up. She had gone as white as a sheet and
she was looking over his shoulder with terror in her face.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond turned his head and saw that a man had just taken
his place at a table on the opposite side of the terrace, well
away from them. He seemed ordinary enough, perhaps
rather sombrely dressed, but in his first quick glance Bond
put him down as some business-man on his way along the
coast who had just happened on the inn or had picked it
out of the Michelin.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What is it, darling?’ he asked anxiously.</p>

<p class="pindent">Vesper’s eyes never moved from the distant figure.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s the man in the car,’ she said in a stifled voice.
‘The man who was following us. I know it is.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked again over his shoulder. The <span class="it">patron</span> was
discussing the menu with the new customer. It was a
perfectly normal scene. They exchanged smiles over some
item on the menu and apparently agreed that it would suit
for the <span class="it">patron</span> took the card and with, Bond guessed, a final
exchange about the wine, he withdrew.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man seemed to realize that he was being watched.
He looked up and gazed incuriously at them for a moment.
Then he reached for a brief-case on the chair beside him,
extracted a newspaper and started to read it, his elbows
propped up on the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">When the man had turned his face towards them, Bond
noticed that he had a black patch over one eye. It was
not tied with a tape across the eye, but screwed in like a
monocle. Otherwise he seemed a friendly middle-aged
man, with dark brown hair brushed straight back, and, as
Bond had seen while he was talking to the <span class="it">patron</span>,
particularly large, white teeth.</p>

<p class="pindent">He turned back to Vesper. ‘Really, darling. He looks
very innocent. Are you sure he’s the same man? We can’t
expect to have this place entirely to ourselves.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Vesper’s face was still a white mask. She was clutching
the edge of the table with both hands. He thought she was
going to faint and almost rose to come round to her, but she
made a gesture to stop him. Then she reached for a glass
of wine and took a deep draught. The glass rattled on her
teeth and she brought up her other hand to help. Then
she put the glass down.</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked at him with dull eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I know it’s the same.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He tried to reason with her, but she paid no attention.
After glancing once or twice over his shoulder with eyes
that held a curious submissiveness, she said that her headache
was still bad and that she would spend the afternoon
in her room. She left the table and walked indoors without
a backward glance.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond was determined to set her mind at rest. He ordered
coffee to be brought to the table and then he rose and
walked swiftly to the courtyard. The black Peugeot which
stood there might indeed have been the saloon they had
seen, but it might equally have been one of a million others
on the French roads. He took a quick glance inside, but
the interior was empty and when he tried the boot, it was
locked. He made a note of the Paris number-plate then he
went quickly to the lavatory adjoining the dining-room,
pulled the chain and walked out on to the terrace.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man was eating and didn’t look up.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond sat down in Vesper’s chair so that he could watch
the other table.</p>

<p class="pindent">A few minutes later the man asked for the bill, paid it and
left. Bond heard the Peugeot start up and soon the noise
of its exhaust had disappeared in the direction of the road
to Royale.</p>

<p class="pindent">When the <span class="it">patron</span> came back to his table, Bond explained
that Madame had unfortunately a slight touch of sunstroke.
After the <span class="it">patron</span> had expressed his regret and enlarged on the
dangers of going out of doors in almost any weather, Bond
casually asked about the other customer. ‘He reminds me of a
friend who also lost an eye. They wear similar black patches.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The <span class="it">patron</span> answered that the man was a stranger. He
had been pleased with his lunch and had said that he would
be passing that way again in a day or two and would take
another meal at the <span class="it">auberge</span>. Apparently he was Swiss,
which could also be seen from his accent. He was a traveller
in watches. It was shocking to have only one eye. The
strain of keeping that patch in place all day long. He supposed
one got used to it.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It is indeed very sad,’ said Bond. ‘You also have been
unlucky,’ he gestured to the proprietor’s empty sleeve.
‘I myself was very fortunate.’</p>

<p class="pindent">For a time they talked about the war. Then Bond rose.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘By the way,’ he said, ‘Madame had an early telephone call
which I must remember to pay for. Paris. An Elysée number
I think,’ he added, remembering that that was Mathis’s
exchange.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Thank you, monsieur, but the matter is regulated. I
was speaking to Royale this morning and the exchange
mentioned that one of my guests had put through a call to
Paris and that there had been no answer. They wanted to
know if Madame would like the call kept in. I’m afraid
the matter escaped my mind. Perhaps Monsieur would
mention it to Madame. But, let me see, it was an Invalides
number the exchange referred to.’</p>
