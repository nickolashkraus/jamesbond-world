<p class="pindent">It was a large bare room, sparsely furnished in cheap
French <span class="it">art nouveau</span> style. It was difficult to say whether
it was intended as a living- or dining-room for a flimsy-looking
mirrored sideboard, sporting an orange crackle-ware
fruit dish and two painted wooden candlesticks, took
up most of the wall opposite the door and contradicted the
faded pink sofa ranged against the other side of the room.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was no table in the centre under the alabasterine
ceiling light, only a small square of stained carpet with a
futurist design in contrasting browns.</p>

<p class="pindent">Over by the window was an incongruous-looking
throne-like chair in carved oak with a red velvet seat, a low
table on which stood an empty water carafe and two glasses,
and a light arm-chair with a round cane seat and no cushion.</p>

<p class="pindent">Half-closed Venetian blinds obscured the view from the
window, but cast bars of early sunlight over the few pieces
of furniture and over part of the brightly papered wall and
the brown stained floorboards.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre pointed at the cane chair.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That will do excellently,’ he said to the thin man.
‘Prepare him quickly. If he resists, damage him only a
little.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He turned to Bond. There was no expression on his
large face and his round eyes were uninterested. ‘Take
off your clothes. For every effort to resist, Basil will break
one of your fingers. We are serious people and your good
health is of no interest to us. Whether you live or die depends
on the outcome of the talk we are about to have.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He made a gesture towards the thin man and left the
room.</p>

<p class="pindent">The thin man’s first action was a curious one. He opened
the clasp-knife he had used on the hood of Bond’s car, took
the small arm-chair and with a swift motion he cut out its
cane seat.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he came back to Bond, sticking the still open knife,
like a fountain-pen, in the vest pocket of his coat. He
turned Bond round to the light and unwound the flex from
his wrists. Then he stood quickly aside and the knife was
back in his right hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Vite.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stood chafing his swollen wrists and debating with
himself how much time he could waste by resisting. He
only delayed an instant. With a swift step and a downward
sweep of his free hand, the thin man seized the collar
of his dinner-jacket and dragged it down, pinning Bond’s
arms back. Bond made the traditional counter to this old
policeman’s hold by dropping down on one knee, but as he
dropped the thin man dropped with him and at the same
time brought his knife round and down behind Bond’s
back. Bond felt the back of the blade pass down his spine.
There was the hiss of a sharp knife through cloth and his
arms were suddenly free as the two halves of his coat fell
forward.</p>

<p class="pindent">He cursed and stood up. The thin man was back in his
previous position, his knife again at the ready in his relaxed
hand. Bond let the two halves of his dinner-jacket fall off
his arms on to the floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Allez</span>,’ said the thin man with a faint trace of impatience.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked him in the eye and then slowly started to
take off his shirt.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre came quietly back into the room. He carried
a pot of what smelt like coffee. He put it on the small table
near the window. He also placed beside it on the table two
other homely objects, a three-foot-long carpet-beater in
twisted cane and a carving knife.</p>

<p class="pindent">He settled himself comfortably on the throne-like chair
and poured some of the coffee into one of the glasses. With
one foot he hooked forward the small arm-chair, whose
seat was now an empty circular frame of wood, until it was
directly opposite him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond stood stark naked in the middle of the room,
bruises showing livid on his white body, his face a grey
mask of exhaustion and knowledge of what was to come.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Sit down there.’ Le Chiffre nodded at the chair in front
of him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond walked over and sat down.</p>

<p class="pindent">The thin man produced some flex. With this he bound
Bond’s wrists to the arms of the chair and his ankles to the
front legs. He passed a double strand across his chest,
under the arm-pits and through the chair-back. He made
no mistakes with the knots and left no play in any of the
bindings. All of them bit sharply into Bond’s flesh. The
legs of the chair were broadly spaced and Bond could not
even rock it.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was utterly a prisoner, naked and defenceless.</p>

<p class="pindent">His buttocks and the underpart of his body protruded
through the seat of the chair towards the floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre nodded to the thin man who quietly left the
room and closed the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was a packet of Gauloises on the table and a
lighter. Le Chiffre lit a cigarette and swallowed a mouthful
of coffee from the glass. Then he picked up the cane
carpet-beater and, resting the handle comfortably on his
knee, allowed the flat trefoil base to lie on the floor directly
under Bond’s chair.</p>

<p class="pindent">He looked Bond carefully, almost caressingly, in the
eyes. Then his wrists sprang suddenly upwards on his knee.</p>

<p class="pindent">The result was startling.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s whole body arched in an involuntary spasm.
His face contracted in a soundless scream and his lips drew
right away from his teeth. At the same time his head
flew back with a jerk showing the taut sinews of his neck.
For an instant, muscles stood out in knots all over his body
and his toes and fingers clenched until they were quite
white. Then his body sagged and perspiration started to
bead all over his body. He uttered a deep groan.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre waited for his eyes to open.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You see, dear boy?’ He smiled a soft, fat smile. ‘Is the
position quite clear now?’</p>

<p class="pindent">A drop of sweat fell off Bond’s chin on to his naked
chest.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now let us get down to business and see how soon we
can be finished with this unfortunate mess you have got
yourself into.’ He puffed cheerfully at his cigarette and gave
an admonitory tap on the floor beneath Bond’s chair with
his horrible and incongruous instrument.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘My dear boy,’ Le Chiffre spoke like a father, ‘the game
of Red Indians is over, quite over. You have stumbled by
mischance into a game for grown-ups and you have already
found it a painful experience. You are not equipped, my
dear boy, to play games with adults and it was very foolish
of your nanny in London to have sent you out here with
your spade and bucket. Very foolish indeed and most unfortunate
for you.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But we must stop joking, my dear fellow, although I am
sure you would like to follow me in developing this amusing
little cautionary tale.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He suddenly dropped his bantering tone and looked at
Bond sharply and venomously.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Where is the money?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s bloodshot eyes looked emptily back at him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Again the upward jerk of the wrist and again Bond’s
whole body writhed and contorted.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre waited until the tortured heart eased down its
laboured pumping and until Bond’s eyes dully opened
again.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Perhaps I should explain,’ said Le Chiffre. ‘I intend
to continue attacking the sensitive parts of your body until
you answer my question. I am without mercy and there
will be no relenting. There is no one to stage a last-minute
rescue and there is no possibility of escape for you. This is
not a romantic adventure story in which the villain is finally
routed and the hero is given a medal and marries the girl.
Unfortunately these things don’t happen in real life. If
you continue to be obstinate, you will be tortured to the
edge of madness and then the girl will be brought in and
we will set about her in front of you. If that is still not
enough, you will both be painfully killed and I shall
reluctantly leave your bodies and make my way abroad to
a comfortable house which is waiting for me. There I shall
take up a useful and profitable career and live to a ripe and
peaceful old age in the bosom of the family I shall doubtless
create. So you see, my dear boy, that I stand to lose nothing.
If you hand the money over, so much the better. If not, I
shall shrug my shoulders and be on my way.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He paused, and his wrist lifted slightly on his knee.
Bond’s flesh cringed as the cane surface just touched him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘But you, my dear fellow, can only hope that I shall
spare you further pain and spare your life. There is no
other hope for you but that. Absolutely none.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond closed his eyes and waited for the pain. He knew
that the beginning of torture is the worst. There is a parabola
of agony. A crescendo leading up to a peak and then
the nerves are blunted and react progressively less until
unconsciousness and death. All he could do was to pray for
the peak, pray that his spirit would hold out so long and
then accept the long free-wheel down to the final black-out.</p>

<p class="pindent">He had been told by colleagues who had survived torture
by the Germans and the Japanese that towards the end
there came a wonderful period of warmth and languor
leading into a sort of sexual twilight where pain turned to
pleasure and where hatred and fear of the torturers turned
to a masochistic infatuation. It was the supreme test of will,
he had learnt, to avoid showing this form of punch-drunkenness.
Directly it was suspected they would either
kill you at once and save themselves further useless effort,
or let you recover sufficiently so that your nerves had crept
back to the other side of the parabola. Then they would
start again.</p>

<p class="pindent">He opened his eyes a fraction.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre had been waiting for this and like a rattlesnake
the cane instrument leapt from the floor. It struck again
and again so that Bond screamed and his body jangled in
the chair like a marionette.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre desisted only when Bond’s tortured spasms
showed a trace of sluggishness. He sat for a while sipping
his coffee and frowning slightly like a surgeon watching a
cardiograph during a difficult operation.</p>

<p class="pindent">When Bond’s eyes flickered and opened he addressed
him again, but now with a trace of impatience.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We know that the money is somewhere in your
room,’ he said. ‘You drew a cheque to cash for forty
million francs and I know that you went back to the
hotel to hide it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">For a moment Bond wondered how he had been so
certain.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Directly you left for the night club,’ continued Le
Chiffre, ‘your room was searched by four of my
people.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The Muntzes must have helped, reflected Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We found a good deal in childish hiding-places. The
ball-cock in the lavatory yielded an interesting little code-book
and we found some more of your papers taped to the
back of a drawer. All the furniture has been taken to
pieces and your clothes and the curtains and bedclothes
have been cut up. Every inch of the room has been searched
and all the fittings removed. It is most unfortunate for you
that we didn’t find the cheque. If we had, you would now
be comfortably in bed, perhaps with the beautiful Miss
Lynd, instead of this.’ He lashed upwards.</p>

<p class="pindent">Through the red mist of pain, Bond thought of Vesper.
He could imagine how she was being used by the two gunmen.
They would be making the most of her before she
was sent for by Le Chiffre. He thought of the fat wet lips
of the Corsican and the slow cruelty of the thin man. Poor
wretch to have been dragged into this. Poor little beast.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre was talking again.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Torture is a terrible thing,’ he was saying as he puffed
at a fresh cigarette, ‘but it is a simple matter for the torturer,
particularly when the patient,’ he smiled at the word,
‘is a man. You see, my dear Bond, with a man it is quite
unnecessary to indulge in refinements. With this simple
instrument, or with almost any other object, one can cause
a man as much pain as is possible or necessary. Do not
believe what you read in novels or books about the war.
There is nothing worse. It is not only the immediate agony,
but also the thought that your manhood is being gradually
destroyed and that at the end, if you will not yield, you will
no longer be a man.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That, my dear Bond, is a sad and terrible thought—a
long chain of agony for the body and also for the mind, and
then the final screaming moment when you will beg me to
kill you. All that is inevitable unless you tell me where you
hid the money.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He poured some more coffee into the glass and drank it
down leaving brown corners to his mouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s lips were writhing. He was trying to say something.
At last he got the word out in a harsh croak: ‘Drink,’
he said and his tongue came out and swilled across his dry
lips.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course, my dear boy, how thoughtless of me.’ Le
Chiffre poured some coffee into the other glass. There was
a ring of sweat drops on the floor round Bond’s chair.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We must certainly keep your tongue lubricated.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He laid the handle of the carpet-beater down on the floor
between his thick legs and rose from his chair. He went
behind Bond and taking a handful of his soaking hair in one
hand, he wrenched Bond’s head sharply back. He poured
the coffee down Bond’s throat in small mouthfuls so that
he would not choke. Then he released his head so that it
fell forward again on his chest. He went back to his chair
and picked up the carpet-beater.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond raised his head and spoke thickly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Money no good to you.’ His voice was a laborious
croak. ‘Police trace it to you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Exhausted by the effort, his head sank forward again.
He was a little, but only a little, exaggerating the extent of
his physical collapse. Anything to gain time and anything
to defer the next searing pain.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ah, my dear fellow, I had forgotten to tell you.’ Le
Chiffre smiled wolfishly. ‘We met after our little game at
the Casino and you were such a sportsman that you agreed
we would have one more run through the pack between the
two of us. It was a gallant gesture. Typical of an English
gentleman.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Unfortunately you lost and this upset you so much that
you decided to leave Royale immediately for an unknown
destination. Like the gentleman you are, you very kindly
gave me a note explaining the circumstances so that I
would have no difficulty in cashing your cheque. You see,
dear boy, everything has been thought of and you need
have no fears on my account.’ He chuckled fatly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now shall we continue? I have all the time in the world
and truth to tell I am rather interested to see how long a
man can stand this particular form of . . . er . . . encouragement.’
He rattled the harsh cane on the floor.</p>

<p class="pindent">So that was the score, thought Bond, with a final sinking
of the heart. The ‘unknown destination’ would be under
the ground or under the sea, or perhaps, more simply,
under the crashed Bentley. Well, if he had to die anyway, he
might as well try it the hard way. He had no hope that
Mathis or Leiter would get to him in time, but at least there
was a chance that they would catch up with Le Chiffre
before he could get away. It must be getting on for seven.
The car might have been found by now. It was a choice of
evils, but the longer Le Chiffre continued the torture the
more likely he would be revenged.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond lifted his head and looked Le Chiffre in the eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">The china of the whites was now veined with red. It was
like looking at two blackcurrants poached in blood. The
rest of the wide face was yellowish except where a thick
black stubble covered the moist skin. The upward edges
of black coffee at the corners of the mouth gave his expression
a false smile and the whole face was faintly striped
by the light through the Venetian blinds.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No,’ he said flatly, ‘. . . you . . .’</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre grunted and set to work again with savage
fury. Occasionally he snarled like a wild beast.</p>

<p class="pindent">After ten minutes Bond had fainted, blessedly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre at once stopped. He wiped some sweat from
his face with a circular motion of his disengaged hand. Then
he looked at his watch and seemed to make up his mind.</p>

<p class="pindent">He got up and stood behind the inert, dripping body.
There was no colour in Bond’s face or anywhere on his
body above the waist. There was a faint flutter of his skin
above the heart. Otherwise he might have been dead.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre seized Bond’s ears and harshly twisted them.
Then he leant forward and slapped his cheeks hard several
times. Bond’s head rolled from side to side with each blow.
Slowly his breathing became deeper. An animal groan
came from his lolling mouth.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre took a glass of coffee and poured some into
Bond’s mouth and threw the rest in his face. Bond’s eyes
slowly opened.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre returned to his chair and waited. He lit a
cigarette and contemplated the spattered pool of blood on
the floor beneath the inert body opposite.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond groaned again pitifully. It was an inhuman sound.
His eyes opened and he gazed dully at his torturer.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre spoke.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That is all, Bond. We will now finish with you. You
understand? Not kill you, but finish with you. And then
we will have in the girl and see if something can be got out
of the remains of the two of you.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He reached towards the table.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Say good-bye to it, Bond.’</p>
