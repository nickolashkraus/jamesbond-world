<p class="pindent">When Bond left the bar he walked purposefully along
the pavement flanking the tree-lined boulevard towards
his hotel a few hundred yards away. He was
hungry.</p>

<p class="pindent">The day was still beautiful, but by now the sun was very
hot and the plane-trees, spaced about twenty feet apart on
the grass verge between the pavement and the broad tarmac,
gave a cool shade.</p>

<p class="pindent">There were few people abroad and the two men standing
quietly under a tree on the opposite side of the boulevard
looked out of place.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond noticed them when he was still a hundred yards
away and when the same distance separated them from the
ornamental <span class="it">porte cochère</span> of the Splendide.</p>

<p class="pindent">There was something rather disquieting about their
appearance. They were both small and they were dressed
alike in dark and, Bond reflected, rather hot-looking suits.
They had the appearance of a variety turn waiting for a
bus on the way to the theatre. Each wore a straw hat with a
thick black ribbon as a concession, perhaps, to the holiday
atmosphere of the resort, and the brims of these and the
shadow from the tree under which they stood obscured
their faces. Incongruously, each dark, squat little figure was
illuminated by a touch of bright colour. They were both
carrying square camera-cases slung from the shoulder.</p>

<p class="pindent">And one case was bright red and the other case bright
blue.</p>

<p class="pindent">By the time Bond had taken in these details, he had come
to within fifty yards of the two men. He was reflecting on
the ranges of various types of weapon and the possibilities
of cover when an extraordinary and terrible scene was
enacted.</p>

<p class="pindent">Red-man seemed to give a short nod to Blue-man. With
a quick movement Blue-man unslung his blue camera-case.
Blue-man, and Bond could not see exactly as the
trunk of a plane-tree beside him just then intervened to
obscure his vision, bent forward and seemed to fiddle with
the case. Then with a blinding flash of white light there
was the ear-splitting crack of a monstrous explosion and
Bond, despite the protection of the tree-trunk, was slammed
down to the pavement by a bolt of hot air which dented
his cheeks and stomach as if they had been made of paper.
He lay, gazing up at the sun, while the air (or so it seemed
to him) went on twanging with the explosion as if someone
had hit the bass register of a piano with a sledgehammer.</p>

<p class="pindent">When, dazed and half-conscious, he raised himself on
one knee, a ghastly rain of pieces of flesh and shreds of
blood-soaked clothing fell on him and around him, mingled
with branches and gravel. Then a shower of small twigs and
leaves. From all sides came the sharp tinkle of falling glass.
Above in the sky hung a mushroom of black smoke which
rose and dissolved as he drunkenly watched it. There was
an obscene smell of high explosive, of burning wood, and
of, yes, that was it—roast mutton. For fifty yards down the
boulevard the trees were leafless and charred. Opposite,
two of them had snapped off near the base and lay drunkenly
across the road. Between them there was a still
smoking crater. Of the two men in straw hats, there
remained absolutely nothing. But there were red traces on
the road, and on the pavements and against the trunks of
the trees, and there were glittering shreds high up in the
branches.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond felt himself starting to vomit.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was Mathis who got to him first, and by that time
Bond was standing with his arm round the tree which had
saved his life.</p>

<p class="pindent">Stupefied, but unharmed, he allowed Mathis to lead him
off towards the Splendide from which guests and servants
were pouring in chattering fright. As the distant clang of
bells heralded the arrival of ambulances and fire-engines,
they managed to push through the throng and up the short
stairs and along the corridor to Bond’s room.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis paused only to turn on the radio in front of the
fireplace, then, while Bond stripped off his blood-flecked
clothes, Mathis sprayed him with questions.</p>

<p class="pindent">When it came to the description of the two men, Mathis
tore the telephone off its hook beside Bond’s bed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘. . . and tell the police,’ he concluded, ‘tell them that
the Englishman from Jamaica who was knocked over by
the blast is my affair. He is unhurt and they are not to
worry him. I will explain to them in half an hour. They
should tell the Press that it was apparently a vendetta between
two Bulgarian Communists and that one killed the
other with a bomb. They need say nothing of the third
Bulgar who must have been hanging about somewhere, but
they must get him at all costs. He will certainly head for
Paris. Road-blocks everywhere. Understand? <span class="it">Alors, bonne
chance.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis turned back to Bond and heard him to the end.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Merde</span>, but you were lucky,’ he said when Bond had
finished. ‘Clearly the bomb was intended for you. It must
have been faulty. They intended to throw it and then dodge
behind their tree. But it all came out the other way round.
Never mind. We will discover the facts.’ He paused. ‘But
certainly it is a curious affair. And these people appear to
be taking you seriously.’ Mathis looked affronted. ‘But
how did these <span class="it">sacré</span> Bulgars intend to escape capture? And
what was the significance of the red and the blue cases? We
must try and find some fragments of the red one.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis bit his nails. He was excited and his eyes glittered.
This was becoming a formidable and dramatic affair, in
many aspects of which he was now involved personally.
Certainly it was no longer just a case of holding Bond’s
coat while he had his private battle with Le Chiffre in the
Casino. Mathis jumped up.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now get a drink and some lunch and a rest,’ he ordered
Bond. ‘For me, I must get my nose quickly into this affair
before the police have muddied the trail with their big
black boots.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis turned off the radio and waved an affectionate
farewell. The door slammed and silence settled on the
room. Bond sat for a while by the window and enjoyed
being alive.</p>

<p class="pindent">Later, as Bond was finishing his first straight whisky ‘on
the rocks’ and was contemplating the <span class="it">paté de foie gras</span> and
cold <span class="it">langouste</span> which the waiter had just laid out for him,
the telephone rang.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘This is Mademoiselle Lynd.’</p>

<p class="pindent">The voice was low and anxious.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Are you all right?’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Yes, quite.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I’m glad. Please take care of yourself.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She rang off.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shook himself, then he picked up his knife and
selected the thickest of the pieces of hot toast.</p>

<p class="pindent">He suddenly thought: two of them are dead, and I have
got one more on my side. It’s a start.</p>

<p class="pindent">He dipped the knife into the glass of very hot water
which stood beside the pot of Strasbourg porcelain and
reminded himself to tip the waiter doubly for this particular
meal.</p>
