<p class="pindent">It was the crudest possible forgery.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond leapt for the Bentley, blessing the impulse which
had made him drive it over after dinner. With the choke
full out, the engine answered at once to the starter and the
roar drowned the faltering words of the commissionaire
who jumped aside as the rear wheels whipped gravel at his
piped trouser-legs.</p>

<p class="pindent">As the car rocked to the left outside the gate, Bond ruefully
longed for the front-wheel drive and low chassis of the
Citroën. Then he went fast through the gears and settled
himself for the pursuit, briefly savouring the echo of the
huge exhaust as it came back at him from either side of the
short main street through the town.</p>

<p class="pindent">Soon he was out on the coast road, a broad highway
through the sand-dunes which he knew from his morning’s
drive had an excellent surface and was well cat’s-eyed on
the bends. He pushed the revs up and up, hurrying the
car to eighty then to ninety, his huge Marchal headlights
boring a safe white tunnel, nearly half a mile long, between
the walls of the night.</p>

<p class="pindent">He knew the Citroën must have come this way. He had
heard the exhaust penetrate beyond the town, and a little
dust still hung on the bends. He hoped soon to see the
distant shaft of its headlights. The night was still and clear.
Only out at sea there must be a light summer mist for at
intervals he could hear the fog-horns lowing like iron cattle
down the coast.</p>

<p class="pindent">As he drove, whipping the car faster and faster through
the night, with the other half of his mind he cursed Vesper,
and M for having sent her on the job.</p>

<p class="pindent">This was just what he had been afraid of. These blithering
women who thought they could do a man’s work.
Why the hell couldn’t they stay at home and mind their
pots and pans and stick to their frocks and gossip and leave
men’s work to the men. And now for this to happen to him,
just when the job had come off so beautifully. For Vesper
to fall for an old trick like that and get herself snatched and
probably held to ransom like some bloody heroine in a strip
cartoon. The silly bitch.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond boiled at the thought of the fix he was in.</p>

<p class="pindent">Of course. The idea was a straight swop. The girl against
his cheque for forty million. Well, he wouldn’t play:
wouldn’t think of playing. She was in the Service and knew
what she was up against. He wouldn’t even ask M. This
job was more important than her. It was just too bad. She
was a fine girl, but he wasn’t going to fall for this childish
trick. No dice. He would try and catch the Citroën and
shoot it out with them and if she got shot in the process,
that was too bad too. He would have done his stuff—tried
to rescue her before they got her off to some hideout—but
if he didn’t catch up with them he would get back to his
hotel and go to sleep and say no more about it. The next
morning he would ask Mathis what had happened to her
and show him the note. If Le Chiffre put the touch on
Bond for the money in exchange for the girl, Bond would
do nothing and tell no one. The girl would just have to
take it. If the commissionaire came along with the story
of what he had seen, Bond would bluff it out by saying he
had had a drunken row with the girl.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond’s mind raged furiously on with the problem as he
flung the great car down the coast road, automatically
taking the curves and watching out for carts or cyclists on
their way into Royale. On straight stretches the Amherst
Villiers supercharger dug spurs into the Bentley’s twenty-five
horses and the engine sent a high-pitched scream of
pain into the night. Then the revolutions mounted until he
was past 110 and on to the 120 mph mark on the speedometer.</p>

<p class="pindent">He knew he must be gaining fast. Loaded as she was the
Citroën could hardly better eighty even on this road. On
an impulse he slowed down to seventy, turned on his fog-lights,
and dowsed the twin Marchals. Sure enough, without
the blinding curtain of his own lights, he could see the
glow of another car a mile or two down the coast.</p>

<p class="pindent">He felt under the dashboard and from a concealed holster
took out a long-barrelled Colt Army Special ·45 and laid it
on the seat beside him. With this, if he was lucky with the
surface of the road, he could hope to get their tyres or their
petrol tank at anything up to a hundred yards.</p>

<p class="pindent">Then he switched on the big lights again and screamed
off in pursuit. He felt calm and at ease. The problem of
Vesper’s life was a problem no longer. His face in the blue
light from the dashboard was grim but serene.</p>

<hr class="tbk"/>

<p class="pindent">Ahead in the Citroën there were three men and the girl.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre was driving, his big fluid body hunched
forward, his hands light and delicate on the wheel. Beside
him sat the squat man who had carried the stick in the
Casino. In his left hand he grasped a thick lever which
protruded beside him almost level with the floor. It might
have been a lever to adjust the driving seat.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the back seat was the tall thin gunman. He lay back
relaxed, gazing at the ceiling, apparently uninterested in
the wild speed of the car. His right hand lay caressingly on
Vesper’s left thigh which stretched out naked beside him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Apart from her legs, which were naked to the hips,
Vesper was only a parcel. Her long black velvet skirt had
been lifted over her arms and head and tied above her head
with a piece of rope. Where her face was, a small gap had
been torn in the velvet so that she could breathe. She was
not bound in any other way and she lay quiet, her body
moving sluggishly with the swaying of the car.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre was concentrating half on the road ahead and
half on the onrushing glare of Bond’s headlights in the
driving-mirror. He seemed undisturbed when not more
than a mile separated the hare from the hounds and he even
brought the car down from eighty to sixty miles an hour.
Now, as he swept round a bend he slowed down still further.
A few hundred yards ahead a Michelin post showed
where a small parochial road crossed with the highway.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Attention</span>,’ he said sharply to the man beside him.</p>

<p class="pindent">The man’s hand tightened on the lever.</p>

<p class="pindent">A hundred yards from the cross-roads he slowed to
thirty. In the mirror Bond’s great headlights were lighting
up the bend.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre seemed to make up his mind.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Allez.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">The man beside him pulled the lever sharply upwards.
The boot at the back of the car yawned open like a whale’s
mouth. There was a tinkling clatter on the road and then
a rhythmic jangling as if the car was towing lengths of
chain behind it.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Coupez.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">The man depressed the lever sharply and the jangling
stopped with a final clatter.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre glanced again in the mirror. Bond’s car was
just entering the bend. Le Chiffre made a racing change
and threw the Citroën left-handed down the narrow side-road,
at the same time dowsing his lights.</p>

<p class="pindent">He stopped the car with a jerk and all three men got
swiftly out and doubled back under cover of a low hedge to
the cross-roads, now fiercely illuminated by the lights of
the Bentley. Each of them carried a revolver and the thin
man also had what looked like a large black egg in his right
hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Bentley screamed down towards them like an
express train.</p>
