<p class="pindent">The scent and smoke and sweat of a casino are nauseating
at three in the morning. Then the soul-erosion
produced by high gambling—a compost of greed and fear
and nervous tension—becomes unbearable and the senses
awake and revolt from it.</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond suddenly knew that he was tired. He
always knew when his body or his mind had had enough
and he always acted on the knowledge. This helped him to
avoid staleness and the sensual bluntness that breeds mistakes.</p>

<p class="pindent">He shifted himself unobtrusively away from the roulette
he had been playing and went to stand for a moment at the
brass rail which surrounded breast-high the top table in the
<span class="it">salle privée</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">Le Chiffre was still playing and still, apparently, winning.
There was an untidy pile of flecked hundred-mille
plaques in front of him. In the shadow of his thick left
arm there nestled a discreet stack of the big yellow ones
worth half a million francs each.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond watched the curious, impressive profile for a time,
and then he shrugged his shoulders to lighten his thoughts
and moved away.</p>

<p class="pindent">The barrier surrounding the <span class="it">caisse</span> comes as high as your
chin and the <span class="it">caissier</span>, who is generally nothing more than a
minor bank clerk, sits on a stool and dips into his piles of
notes and plaques. These are ranged on shelves. They are
on a level, behind the protecting barrier, with your groin.
The <span class="it">caissier</span> has a cosh and a gun to protect him, and to heave
over the barrier and steal some notes and then vault back and
get out of the casino through the passages and doors would
be impossible. And the <span class="it">caissiers</span> generally work in pairs.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond reflected on the problem as he collected the sheaf of
hundred thousand and then the sheaves of ten thousand
franc notes. With another part of his mind, he had a vision
of tomorrow’s regular morning meeting of the casino committee.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Monsieur Le Chiffre made two million. He played his
usual game. Miss Fairchild made a million in an hour and
then left. She executed three “bancos” of Monsieur Le
Chiffre within an hour and then left. She played with
coolness. Monsieur le Vicomte de Villorin made one million
two at roulette. He was playing the maximum on the first
and last dozens. He was lucky. Then the Englishman,
Mister Bond, increased his winnings to exactly three
million over the two days. He was playing a progressive
system on red at table five. Duclos, the <span class="it">chef de partie</span>, has
the details. It seems that he is persevering and plays in
maximums. He has luck. His nerves seem good. On the
<span class="it">soirée</span>, the chemin-de-fer won <span class="it">x</span>, the baccarat won <span class="it">y</span> and
the roulette won <span class="it">z</span>. The boule, which was again badly
frequented, still makes its expenses.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Merci, Monsieur Xavier.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘<span class="it">Merci, Monsieur le Président.</span>’</p>

<p class="pindent">Or something like that, thought Bond as he pushed his
way through the swing doors of the <span class="it">salle privée</span> and nodded
to the bored man in evening clothes whose job it is to bar
your entry and your exit with the electric foot-switch
which can lock the doors at any hint of trouble.</p>

<p class="pindent">And the casino committee would balance its books and
break up to its homes or cafés for lunch.</p>

<p class="pindent">As for robbing the <span class="it">caisse</span>, in which Bond himself was not
personally concerned, but only interested, he reflected that
it would take ten good men, that they would certainly have
to kill one or two employees, and that anyway you
probably couldn’t find ten non-squeal killers in France, or
in any other country for the matter of that.</p>

<p class="pindent">As he gave a thousand francs to the <span class="it">vestiaire</span> and walked
down the steps of the casino, Bond made up his mind that
Le Chiffre would in no circumstances try to rob the <span class="it">caisse</span>
and he put the contingency out of his mind. Instead he
explored his present physical sensations. He felt the dry,
uncomfortable gravel under his evening shoes, the bad,
harsh taste in his mouth and the slight sweat under his
arms. He could feel his eyes filling their sockets. The front
of his face, his nose and antrum, were congested. He
breathed the sweet night air deeply and focused his senses
and his wits. He wanted to know if anyone had searched
his room since he had left it before dinner.</p>

<p class="pindent">He walked across the broad boulevard and through the
gardens to the Hôtel Splendide. He smiled at the <span class="it">concierge</span>
who gave him his key—No 45 on the first floor—and took
the cable.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was from Jamaica and read:</p>

<pre class="calibre5">
    KINGSTONJA XXXX XXXXXX XXXX XXX
    BOND SPLENDIDE ROYALE-LES-EAUX SEINE IN-
    FERIEURE HAVANA CIGAR PRODUCTION ALL
    CUBAN FACTORIES 1915 TEN MILLION REPEAT
    TEN MILLION STOP HOPE THIS FIGURE YOU
    REQUIRE REGARDS.              DASILVA
</pre>

<p class="pindent">This meant that ten million francs was on the way to
him. It was the reply to a request Bond had sent that afternoon
through Paris to his headquarters in London asking
for more funds. Paris had spoken to London where
Clements, the head of Bond’s department, had spoken to
M, who had smiled wryly and told ‘The Broker’ to fix it
with the Treasury.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had once worked in Jamaica and his cover on the
Royale assignment was that of a very rich client of Messrs
Caffery, the principal import and export firm of Jamaica.
So he was being controlled through Jamaica, through a
taciturn man who was head of the picture desk on the
<span class="it">Daily Gleaner</span>, the famous newspaper of the Caribbean.</p>

<p class="pindent">This man on the <span class="it">Gleaner</span>, whose name was Fawcett, had
been book-keeper for one of the leading turtle-fisheries on
the Cayman Islands. One of the men from the Caymans
who had volunteered on the outbreak of war, he had ended
up as a Paymaster’s clerk in a small Naval Intelligence
organization in Malta. At the end of the war, when, with
a heavy heart, he was due to return to the Caymans, he was
spotted by the section of the Secret Service concerned with
the Caribbean. He was strenuously trained in photography
and in some other arts and, with the quiet connivance of
an influential man in Jamaica, found his way to the picture
desk of the <span class="it">Gleaner</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the intervals between sifting photographs submitted
by the great agencies—Keystone, Wide-World, Universal,
INP, and Reuter-Photo—he would get peremptory
instructions by telephone from a man he had never met to
carry out certain simple operations requiring nothing but
absolute discretion, speed, and accuracy. For these occasional
services he received twenty pounds a month paid
into his account with the Royal Bank of Canada by a
fictitious relative in England.</p>

<p class="pindent">Fawcett’s present assignment was to relay immediately
to Bond, full rates, the text of messages which he received
at home by telephone from his anonymous contact. He
had been told by this contact that nothing he would be
asked to send would arouse the suspicion of the Jamaican
post office. So he was not surprised to find himself suddenly
appointed string correspondent for the ‘Maritime Press
and Photo Agency’, with press-collect facilities to France
and England, on a further monthly retainer of ten pounds.</p>

<p class="pindent">He felt secure and encouraged, had visions of a BEM
and made the first payment on a Morris Minor. He also
bought a green eye-shade which he had long coveted and
which helped him to impose his personality on the picture
desk.</p>

<p class="pindent">Some of this background to his cable passed through
Bond’s mind. He was used to oblique control and rather
liked it. He felt it feather-bedded him a little, allowed him
to give or take an hour or two in his communications with
M. He knew that this was probably a fallacy, that probably
there was another member of the Service at Royale-les-Eaux
who was reporting independently, but it did give the
illusion that he wasn’t only 150 miles across the Channel
from that deadly office building near Regent’s Park, being
watched and judged by those few cold brains that made the
whole show work. Just as Fawcett, the Cayman Islander in
Kingston, knew that if he bought that Morris Minor outright
instead of signing the hire-purchase agreement, someone
in London would probably know and want to know
where the money had come from.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond read the cable twice. He tore a telegram form off
the pad on the desk (why give them carbon copies?) and
wrote his reply in capital letters:</p>

<pre class="calibre5">
    THANKS INFORMATION SHOULD SUFFICE—BOND
</pre>

<p class="pindent">He handed this to the <span class="it">concierge</span> and put the cable signed
‘Dasilva’ in his pocket. The employers (if any) of the
<span class="it">concierge</span> could bribe a copy out of the local post office, if
the <span class="it">concierge</span> hadn’t already steamed the envelope open or
read the cable upside down in Bond’s hands.</p>

<p class="pindent">He took his key and said good night and turned to the stairs,
shaking his head at the liftman. Bond knew what an obliging
danger-signal a lift could be. He didn’t expect anyone to be
moving on the first floor, but he preferred to be prudent.</p>

<p class="pindent">Walking quietly up on the balls of his feet, he regretted
the <span class="it">hubris</span> of his reply to M <span class="it">via</span> Jamaica. As a gambler he
knew it was a mistake to rely on too small a capital. Anyway,
M probably wouldn’t let him have any more. He
shrugged his shoulders and turned off the stairs into the
corridor and walked softly to the door of his room.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond knew exactly where the switch was and it was with
one flow of motion that he stood on the threshold with the
door full open, the light on and a gun in his hand. The safe,
empty room sneered at him. He ignored the half-open door
of the bathroom and, locking himself in, he turned up the
bed-light and the mirror-light and threw his gun on the
settee beside the window. Then he bent down and inspected
one of his own black hairs which still lay undisturbed where
he had left it before dinner, wedged into the drawer of the
writing-desk.</p>

<p class="pindent">Next he examined a faint trace of talcum powder on the
inner rim of the porcelain handle of the clothes cupboard.
It appeared immaculate. He went into the bathroom, lifted
the cover of the lavatory cistern and verified the level of the
water against a small scratch on the copper ball-cock.</p>

<p class="pindent">Doing all this, inspecting these minute burglar-alarms,
did not make him feel foolish or self-conscious. He was
a secret agent, and still alive thanks to his exact attention to
the detail of his profession. Routine precautions were to
him no more unreasonable than they would be to a deep-sea
diver or a test pilot, or to any man earning danger-money.</p>

<p class="pindent">Satisfied that his room had not been searched while he
was at the casino, Bond undressed and took a cold shower.
Then he lit his seventieth cigarette of the day and sat down
at the writing-table with the thick wad of his stake money
and winnings beside him and entered some figures in a
small note-book. Over the two days’ play, he was up
exactly three million francs. In London he had been issued
with ten million, and he had asked London for a further ten.
With this on its way to the local branch of Crédit Lyonnais,
his working capital amounted to twenty-three
million francs, or some twenty-three thousand pounds.</p>

<p class="pindent">For a few moments Bond sat motionless, gazing out of
the window across the dark sea, then he shoved the bundle
of banknotes under the pillow of the ornate single bed,
cleaned his teeth, turned out the lights and climbed with
relief between the harsh French sheets. For ten minutes he
lay on his left side reflecting on the events of the day. Then
he turned over and focused his mind towards the tunnel of
sleep.</p>

<p class="pindent">His last action was to slip his right hand under the pillow
until it rested under the butt of the ·38 Colt Police Positive
with the sawn barrel. Then he slept, and with the warmth
and humour of his eyes extinguished, his features relapsed
into a taciturn mask, ironical, brutal, and cold.</p>
