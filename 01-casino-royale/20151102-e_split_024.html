<p class="pindent">From that day Bond’s recovery was rapid.</p>

<p class="pindent">He sat up in bed and wrote his report to M. He made
light of what he still considered amateurish behaviour on
the part of Vesper. By juggling with the emphasis, he made
the kidnapping sound much more Machiavellian than it had
been. He praised Vesper’s coolness and composure
throughout the whole episode without saying that he had
found some of her actions unaccountable.</p>

<p class="pindent">Every day Vesper came to see him and he looked forward
to these visits with excitement. She talked happily of
her adventures of the day before, her explorations down
the coast and the restaurants where she had eaten. She had
made friends with the chief of police and with one of the
directors of the Casino and it was they who took her out in
the evening and occasionally lent her a car during the day.
She kept an eye on the repairs to the Bentley which had
been towed down to coachbuilders at Rouen, and she even
arranged for some new clothes to be sent out from Bond’s
London flat. Nothing survived from his original wardrobe.
Every stitch had been cut to ribbons in the search for the
forty million francs.</p>

<p class="pindent">The Le Chiffre affair was never mentioned between
them. She occasionally told Bond amusing stories of Head
of S’s office. She had apparently transferred there from the
WRNS. And he told her of some of his adventures in the
Service.</p>

<p class="pindent">He found he could speak to her easily and he was surprised.</p>

<p class="pindent">With most women his manner was a mixture of taciturnity
and passion. The lengthy approaches to a seduction
bored him almost as much as the subsequent mess of
disentanglement. He found something grisly in the
inevitability of the pattern of each affair. The conventional
parabola—sentiment, the touch of the hand, the kiss, the
passionate kiss, the feel of the body, the climax in the bed,
then more bed, then less bed, then the boredom, the tears
and the final bitterness—was to him shameful and hypocritical.
Even more he shunned the <span class="it">mise en scène</span> for each of
these acts in the play—the meeting at a party, the restaurant,
the taxi, his flat, her flat, then the week-end by the sea, then
the flats again, then the furtive alibis and the final angry
farewell on some doorstep in the rain.</p>

<p class="pindent">But with Vesper there could be none of this.</p>

<p class="pindent">In the dull room and the boredom of his treatment her
presence was each day an oasis of pleasure, something to
look forward to. In their talk there was nothing but companionship
with a distant undertone of passion. In the
background there was the unspoken zest of the promise
which, in due course and in their own time, would be met.
Over all there brooded the shadow of his injuries and the
tantalus of their slow healing.</p>

<p class="pindent">Whether Bond liked it or not, the branch had already
escaped his knife and was ready to burst into flower.</p>

<p class="pindent">With enjoyable steps Bond recovered. He was allowed
up. Then he was allowed to sit in the garden. Then he
could go for a short walk, then for a long drive. And then
the afternoon came when the doctor appeared on a flying
visit from Paris and pronounced him well again. His
clothes were brought round by Vesper, farewells were
exchanged with the nurses, and a hired car drove them
away.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was three weeks from the day when he had been on the
edge of death, and now it was July and the hot summer
shimmered down the coast and out to sea. Bond clasped
the moment to him.</p>

<p class="pindent">Their destination was to be a surprise for him. He had
not wanted to go back to one of the big hotels in Royale
and Vesper said she would find somewhere away from the
town. But she insisted on being mysterious about it and
only said that she had found a place he would like. He was
happy to be in her hands, but he covered up his surrender
by referring to their destination as ‘Trou sur Mer’ (she
admitted it was by the sea), and lauding the rustic delights
of outside lavatories, bed-bugs, and cockroaches.</p>

<p class="pindent">Their drive was spoiled by a curious incident.</p>

<p class="pindent">While they followed the coast road in the direction of
Les Noctambules, Bond described to her his wild chase in
the Bentley, finally pointing out the curve he had taken
before the crash and the exact place where the vicious
carpet of spikes had been laid. He slowed the car down and
leant out to show her the deep cuts in the tarmac made by
the rims of the wheels and the broken branches in the
hedge and the patch of oil where the car had come to rest.</p>

<p class="pindent">But all the time she was distrait and fidgety and commented
only in monosyllables. Once or twice he caught her
glancing in the driving-mirror, but when he had a chance
to look back through the rear window, they had just
rounded a bend and he could see nothing.</p>

<p class="pindent">Finally he took her hand.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Something’s on your mind, Vesper,’ he said.</p>

<p class="pindent">She gave him a taut, bright smile. ‘It’s nothing. Absolutely
nothing. I had a silly idea we were being followed.
It’s just nerves, I suppose. This road is full of ghosts.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Under cover of a short laugh she looked back again.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Look.’ There was an edge of panic in her voice.</p>

<p class="pindent">Obediently Bond turned his head. Sure enough, a
quarter of a mile away, a black saloon was coming after
them at a good pace.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘We can’t be the only people using this road,’ he said.
‘Anyway, who wants to follow us? We’ve done nothing
wrong.’ He patted her hand. ‘It’s a middle-aged commercial
traveller in car-polish on his way to Le Havre. He’s
probably thinking of his lunch and his mistress in Paris.
Really, Vesper, you mustn’t think evil of the innocent.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘I expect you’re right,’ she said nervously. ‘Anyway,
we’re nearly there.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She relapsed into silence and gazed out of the window.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond could still feel her tenseness. He smiled to himself
at what he took to be simply a hangover from their recent
adventures. But he decided to humour her and when they
came to a small lane leading towards the sea and slowed to
turn down it, he told the driver to stop directly they were
off the main road.</p>

<p class="pindent">Hidden by the tall hedge, they watched together through
the rear window.</p>

<p class="pindent">Through the quiet hum of summer noises they could
hear the car approaching. Vesper dug her fingers into his
arm. The pace of the car did not alter as it approached their
hiding-place and they had only a brief glimpse of a man’s
profile as a black saloon tore by.</p>

<p class="pindent">It was true that he seemed to glance quickly towards
them, but above them in the hedge there was a gaily painted
sign pointing down the lane and announcing ‘<span class="it">L’Auberge du
Fruit Défendu, crustaces, fritures</span>’. It was obvious to Bond
that it was this that had caught the driver’s eye.</p>

<p class="pindent">As the rattle of the car’s exhaust diminished down the
road, Vesper sank back into her corner. Her face was pale.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He looked at us,’ she said, ‘I told you so. I knew we
were being followed. Now they know where we are.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond could not contain his impatience. ‘Bunkum,’ he
said. ‘He was looking at that sign.’ He pointed it out to
Vesper.</p>

<p class="pindent">She looked slightly relieved. ‘Do you really think so?’
she asked. ‘Yes. I see. Of course, you must be right. Come
on. I’m sorry to be so stupid. I don’t know what came
over me.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She leant forward and talked to the driver through the
partition, and the car moved on. She sank back and turned
a bright face towards Bond. The colour had almost come
back to her cheeks. ‘I really am sorry. It’s just that . . .
it’s that I can’t believe everything’s over and there’s no one
to be frightened of any more.’ She pressed his hand. ‘You
must think me very stupid.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course not,’ said Bond. ‘But really nobody could
be interested in us now. Forget it all. The whole job’s
finished, wiped up. This is our holiday and there’s not a
cloud in the sky. Is there?’ he persisted.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘No, of course not.’ She shook herself slightly. ‘I’m mad.
Now we’ll be there in a second. I do hope you’re going to
like it.’</p>

<p class="pindent">They both leant forward. Animation was back in her
face and the incident left only the smallest question-mark
hanging in the air. Even that faded as they came through
the dunes and saw the sea and the modest little inn amongst
the pines.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s not very grand, I’m afraid,’ said Vesper. ‘But it’s
very clean and the food’s wonderful.’ She looked at him
anxiously.</p>

<p class="pindent">She need not have worried. Bond loved the place at
first sight—the terrace leading almost to the high-tide mark,
the low two-storied house with gay brick-red awnings over
the windows and the crescent-shaped bay of blue water
and golden sands. How many times in his life would he
have given anything to have turned off a main road to
find a lost corner like this where he could let the world go
by and live in the sea from dawn to dusk. And now he was
to have a whole week of this. And of Vesper. In his mind
he fingered the necklace of the days to come.</p>

<p class="pindent">They drew up in the courtyard behind the house and the
proprietor and his wife came out to greet them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Monsieur Versoix was a middle-aged man with one arm.
The other he had lost fighting with the Free French in
Madagascar. He was a friend of the chief of police of Royale
and it was the Commissaire who had suggested the place
to Vesper and had spoken to the proprietor on the telephone.
As a result, nothing was going to be too good for
them.</p>

<p class="pindent">Madame Versoix had been interrupted in the middle of
preparing dinner. She wore an apron and held a wooden
spoon in one hand. She was younger than her husband,
chubby and handsome and warm-eyed. Instinctively Bond
guessed that they had no children and that they gave their
thwarted affection to their friends and some regular
customers, and probably to some pets. He thought that
their life was probably something of a struggle and that the
inn must be very lonely in winter-time with the big seas
and the noise of the wind in the pines.</p>

<p class="pindent">The proprietor showed them to their rooms.</p>

<p class="pindent">Vesper’s was a double room and Bond was next door, at
the corner of the house, with one window looking out to
sea and another with a view of the distant arm of the bay.
There was a bathroom between them. Everything was
spotless, and sparsely comfortable.</p>

<p class="pindent">The proprietor was pleased when they both showed
their delight. He said that dinner would be at seven-thirty
and that <span class="it">Madame la patronne</span> was preparing broiled
lobsters with melted butter. He was sorry that they were so
quiet just then. It was Tuesday. There would be more
people at the week-end. The season had not been good.
Generally they had plenty of English people staying, but
times were difficult over there and the English just came
for a week-end at Royale and then went home after losing
their money at the Casino. It was not like the old days. He
shrugged his shoulders philosophically. But then no day
was like the day before, and no century like the previous
one, and . . .</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Quite so,’ said Bond.</p>
