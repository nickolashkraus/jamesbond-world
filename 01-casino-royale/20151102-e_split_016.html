<p class="pindent">The entrance to the Roi Galant was a seven-foot
golden picture-frame which had once, perhaps, enclosed
the vast portrait of a noble European. It was in a
discreet corner of the ‘kitchen’—the public roulette and
boule room, where several tables were still busy. As Bond
took Vesper’s arm and led her over the gilded step, he
fought back a hankering to borrow some money from the
<span class="it">caisse</span> and plaster maximums over the nearest table. But he
knew that this would be a brash and cheap gesture <span class="it">pour
épater la bourgeoisie</span>. Whether he won or lost, it would be a
kick in the teeth to the luck which had been given him.</p>

<p class="pindent">The night-club was small and dark, lit only by candles
in gilded candelabra whose warm light was repeated in wall
mirrors set in more gold picture-frames. The walls were
covered in dark red satin and the chairs and <span class="it">banquettes</span> in
matching red plush. In the far corner, a trio, consisting of
a piano, an electric guitar and drums, was playing ‘La Vie
en Rose’ with muted sweetness. Seduction dripped on the
quietly throbbing air. It seemed to Bond that every couple
must be touching with passion under the tables.</p>

<p class="pindent">They were given a corner table near the door. Bond
ordered a bottle of Veuve Clicquot and scrambled eggs and
bacon.</p>

<p class="pindent">They sat for a time listening to the music and then Bond
turned to Vesper: ‘It’s wonderful sitting here with you and
knowing the job’s finished. It’s a lovely end to the day—the
prize-giving.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He expected her to smile. She said: ‘Yes, isn’t it,’ in a
rather brittle voice. She seemed to be listening carefully
to the music. One elbow rested on the table and her hand
supported her chin, but on the back of her hand and not on
the palm, and Bond noticed that her knuckles showed
white as if her fist was tightly clenched.</p>

<p class="pindent">Between the thumb and first two fingers of her right
hand she held one of Bond’s cigarettes, as an artist holds a
crayon, and though she smoked with composure, she
tapped the cigarette occasionally into an ash-tray when the
cigarette had no ash.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond noticed these small things because he felt intensely
aware of her and because he wanted to draw her into his
own feeling of warmth and relaxed sensuality. But he
accepted her reserve. He thought it came from a desire to
protect herself from him, or else it was her reaction to his
coolness to her earlier in the evening, his deliberate coolness,
which he knew had been taken as a rebuff.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was patient. He drank champagne and talked a
little about the happenings of the day and about the personalities
of Mathis and Leiter and about the possible consequences
for Le Chiffre. He was discreet and he only talked
about the aspects of the case on which she must have been
briefed by London.</p>

<p class="pindent">She answered perfunctorily. She said that, of course,
they had picked out the two gunmen, but had thought
nothing of it when the man with the stick had gone to
stand behind Bond’s chair. They could not believe that
anything would be attempted in the Casino itself. Directly
Bond and Leiter had left to walk over to the hotel, she had
telephoned Paris and told M’s representative of the result
of the game. She had had to speak guardedly and the agent
had rung off without comment. She had been told to do this
whatever the result. M had asked for the information to be
passed on to him personally at any time of the day or
night.</p>

<p class="pindent">This was all she said. She sipped at her champagne and
rarely glanced at Bond. She didn’t smile. Bond felt frustrated.
He drank a lot of champagne and ordered another
bottle. The scrambled eggs came and they ate in silence.</p>

<p class="pindent">At four o’clock Bond was about to call for the bill when
the <span class="it">maître d’hôtel</span> appeared at their table and inquired for
Miss Lynd. He handed her a note which she took and read
hastily.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Oh, it’s only Mathis,’ she said. ‘He says would I come
to the entrance hall. He’s got a message for you. Perhaps
he’s not in evening clothes or something. I won’t be a
minute. Then perhaps we could go home.’</p>

<p class="pindent">She gave him a strained smile. ‘I’m afraid I don’t feel
very good company this evening. It’s been rather a nerve-racking
day. I’m so sorry.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond made a perfunctory reply and rose, pushing back
the table. ‘I’ll get the bill,’ he said, and watched her take
the few steps to the entrance.</p>

<p class="pindent">He sat down and lit a cigarette. He felt flat. He suddenly
realized that he was tired. The stuffiness of the room hit
him as it had hit him in the Casino in the early hours of
the previous day. He called for the bill and took a last
mouthful of champagne. It tasted bitter, as the first glass
too many always does. He would have liked to have seen
Mathis’s cheerful face and heard his news, perhaps even a
word of congratulation.</p>

<p class="pindent">Suddenly the note to Vesper seemed odd to him. It was
not the way Mathis would do things. He would have asked
them both to join him at the bar of the Casino or he would
have joined them in the night-club, whatever his clothes.
They would have laughed together and Mathis would have
been excited. He had much to tell Bond, more than Bond
had to tell him. The arrest of the Bulgarian, who had
probably talked some more; the chase after the man with
the stick; Le Chiffre’s movements when he left the
Casino.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shook himself. He hastily paid the bill, not waiting
for the change. He pushed back his table and walked
quickly through the entrance without acknowledging the
good-nights of the <span class="it">maître d’hôtel</span> and the doorman.</p>

<p class="pindent">He hurried through the gaming-room and looked carefully
up and down the long entrance hall. He cursed and
quickened his step. There were only one or two officials
and two or three men and women in evening clothes getting
their things at the <span class="it">vestiaire</span>.</p>

<p class="pindent">No Vesper. No Mathis.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was almost running. He got to the entrance and
looked along the steps to left and right down and amongst
the few remaining cars.</p>

<p class="pindent">The commissionaire came towards him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A taxi, monsieur?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond waved him aside and started down the steps, his
eyes staring into the shadows, the night air cold on his
sweating temples.</p>

<p class="pindent">He was half-way down when he heard a faint cry, then
the slam of a door way to the right. With a harsh growl
and stutter from the exhaust a beetle-browed Citroën shot
out of the shadows into the light of the moon, its front-wheel
drive dry-skidding through the loose pebbles of the
forecourt.</p>

<p class="pindent">Its tail rocked on its soft springs as if a violent struggle
were taking place on the back seat.</p>

<p class="pindent">With a snarl it raced out to the wide entrance gate in a
spray of gravel. A small black object shot out of an open
rear window and thudded into a flower-bed. There was a
scream of tortured rubber as the tyres caught the boulevard
in a harsh left-handed turn, the deafening echo of a Citroën’s
exhaust in second gear, a crash into top, then a
swiftly diminishing crackle as the car hared off between
the shops on the main street towards the coast road.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond knew he would find Vesper’s evening bag among
the flowers.</p>

<p class="pindent">He ran back with it across the gravel to the brightly-lit
steps and scrabbled through its contents while the commissionaire
hovered round him.</p>

<p class="pindent">The crumpled note was there amongst the usual feminine
baggage.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="pindent">Can you come out to the entrance hall for a moment? I have
news for your companion.</p>

<p class="line5"><span class="sc">René Mathis</span></p>
