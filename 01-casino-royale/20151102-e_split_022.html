<p class="pindent">Bond made good progress. When Mathis came to see
him three days later he was propped up in bed and his
arms were free. The lower half of his body was still shrouded
in the oblong tent, but he looked cheerful and it was
only occasionally that a twinge of pain narrowed his eyes.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis looked crestfallen.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Here’s your cheque,’ he said to Bond. ‘I’ve rather
enjoyed walking around with forty million francs in my
pocket, but I suppose you’d better sign it and I’ll put it to
your account with the Crédit Lyonnais. There’s no sign of
our friend from <span class="sc">smersh</span>. Not a damn trace. He must have
got to the villa on foot or on a bicycle because you heard
nothing of his arrival and the two gunmen obviously didn’t.
It’s pretty exasperating. We’ve got precious little on this
<span class="sc">smersh</span> organization and neither has London. Washington
said they had, but it turned out to be the usual waffle
from refugee interrogation, and you know that’s about
as much good as interrogating an English man-in-the-street
about his own Secret Service, or a Frenchman about the
Deuxième.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘He probably came from Leningrad to Berlin via Warsaw,’
said Bond. ‘From Berlin they’ve got plenty of
routes open to the rest of Europe. He’s back home by now
being told off for not shooting me too. I fancy they’ve got
quite a file on me in view of one or two of the jobs M’s
given me since the war. He obviously thought he was being
smart enough cutting his initial in my hand.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘What’s that?’ asked Mathis. ‘The doctor said the cuts
looked like a square M with a tail to the top. He said they
didn’t mean anything.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, I only got a glimpse before I passed out, but I’ve
seen the cuts several times while they were being dressed
and I’m pretty certain they are the Russian letter for SH.
It’s rather like an inverted M with a tail. That would make
sense; <span class="sc">smersh</span> is short for <span class="sc">smyert shpionam</span>—Death
to Spies—and he thinks he’s labelled me as a <span class="sc">shpion</span>. It’s a
nuisance because M will probably say I’ve got to go to
hospital again when I get back to London and have new
skin grafted over the whole of the back of my hand. It
doesn’t matter much. I’ve decided to resign.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis looked at him with his mouth open.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Resign?’ he asked incredulously. ‘What the hell for?’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond looked away from Mathis. He studied his bandaged
hands.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘When I was being beaten up,’ he said, ‘I suddenly
liked the idea of being alive. Before Le Chiffre began, he
used a phrase which stuck in my mind . . . “playing Red
Indians”. He said that’s what I had been doing. Well, I
suddenly thought he might be right.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You see,’ he said, still looking down at his bandages,
‘when one’s young, it seems very easy to distinguish between
right and wrong, but as one gets older it becomes
more difficult. At school it’s easy to pick out one’s own
villains and heroes and one grows up wanting to be a hero
and kill the villains.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He looked obstinately at Mathis.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, in the last few years I’ve killed two villains. The
first was in New York—a Japanese cipher expert cracking
our codes on the thirty-sixth floor of the RCA building in
the Rockefeller centre, where the Japs had their consulate.
I took a room on the fortieth floor of the next-door skyscraper
and I could look across the street into his room and
see him working. Then I got a colleague from our organization
in New York and a couple of Remington thirty-thirty’s
with telescopic sights and silencers. We smuggled
them up to my room and sat for days waiting for our
chance. He shot at the man a second before me. His job was
only to blast a hole through the windows so that I could
shoot the Jap through it. They have tough windows at the
Rockefeller centre to keep the noise out. It worked very
well. As I expected, his bullet got deflected by the glass
and went God knows where. But I shot immediately after
him, through the hole he had made. I got the Jap in the
mouth as he turned to gape at the broken window.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smoked for a minute.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It was a pretty sound job. Nice and clean too. Three
hundred yards away. No personal contact. The next time
in Stockholm wasn’t so pretty. I had to kill a Norwegian
who was doubling against us for the Germans. He’d
managed to get two of our men captured—probably
bumped off for all I know. For various reasons it had to be
an absolutely silent job. I chose the bedroom of his flat and
a knife. And, well, he just didn’t die very quickly.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘For those two jobs I was awarded a Double O number
in the Service. Felt pretty clever and got a reputation for
being good and tough. A double O number in our Service
means you’ve had to kill a chap in cold blood in the course
of some job.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now,’ he looked up again at Mathis, ‘that’s all very
fine. The hero kills two villains, but when the hero Le
Chiffre starts to kill the villain Bond and the villain Bond
knows he isn’t a villain at all, you see the other side of the
medal. The villains and heroes get all mixed up.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Of course,’ he added, as Mathis started to expostulate,
‘patriotism comes along and makes it seem fairly all right,
but this country-right-or-wrong business is getting a little
out-of-date. Today we are fighting Communism. Okay.
If I’d been alive fifty years ago, the brand of Conservatism
we have today would have been damn near called Communism
and we should have been told to go and fight that.
History is moving pretty quickly these days and the heroes
and villains keep on changing parts.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis stared at him aghast. Then he tapped his head
and put a calming hand on Bond’s arm.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You mean to say that this precious Le Chiffre who did
his best to turn you into a eunuch doesn’t qualify as a
villain?’ he asked. ‘Anyone would think from the rot you
talk that he had been battering your head instead of your
. . .’ He gestured down the bed. ‘You wait till M tells
you to get after another Le Chiffre. I bet you’ll go after
him all right. And what about <span class="sc">smersh</span>? I can tell you I
don’t like the idea of these chaps running around France
killing anyone they feel has been a traitor to their precious
political system. You’re a bloody anarchist.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He threw his arms in the air and let them fall helplessly
to his sides.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond laughed.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘All right,’ he said. ‘Take our friend Le Chiffre. It’s
simple enough to say he was an evil man, at least it’s simple
enough for me because he did evil things to me. If he was
here now, I wouldn’t hesitate to kill him, but out of personal
revenge and not, I’m afraid, for some high moral reason or
for the sake of my country.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He looked up at Mathis to see how bored he was getting
with these introspective refinements of what, to Mathis, was
a simple question of duty.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis smiled back at him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Continue, my dear friend. It is interesting for me to see
this new Bond. Englishmen are so odd. They are like a
nest of Chinese boxes. It takes a very long time to get to
the centre of them. When one gets there the result is unrewarding,
but the process is instructive and entertaining.
Continue. Develop your arguments. There may be something
I can use to my own chief the next time I want to get
out of an unpleasant job.’ He grinned maliciously.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond ignored him.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Now in order to tell the difference between good and
evil, we have manufactured two images representing the
extremes—representing the deepest black and the purest
white—and we call them God and the Devil. But in doing
so we have cheated a bit. God is a clear image, you can see
every hair on His beard. But the Devil. What does he look
like?’ Bond looked triumphantly at Mathis.</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis laughed ironically.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘A woman.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘It’s all very fine,’ said Bond, ‘but I’ve been thinking
about these things and I’m wondering whose side I ought
to be on. I’m getting very sorry for the Devil and his disciples
such as the good Le Chiffre. The Devil has a rotten
time and I always like to be on the side of the underdog.
We don’t give the poor chap a chance. There’s a Good
Book about goodness and how to be good and so forth, but
there’s no Evil Book about evil and how to be bad. The
Devil has no prophets to write his Ten Commandments and
no team of authors to write his biography. His case has
gone completely by default. We know nothing about him
but a lot of fairy stories from our parents and schoolmasters.
He has no book from which we can learn the nature of evil
in all its forms, with parables about evil people, proverbs
about evil people, folk-lore about evil people. All we have
is the living example of the people who are least good, or
our own intuition.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘So,’ continued Bond, warming to his argument, ‘Le
Chiffre was serving a wonderful purpose, a really vital
purpose, perhaps the best and highest purpose of all. By
his evil existence, which foolishly I have helped to destroy,
he was creating a norm of badness by which, and by which
alone, an opposite norm of goodness could exist. We were
privileged, in our short knowledge of him, to see and estimate
his wickedness and we emerge from the acquaintanceship
better and more virtuous men.’</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Bravo,’ said Mathis. ‘I’m proud of you. You ought to
be tortured every day. I really must remember to do
something evil this evening. I must start at once. I have
a few marks in my favour—only small ones, alas,’ he added
ruefully—‘but I shall work fast now that I have seen the
light. What a splendid time I’m going to have. Now, let’s
see, where shall I start, murder, arson, rape? But no, these
are peccadilloes. I must really consult the good Marquis de
Sade. I am a child, an absolute child in these matters.’</p>

<p class="pindent">His face fell.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Ah, but our conscience, my dear Bond. What shall we
do with him while we are committing some juicy sin?
That is a problem. He is a crafty person this conscience
and very old, as old as the first family of apes which gave
birth to him. We must give that problem really careful
thought or we shall spoil our enjoyment. Of course, we
should murder him first, but he is a tough bird. It will be
difficult, but if we succeed, we could be worse even than Le
Chiffre.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘For you, dear James, it is easy. You can start off by
resigning. That was a brilliant thought of yours, a splendid
start to your new career. And so simple. Everyone has
the revolver of resignation in his pocket. All you’ve got
to do is pull the trigger and you will have made a big hole
in your country and your conscience at the same time. A
murder and a suicide with one bullet! Splendid! What a
difficult and glorious profession. As for me, I must start
embracing the new cause at once.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He looked at his watch.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Good. I’ve started already. I’m half an hour late for a
meeting with the chief of police.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He rose to his feet laughing.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘That was most enjoyable, my dear James. You really
ought to go on the halls. Now about that little problem of
yours, this business of not knowing good men from bad
men and villains from heroes, and so forth. It is, of course,
a difficult problem in the abstract. The secret lies in personal
experience, whether you’re a Chinaman or an Englishman.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He paused at the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘You admit that Le Chiffre did you personal evil and
that you would kill him if he appeared in front of you now?</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Well, when you get back to London you will find there
are other Le Chiffres seeking to destroy you and your
friends and your country. M will tell you about them.
And now that you have seen a really evil man, you will
know how evil they can be and you will go after them to
destroy them in order to protect yourself and the people
you love. You won’t wait to argue about it. You know
what they look like now and what they can do to people.
You may be a bit more choosy about the jobs you take
on. You may want to be certain that the target really is
black, but there are plenty of really black targets around.
There’s still plenty for you to do. And you’ll do it. And
when you fall in love and have a mistress or a wife and
children to look after, it will seem all the easier.’</p>

<p class="pindent">Mathis opened the door and stopped on the threshold.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Surround yourself with human beings, my dear James.
They are easier to fight for than principles.’</p>

<p class="pindent">He laughed. ‘But don’t let me down and become human
yourself. We would lose such a wonderful machine.’</p>

<p class="pindent">With a wave of the hand he shut the door.</p>

<p class="pindent">‘Hey,’ shouted Bond.</p>

<p class="pindent">But the footsteps went quickly off down the passage.</p>
