"You know what?" said Major
Dexter Smythe to the octopus.  "You're going to
have a real treat today if I can manage it."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
He had spoken aloud, and his breath had steamed
up the glass of his Pirelli mask.  He put his feet down
to the sand beside the coral boulder and stood up.
The water reached to his armpits.  He took off
the mask and spat into it, rubbed the spit round
the glass, rinsed it clean, and pulled the rubber band
of the mask back over his head.  He bent down
again.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The eye in the mottled brown sack was still
watching him carefully from the hole in the coral, but now
the tip of a single small tentacle wavered hesitatingly
an inch or two out of the shadows and quested
vaguely with its pink suckers uppermost.  Dexter
Smythe smiled with satisfaction.  Given time—perhaps
one more month on top of the two during
which he had been chumming the octopus—and he
would have tamed the darling.  But he wasn't going
to have that month.  Should he take a chance today
and reach down and offer his hand, instead of the
expected lump of raw meat on the end of his spear,
to the tentacle?  Shake it by the hand, so to speak?
No, Pussy, he thought.  I can't quite trust you yet.
Almost certainly other tentacles would whip out of
the hole and up his arm.  He only needed to be
dragged down less than two feet for the cork valve on
his mask to automatically close, and he would be
suffocated inside it or, if he tore it off, drowned.  He
might get in a quick lucky jab with his spear, but it
would take more than that to kill Pussy.  No.  Perhaps
later in the day.  It would be rather like playing
Russian roulette, and at about the same five-to-one odds.
It might be a quick, a whimsical, way out of his
troubles!  But not now.  It would leave the interesting
question unsolved.  And he had promised that nice
Professor Bengry at the Institute....  Dexter
Smythe swam leisurely off toward the reef, his eyes
questing for one shape only, the squat, sinister
wedge of a scorpionfish, or, as Bengry would put it,
<i class="calibre3">Scorpaena plumieri</i>.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Major Dexter Smythe, O.B.E., Royal Marines
(Retd.), was the remains of a once brave and
resourceful officer and of a handsome man who had
had the sexual run of his teeth all his life,
particularly among the Wrens and Wracs and ATS who
manned the communications and secretariat of the
very special task force to which he had been attached
at the end of his service career.  Now he was fifty-four
and slightly bald, and his belly sagged in his Jantzen
trunks.  And he had had two coronary thromboses,
the second (the "second warning" as his doctor,
Jimmy Greaves, who had been one of their high
poker game at Prince's Club when Dexter Smythe
had first come to Jamaica, had half jocularly put it)
only a month before.  But, in his well-chosen clothes,
with his varicose veins out of sight, and with his
stomach flattened by a discreet support belt behind
an immaculate cummerbund, he was still a fine
figure of a man at a cocktail party or dinner on the
North Shore.  And it was a mystery to his friends and
neighbors why, in defiance of the two ounces of
whiskey and the ten cigarettes a day to which his
doctor had rationed him, he persisted in smoking
like a chimney and going to bed drunk, if amiably
drunk, every night.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The truth of the matter was that Dexter Smythe
had arrived at the frontier of the death wish.  The
origins of this state of mind were many and not all
that complex.  He was irretrievably tied to Jamaica,
and tropical sloth had gradually riddled him so that,
while outwardly he appeared a piece of fairly solid
hardwood, inside the varnished surface, the termites
of sloth, self-indulgence, guilt over an ancient sin,
and general disgust with himself had eroded his once
hard core into dust.  Since the death of Mary two
years before, he had loved no one.  (He wasn't even
sure that he had really loved her, but he knew that,
every hour of the day, he missed her love of him and
her gay, untidy, chiding, and often irritating
presence.)  And though he ate their canapés and drank
their martinis, he had nothing but contempt for the
international riffraff with whom he consorted on the
North Shore.  He could perhaps have made friends
with the more solid elements—the gentleman-farmers
inland, the plantation owners on the coast,
the professional men, the politicians—but that
would mean regaining some serious purpose in life
which his sloth, his spiritual accidie, prevented, and
cutting down on the bottle, which he was definitely
unwilling to do.  So Major Smythe was bored, bored
to death, and, but for one factor in his life, he would
long ago have swallowed the bottle of barbiturates
he had easily acquired from a local doctor.  The
lifeline that kept him clinging to the edge of the cliff
was a tenuous one.  Heavy drinkers veer toward an
exaggeration of their basic temperaments, the classic
four—sanguine, phlegmatic, choleric, and
melancholic.  The sanguine drunk goes gay to the point of
hysteria and idiocy; the phlegmatic sinks into a
morass of sullen gloom; the choleric is the fighting
drunk of the cartoonists who spends much of his life
in prison for smashing people and things; and the
melancholic succumbs to self-pity, mawkishness, and
tears.  Major Smythe was a melancholic who had slid
into a drooling fantasy woven around the birds and
insects and fish that inhabited the five acres of
Wavelets (the name he had given his small villa was
symptomatic), its beach, and the coral reef beyond.  The
fish were his particular favorites.  He referred to
them as "people," and since reef fish stick to their
territories as closely as do most small birds, he knew
them all, after two years, intimately, "loved" them,
and believed that they loved him in return.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
They certainly knew him, as the denizens of zoos
know their keepers, because he was a daily and a
regular provider, scraping off algae and stirring up the
sand and rocks for the bottom-feeders, breaking up
sea eggs and sea urchins for the small carnivores, and
bringing out scraps of offal for the larger ones.  And
now, as he swam slowly and heavily up and down the
reef and through the channels that led out to deep
water, his "people" swarmed around him fearlessly
and expectantly, darting at the tip of the
three-pronged spear they knew only as a prodigal spoon,
flirting right up to the glass of the Pirelli, and even,
in the case of the fearless, pugnacious demoiselles,
nipping softly at his feet and legs.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Part of Major Smythe's mind took in all these
brilliantly colored little "people" and he greeted them
in unspoken words.  ("Morning, Beau Gregory" to
the dark blue demoiselle sprinkled with bright blue
spots—the jewelfish that exactly resembles the starlit
fashioning of a bottle of Guerlain's Dans La Nuit;
"Sorry.  Not today, sweetheart" to a fluttering
butterflyfish with false black eyes on its tail; and "You're
too fat anyway, Blue Boy," to an indigo parrotfish
that must have weighed a good ten pounds.)  But
today he had a job to do and his eyes were searching
for only one of his "people"—his only enemy on the
reef, the only one he killed on sight, a scorpionfish.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The scorpionfish inhabits most of the southern
waters of the world, and the rascasse that is the
foundation of bouillabaisse belongs to the family.  The
West Indian variety runs up to only about twelve
inches long and perhaps a pound in weight.  It is by
far the ugliest fish in the sea, as if nature were giving
warning.  It is a mottled brownish gray with a heavy
wedge-shaped shaggy head.  It has fleshy pendulous
"eyebrows" that droop over angry red eyes and a
coloration and broken silhouette that are perfect
camouflage on the reef.  Though a small fish, its heavily
toothed mouth is so wide that it can swallow whole
most of the smaller reef fishes, but its supreme
weapon lies in its erectile dorsal fins, the first few of
which, acting on contact like hypodermic needles,
are fed by poison glands containing enough dotoxin
to kill a man if they merely graze him in a vulnerable
spot—in an artery, for instance, or over the heart
or in the groin.  It constitutes the only real danger to
the reef swimmer, far more dangerous than the
barracuda or the shark, because, supreme in its
confidence in its camouflage and armory, it flees before
nothing except the very close approach of a foot or
actual contact.  Then it flits only a few yards, on
wide and bizarrely striped pectorals, and settles
again watchfully either on the sand, where it looks
like a lump of overgrown coral, or among the rocks
and seaweed where it virtually disappears.  And
Major Smythe was determined to find one and spear it
and give it to his octopus to see if it would take it or
spurn it—to see if one of the ocean's great predators
would recognize the deadliness of another, know of
its poison.  Would the octopus consume the belly
and leave the spines?  Would it eat the lot?  And if so,
would it suffer from the poison?  These were the
questions Bengry at the Institute wanted answered,
and today, since it was going to be the beginning of
the end of Major Smythe's life at Wavelets—and
though it might mean the end of his darling
Octopussy—Major Smythe had decided to find out the
answers and leave one tiny memorial to his now futile
life in some dusty corner of the Institute's marine
biological files.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
For, in only the last couple of hours, Major Dexter
Smythe's already dismal life had changed very much
for the worse.  So much for the worse that he would
be lucky if, in a few weeks' time—time for an
exchange of cables via Government House and the
Colonial Office to the Secret Service and thence to
Scotland Yard and the Public Prosecutor, and for Major
Smythe's transportation to London with a police
escort—he got away with a sentence of imprisonment
for life.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
And all this because of a man called Bond,
Commander James Bond, who had turned up at
ten-thirty that morning in a taxi from Kingston.
</p>

<p class="calibre1"><br class="calibre4"/></p>

<p class="calibre1">
The day had started normally.  Major Smythe had
awakened from his Seconal sleep, swallowed a couple
of Panadols (his heart condition forbade him
aspirin), showered, skimped his breakfast under the
umbrella-shaped sea almonds, and spent an hour
feeding the remains of his breakfast to the birds.  He then
took his prescribed doses of anticoagulant and
blood-pressure pills and killed time with the <i class="calibre3">Daily Gleaner</i>
until it was time for his elevenses, which, for some
months now, he had advanced to ten-thirty.  He had
just poured himself the first of two stiff brandy and
ginger ales (The Drunkard's Drink) when he heard
the car coming up the drive.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Luna, his colored housekeeper, came out into the
garden and announced "Gemmun to see you, Major."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"What's his name?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Him doan say, Major.  Him say to tell you him
come from Govment House."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Major Smythe was wearing nothing but a pair of
old khaki shorts and sandals.  He said, "All right,
Luna.  Put him in the living room and say I won't be
a moment."  And he went round the back way into
his bedroom and put on a white bush shirt and
trousers and brushed his hair.  Government House!  Now
what the hell?
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
As soon as he had walked through into the living
room and seen the tall man in the dark blue tropical
suit standing at the picture window looking out to
sea, Major Smythe had somehow sensed bad news.
And, when the man had turned slowly toward him
and looked at him with watchful, serious gray-blue
eyes, he had known that this was officialdom, and
when his cheery smile was not returned, inimical
officialdom.  And a chill had run down Major
Smythe's spine.  "They" had somehow found out.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Well, well.  I'm Smythe.  I gather you're from
Government House.  How's Sir Kenneth?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
There was somehow no question of shaking hands.
The man said, "I haven't met him.  I only arrived a
couple of days ago.  I've been out round the island
most of the time.  My name's Bond, James Bond.  I'm
from the Ministry of Defense."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Major Smythe remembered the hoary euphemism
for the Secret Service.  He said bonhomously, "Oh.
The old firm?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The question had been ignored.  "Is there
somewhere we can talk?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Rather.  Anywhere you like.  Here or in the
garden?  What about a drink?"  Major Smythe clinked
the ice in the glass he still held in his hand.  "Rum
and ginger's the local poison.  I prefer the ginger by
itself."  The lie came out with the automatic
smoothness of the alcoholic.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"No thanks.  And here would be fine."  The man
leaned negligently against the wide mahogany
windowsill.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Major Smythe sat down and threw a jaunty leg
over the low arm of one of the comfortable planters'
chairs he had had copied from an original by the
local cabinetmaker.  He pulled out the drink coaster
from the other arm, took a deep pull at his glass, and
slid it, with a consciously steady hand, down into the
hole in the wood.  "Well," he said cheerily, looking
the other man straight in the eyes, "what can I do for
you?  Somebody been up to some dirty work on the
North Shore and you need a spare hand?  Be glad to
get into harness again.  It's been a long time since
those days, but I can still remember some of the old
routines."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Do you mind if I smoke?"  The man had already
got his cigarette case in his hand.  It was a flat
gun-metal one that would hold around twenty-five.
Somehow this small sign of a shared weakness
comforted Major Smythe.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Of course, my dear fellow."  He made a move to
get up, his lighter ready.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"It's all right, thanks."  James Bond had already lit
his cigarette.  "No, it's nothing local.  I want to
... I've been sent out to ... ask you to recall your
work for the Service at the end of the war."  James
Bond paused and looked down at Major Smythe
carefully.  "Particularly the time when you were
working with the Miscellaneous Objectives Bureau."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Major Smythe laughed sharply.  He had known it.
He had known it for absolutely sure.  But when it
came out of this man's mouth, the laugh had been
forced out of Major Smythe like the scream of a hit
man.  "Oh Lord, yes.  Good old MOB.  That was a
lark all right."  He laughed again.  He felt the anginal
pain, brought on by the pressure of what he knew
was coming, build up across his chest.  He dipped his
hand into his trouser pocket, tilted the little bottle
into the palm of his hand, and slipped the white
TNT pill under his tongue.  He was amused to see
the tension coil up in the other man, the way the
eyes narrowed watchfully.  <i class="calibre3">It's all right, my dear
fellow.  This isn't a death pill</i>.  He said, "You troubled
with acidosis?  No?  It slays me when I go on a bender.
Last night.  Party at Jamaica Inn.  One really ought
to stop thinking one's always twenty-five.  Anyway,
let's get back to MOB Force.  Not many of us left, I
suppose."  He felt the pain across his chest withdraw
into its lair.  "Something to do with the Official History?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
James Bond looked down at the tip of his
cigarette.  "Not exactly."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"I expect you know I wrote most of the chapter on
the Force for the War Book.  It's fifteen years since
then.  Doubt if I'd have much to add today."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Nothing more about that operation in the
Tirol—place called Oberaurach, about a mile east of
Kitzbühel?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
One of the names he had been living with for
fifteen years forced another harsh laugh out of Major
Smythe.  "That was a piece of cake!  You've never
seen such a shambles.  All those Gestapo toughs with
their doxies.  All of 'em hog-drunk.  They'd kept their
files all ticketty-boo.  Handed them over without a
murmur.  Hoped that'd earn 'em easy treatment I
suppose.  We gave the stuff a first going-over and
shipped all the bods off to the Munich camp.  Last I
heard of them.  Most of them hanged for war crimes
I expect.  We handed the bumf over to HQ, at Salzburg.
Then we went on up the Mittersill valley after
another hideout."  Major Smythe took a good pull at
his drink and lit a cigarette.  He looked up.  "That's
the long and the short of it."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"You were Number Two at the time, I think.  The
CO was an American, a Colonel King from Patton's
army."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"That's right.  Nice fellow.  Wore a mustache,
which isn't like an American.  Knew his way among
the local wines.  Quite a civilized chap."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"In his report about the operation he wrote that
he handed you all the documents for a preliminary
run-through as you were the German expert with
the unit.  Then you gave them all back to him with
your comments?"  James Bond paused.  "Every single
one of them?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Major Smythe ignored the innuendo.  "That's
right.  Mostly lists of names.  Counterintelligence
dope.  The CI people in Salzburg were very pleased
with the stuff.  Gave them plenty of new leads.  I
expect the originals are lying about somewhere.
They'll have been used for the Nuremberg Trials.
Yes, by Jove!"—Major Smythe was reminiscent,
pally—"those were some of the jolliest months of my
life, haring around the country with MOB Force.
Wine, women, and song!  And you can say that
again!"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Here, Major Smythe was saying the whole truth.
He had had a dangerous and uncomfortable war
until 1945.  When the commandos were formed in
1941, he had volunteered and been seconded from
the Royal Marines to Combined Operations
Headquarters under Mountbatten.  There his excellent
German (his mother had come from Heidelberg)
had earned him the unenviable job of being
advanced interrogator on commando operations across
the Channel.  He had been lucky to get away from
two years of this work unscathed and with the
O.B.E. (Military), which was sparingly awarded in the last
war.  And then, in preparation for the defeat of
Germany, the Miscellaneous Objectives Bureau had
been formed jointly by the Secret Service and
Combined Operations, and Major Smythe had been
given the temporary rank of lieutenant colonel and
told to form a unit whose job would be the cleaning
up of Gestapo and Abwehr hideouts when the
collapse of Germany came about.  The OSS got to hear
of the scheme and insisted on getting into the act to
cope with the American wing of the front, and the
result was the creation of not one but six units that
went into operation in Germany and Austria on the
day of surrender.  They were units of twenty men,
each with a light armored car, six jeeps, a wireless
truck, and three lorries, and they were controlled by
a joint Anglo-American headquarters in SHAEF,
which also fed them with targets from the Army
Intelligence units and from the SIS and OSS.  Major
Smythe had been Number Two of "A" Force, which
had been allotted the Tirol—an area full of good
hiding places with easy access to Italy and perhaps
out of Europe—that was known to have been chosen
as funkhole Number One by the people MOB Force
was after.  And, as Major Smythe had just told Bond,
they had had themselves a ball.  All without firing a
shot—except, that is, two fired by Major Smythe.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
James Bond said casually, "Does the name of
Hannes Oberhauser ring a bell?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Major Smythe frowned, trying to remember.
"Can't say it does."  It was eighty degrees in the
shade, but he shivered.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Let me refresh your memory.  On the same day as
those documents were given to you to look over, you
made inquiries at the Tiefenbrünner Hotel, where
you were billeted, for the best mountain guide in
Kitzbühel.  You were referred to Oberhauser.  The
next day you asked your CO for a day's leave, which
was granted.  Early next morning you went to
Oberhauser's chalet, put him under close arrest, and
drove him away in your jeep.  Does that ring a bell?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
That phrase about "refreshing your memory."  How
often had Major Smythe himself used it when
he was trying to trap a German liar?  <i class="calibre3">Take your time!
You've been ready for something like this for years</i>.
Major Smythe shook his head doubtfully.  "Can't say
it does."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"A man with graying hair and a gammy leg.  Spoke
some English, he'd been a ski teacher before the
war."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Major Smythe looked candidly into the cold, clear
blue eyes.  "Sorry.  Can't help you."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
James Bond took a small blue leather notebook
out of his inside pocket and turned the leaves.  He
stopped turning them.  He looked up.  "At that time,
as side arms, you were carrying a regulation Webley-Scott
forty-five with the serial number
eight-nine-six-seven-three-sixty-two."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"It was certainly a Webley.  Damned clumsy
weapon.  Hope they've got something more like the
Luger or the heavy Beretta these days.  But I can't say
I ever took a note of the number."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"The number's right enough," said James Bond.
"I've got the date of its issue to you by HQ and the
date when you turned it in.  You signed the book
both times."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Major Smythe shrugged.  "Well then, it must have
been my gun.  But"—he put rather angry impatience
into his voice—"what, if I may ask, is all this in aid
of?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
James Bond looked at him almost with curiosity.
He said, and now his voice was not unkind, "You
know what it's all about, Smythe."  He paused and
seemed to reflect.  "Tell you what.  I'll go out into
the garden for ten minutes or so.  Give you time to
think things over.  Give me a hail."  He added
seriously "It'll make things so much easier for you if you
come out with the story in your own words."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Bond walked to the door into the garden.  He
turned around.  "I'm afraid it's only a question of
dotting the <i class="calibre3">i</i>'s and crossing the <i class="calibre3">t</i>'s.  You see I had a
talk with the Foo brothers in Kingston yesterday."  He
stepped out onto the lawn.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Something in Major Smythe was relieved.  Now at
least the battle of wits, the trying to invent alibis, the
evasions, were over.  If this man Bond had got to the
Foos, to either of them, they would have spilled
the beans.  The last thing they wanted was to get in
bad with the government, and anyway there was
only about six inches of the stuff left.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Major Smythe got briskly to his feet and went to
the loaded sideboard and poured himself out
another brandy and ginger ale, almost fifty-fifty.  He
might as well live it up while there was still time!
The future wouldn't hold many more of these for
him.  He went back to his chair and lit his twentieth
cigarette of the day.  He looked at his watch.  It said
eleven-thirty.  If he could be rid of the chap in an
hour, he'd have plenty of time with his "people."  He
sat and drank and marshaled his thoughts.  He could
make the story long or short, put in the weather and
the way the flowers and pines had smelled on the
mountain, or he could cut it short.  He would cut it
short.
</p>

<p class="calibre1"><br class="calibre4"/></p>

<p class="calibre1">
Up in that big double bedroom in the Tiefenbrünner,
with the wads of buff and gray paper
spread out on the spare bed, he hadn't been
looking for anything special, just taking samples here
and there and concentrating on the ones marked, in
red, KOMMANDOSACHE—HÖCHST VERTRAULICH.  There
weren't many of these, and they were mostly
confidential reports on German top brass, intercepts of
broken allied ciphers, and information about the
whereabouts of secret dumps.  Since these were the
main targets of "A" Force, Major Smythe had
scanned them with particular excitement—food,
explosives, guns, espionage records, files of Gestapo
personnel.  A tremendous haul!  And then, at the
bottom of the packet, there had been the single
envelope sealed with red wax and the notation ONLY
TO BE OPENED IN FINAL EMERGENCY.  The envelope
contained one single sheet of paper.  It was unsigned,
and the few words were written in red ink.  The
heading said VALUTA, and beneath it was written:
WILDE KAISER.  FRANZISKANER HALT.  100 M. ÖSTLICH
STEINHÜGEL.  WAFFENKISTE.  ZWEI BAR 24 KT.  Under
that was a list of measurements in centimeters.
Major Smythe held his hands apart as if telling a story
about a fish he had caught.  The bars would be about
as wide as his shoulders and about two by four
inches.  And one single English sovereign of only
eighteen carats was selling nowadays for two to three
pounds!  This was a bloody fortune!  Forty, fifty
thousand pounds worth!  Maybe even a hundred!  He
didn't stop to think, but, quite coolly and speedily,
in case anyone should come in, he put a match to the
paper and the envelope, ground the ashes to powder,
and swilled them down the lavatory.  Then he took
out his large-scale Austrian ordnance map of the area
and in a moment had his finger on the Franziskaner
Halt.  It was marked as an uninhabited mountaineers'
refuge on a saddle just below the highest of the
easterly peaks of the Kaiser mountains, that
awe-inspiring range of giant stone teeth that gave
Kitzbühel its threatening northern horizon.  And the
cairn of stones would be about there—his fingernail
pointed—and the whole bloody lot was only ten
miles and perhaps a five hours' climb away!
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The beginning had been as this fellow Bond had
described.  He had gone to Oberhauser's chalet at
four in the morning, had arrested him, and had told
his weeping, protesting family that Smythe was
taking him to an interrogation camp in Munich.  If the
guide's record was clean he would be back home
within a week.  If the family kicked up a fuss it would
only make trouble for Oberhauser.  Smythe had
refused to give his name and had had the forethought
to shroud the numbers on his jeep.  In twenty-four
hours, "A" Force would be on its way, and by the
time military government got to Kitzbühel, the
incident would already be buried under the morass of
the Occupation tangle.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Oberhauser had been a nice enough chap once he
had recovered from his fright, and when Smythe
talked knowingly about skiing and climbing, both of
which he had done before the war, the pair, as
Smythe intended, became quite pally.  Their route
lay along the bottom of the Kaiser range to Kufstein,
and Smythe drove slowly, making admiring comments
on the peaks that were now flushed with the
pink of dawn.  Finally, below the peak of gold, as he
called it to himself, he slowed to a halt and pulled off
the road into a grassy glade.  He turned in his seat
and said with an assumption of candor, "Oberhauser,
you are a man after my own heart.  We share
many interests together, and from your talk, and
from the man I think you to be, I am sure you did
not cooperate with the Nazis.  Now I will tell you
what I will do.  We will spend the day climbing on
the Kaiser, and I will then drive you back to
Kitzbühel and report to my commanding officer that you
have been cleared at Munich."  He grinned
cheerfully.  "Now.  How about that?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The man had been near to tears of gratitude.  But
could he have some kind of paper to show that he
was a good citizen?  Certainly.  Major Smythe's
signature would be quite enough.  The pact was made, the
jeep was driven up a track and well hidden from the
road, and they were off at a steady pace, climbing up
through the pine-scented foothills.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Smythe was well dressed for the climb.  He had
nothing on except his bush shirt, shorts, and a pair of
the excellent rubber-soled boots issued to American
parachutists.  His only burden was the Webley-Scott,
and, tactfully, for Oberhauser was after all one
of the enemy, Oberhauser didn't suggest that he
leave it behind some conspicuous rock.  Oberhauser
was in his best suit and boots, but that didn't seem to
bother him, and he assured Major Smythe that ropes
and pitons would not be needed for their climb and
that there was a hut directly up above them where
they could rest.  It was called the Franziskaner Halt.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Is it indeed?" said Major Smythe.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Yes, and below it there is a small glacier.  Very
pretty, but we will climb round it.  There are many
crevasses."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Is that so?" said Major Smythe thoughtfully.  He
examined the back of Oberhauser's head, now
beaded with sweat.  After all, he was only a bloody
kraut, or at any rate of that ilk.  What would one
more or less matter?  It was all going to be as easy as
falling off a log.  The only thing that worried Major
Smythe was getting the bloody stuff down the mountain.
He decided that he would somehow sling the
bars across his back.  After all, he could slide it most
of the way in its ammunition box or whatnot.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
It was a long, dreary hack up the mountain, and
when they were above the treeline, the sun came up
and it was very hot.  And now it was all rock and
scree, and their long zigzags sent boulders and
rubble rumbling and crashing down the slope that got
ever steeper as they approached the final crag, gray
and menacing, that lanced away into the blue above
them.  They were both naked to the waist and
sweating, so that the sweat ran down their legs into their
boots, but despite Oberhauser's limp, they kept up a
good pace, and when they stopped for a drink and a
swabdown at a hurtling mountain stream, Oberhauser
congratulated Major Smythe on his fitness.
Major Smythe, his mind full of dreams, said curtly
and untruthfully that all English soldiers were fit,
and they went on.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The rock face wasn't difficult.  Major Smythe had
known that it wouldn't be or the climbers' hut
couldn't have been built on the shoulder.  Toeholds
had been cut in the face, and there were occasional
iron pegs hammered into crevices.  But he couldn't
have found the more difficult traverses by himself,
and he congratulated himself on deciding to bring a
guide.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Once, Oberhauser's hand, testing for a grip,
dislodged a great slab of rock, loosened by five years of
snow and frost, and sent it crashing down the
mountain.  Major Smythe suddenly thought about noise.
"Many people around here?" he asked as they
watched the boulder hurtle down into the treeline.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Not a soul until you get near Kufstein," said
Oberhauser.  He gestured along the arid range of
high peaks.  "No grazing.  Little water.  Only the
climbers come here.  And since the beginning of the
war...."  He left the phrase unfinished.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
They skirted the blue-fanged glacier below the
final climb to the shoulder.  Major Smythe's careful
eyes took in the width and depth of the crevasses.
Yes, they would fit!  Directly above them, perhaps a
hundred feet up under the lee of the shoulder, were
the weatherbeaten boards of the hut.  Major Smythe
measured the angle of the slope.  Yes, it was almost a
straight dive down.  Now or later?  He guessed later.
The line of the last traverse wasn't very clear.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
They were up at the hut in five hours flat.  Major
Smythe said he wanted to relieve himself and wandered
casually along the shoulder to the east, paying
no heed to the beautiful panoramas of Austria and
Bavaria that stretched away on either side of him
perhaps fifty miles into the heat haze.  He counted
his paces carefully.  At exactly one hundred and
twenty there was the cairn of stones, a loving
memorial perhaps to some long dead climber.  Major
Smythe, knowing differently, longed to tear it apart
there and then.  Instead he took out his Webley-Scott,
squinted down the barrel, and twirled the
cylinder.  Then he walked back.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
It was cold up there at ten thousand feet or more,
and Oberhauser had got into the hut and was busy
preparing a fire.  Major Smythe controlled his horror
at the sight.  "Oberhauser," he said cheerfully, "come
out and show me some of the sights.  Wonderful view
up here."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Certainly, Major."  Oberhauser followed Major
Smythe out of the hut.  Outside, he fished in his hip
pocket and produced something wrapped in paper.
He undid the paper to reveal a hard wrinkled
sausage.  He offered it to the major.  "It is only what we
call a Soldat," he said shyly.  "Smoked meat.  Very
tough but good."  He smiled.  "It is like what they eat
in Wild West films.  What is the name?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Pemmican," said the major.  Then—and later
this had slightly disgusted him with himself—he
said, "Leave it in the hut.  We will share it later.
Come over here.  Can we see Innsbruck?  Show me
the view on this side."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Oberhauser bobbed into the hut and out again.
The major fell in just behind him as he talked,
pointing out this or that distant church spire or
mountain peak.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
They came to the point above the glacier.  Major
Smythe drew his revolver, and at a range of two feet,
fired two bullets into the base of Hannes
Oberhauser's skull.  No muffing!  Dead-on!
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The impact of the bullets knocked the guide clean
off his feet and over the edge.  Major Smythe craned
over.  The body hit twice only, and then crashed onto
the glacier.  But not onto its fissured origin.  Halfway
down and on a patch of old snow!  "Hell!" said Major
Smythe.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The deep boom of the two shots, which had been
batting to and fro among the mountains, died away.
Major Smythe took one last look at the black splash
on the white snow and hurried off along the
shoulder.  First things first!
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
He started on the top of the cairn, working as if
the devil were after him, throwing the rough, heavy
stones indiscriminately down the mountain to right
or left.  His hands began to bleed, but he hardly
noticed.  Now there were only two feet or so left, and
nothing!  Bloody nothing!  He bent to the last pile,
scrabbling feverishly.  And then!  Yes!  The edge of a
metal box.  A few more rocks away, and there was the
whole of it!  A good old gray Wehrmacht ammunition
box with the trace of some lettering still on it.
Major Smythe gave a groan of joy.  He sat down on
a hard piece of rock, and his mind went orbiting
through Bentleys, Monte Carlo, penthouse flats,
Cartier's, champagne, caviar, and, incongruously
(but because he loved golf), a new set of Henry
Cotton irons.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Drunk with his dreams, Major Smythe sat there
looking at the gray box for a full quarter of an hour.
Then he looked at his watch and got briskly to his
feet.  Time to get rid of the evidence.  The box had a
handle at each end.  Major Smythe had expected it to
be heavy.  He had mentally compared its probable
weight with the heaviest thing he had ever carried—a
forty-pound salmon he had caught in Scotland just
before the war—but the box was certainly double
that weight, and he was only just able to lift it out of
its last bed of rocks onto the thin alpine grass.  Then
he slung his handkerchief through one of the
handles and dragged it clumsily along the shoulder to
the hut.  Then he sat down on the stone doorstep,
and, his eyes never leaving the box, he tore at
Oberhauser's smoked sausage with his strong teeth and
thought about getting his fifty thousand pounds—for
that was the figure he put it at—down the
mountain and into a new hiding place.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Oberhauser's sausage was a real mountaineer's
meal—tough, well-fatted, and strongly garlicked.
Bits of it stuck uncomfortably between Major
Smythe's teeth.  He dug them out with a sliver of
matchstick and spat them on the ground.  Then his
Intelligence-wise mind came into operation, and he
meticulously searched among the stones and grass,
picked up the scraps, and swallowed them.  From
now on he was a criminal—as much a criminal as if
he had robbed a bank and shot the guard.  He was a
cop turned robber.  He must remember that!  It
would be death if he didn't—death instead of
Cartier's.  All he had to do was to take infinite pains.  He
would take those pains, and by God they would be
infinite!  Then, for ever after, he would be rich and
happy.  After taking ridiculously minute trouble to
eradicate any sign of entry into the hut, he dragged
the ammunition box to the edge of the last rock face
and, aiming it away from the glacier, tipped it, with
a prayer, into space.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The gray box, turning slowly in the air, hit the
first steep slope below the rock face, bounded another
hundred feet, and landed with an iron clang in some
loose scree and stopped.  Major Smythe couldn't see
if it had burst open.  He didn't mind one way or the
other.  He had tried to open it without success.  Let
the mountain do it for him!
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
With a last look around, he went over the edge.
He took great care at each piton, tested each
handhold and foothold before he put his weight on it.
Coming down, he was a much more valuable life
than he had been climbing up.  He made for the
glacier and trudged across the melting snow to the
black patch on the icefield.  There was nothing to be
done about footprints.  It would take only a few days
for them to be melted down by the sun.  He got to
the body.  He had seen many corpses during the war,
and the blood and broken limbs meant nothing to
him.  He dragged the remains of Oberhauser to the
nearest deep crevasse and toppled it in.  Then he
went carefully around the lip of the crevasse and
kicked the snow overhang down on top of the body.
Then, satisfied with his work, he retraced his steps,
placing his feet exactly in his old footprints, and
made his way on down the slope to the ammunition box.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Yes, the mountain had burst open the lid for him.
Almost casually he tore away the cartridge-paper
wrappings.  The two great hunks of metal glittered
up at him under the sun.  There were the same markings
on each—the swastika in a circle below an eagle,
and the date 1943—the mint marks of the Reichsbank.
Major Smythe gave a nod of approval.  He replaced
the paper and hammered the crooked lid half-shut
with a rock.  Then he tied the lanyard of his
Webley around one of the handles and moved on
down the mountain, dragging his clumsy burden
behind him.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
It was now one o'clock, and the sun beat fiercely
down on his naked chest, frying him in his own
sweat.  His reddened shoulders began to burn.  So
did his face.  To hell with them!  He stopped at the
stream from the glacier, dipped his handkerchief in
the water, and tied it across his forehead.  Then he
drank deeply and went on, occasionally cursing the
ammunition box as it caught up with him and
banged at his heels.  But these discomforts, the
sunburn and the bruises, were nothing compared with
what he would have to face when he got down to
the valley and the going leveled out.  For the time
being he had gravity on his side.  There would come
at least a mile when he would have to carry the
blasted stuff.  Major Smythe winced at the thought of
the havoc the eighty pounds or so would wreak on
his burned back.  "Oh well," he said to himself
almost lightheadedly, "<i class="calibre3">il faut souffrir pour être
millionaire!</i>"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
When he got to the bottom and the time had
come, he sat and rested on a mossy bank under the
firs.  Then he spread out his bush shirt and heaved
the two bars out of the box and onto its center and
tied the tails of the shirt as firmly as he could to
where the sleeves sprang from the shoulders.  After
digging a shallow hole in the bank and burying the
empty box, he knotted the two cuffs of the sleeves
firmly together, knelt down and slipped his head
through the rough sling, got his hands on either side
of the knot to protect his neck, and staggered to his
feet, crouching far forward so as not to be pulled
over on his back.  Then, crushed under half his own
weight, his back on fire under the contact with his
burden, and his breath rasping through his constricted
lungs, coolie-like, he shuffled slowly off down
the little path through the trees.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
To this day he didn't know how he had made it to
the jeep.  Again and again the knots gave under the
strain and the bars crashed down on the calves of his
legs, and each time he had sat with his head in his
hands and then started all over again.  But finally, by
concentrating on counting his steps and stopping for
a rest at every hundredth, he got to the blessed little
jeep and collapsed beside it.  And then there had
been the business of burying his hoard in the wood,
amongst a jumble of big rocks that he would be sure
to find again, of cleaning himself up as best he could,
and of getting back to his billet by a circuitous route
that avoided the Oberhauser chalet.  And then it was
all done, and he had got drunk by himself off a
bottle of cheap schnapps and eaten and gone to bed and
fallen into a stupefied sleep.  The next day, MOB
"A" Force had moved off up the Mittersill valley on
a fresh trail, and six months later Major Smythe was
back in London and his war was over.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
But not his problems.  Gold is difficult stuff to
smuggle, certainly in the quantity available to Major
Smythe, and it was now essential to get his two bars
across the Channel and into a new hiding place.  So
he put off his demobilization and clung to the red
tabs of his temporary rank, and particularly to his
Military Intelligence passes, and soon got himself
sent back to Germany as a British representative at
the Combined Interrogation Center in Munich.
There he did a scratch job for six months, during
which, on a weekend's leave, he collected his gold
and stowed it away in a battered suitcase in his
quarters.  Then he resigned his post and flew back to
England, carrying the two bars in a bulky briefcase.  The
hundred yards across the tarmac at each end of the
flight, and the handling of his case as if it contained
only papers, required two benzedrine tablets and a
will of iron, but at last he had his fortune safe in the
basement of an aunt's flat in Kensington and could
get on with the next phase of his plans at leisure.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
He resigned from the Royal Marines and got
himself demobilized and married one of the many girls
he had slept with at MOB Force Headquarters, a
charming blonde Wren from a solid middle-class
family named Mary Parnell.  He got passages for
them both in one of the early banana boats sailing
from Avonmouth to Kingston, Jamaica, which they
both agreed would be a paradise of sunshine, good
food, cheap drink, and a glorious haven from the
gloom and restrictions and Labour Government of
postwar England.  Before they sailed, Major Smythe
showed Mary the gold bars from which he had
chiseled away the mint marks of the Reichsbank.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"I've been clever, darling," he said.  "I just don't
trust the pound these days, so I've sold out all my
securities and swapped the lot for gold.  Must be
about fifty thousand pounds' worth there.  That
should give us twenty-five years of the good life, just
cutting off a slice now and then and selling it."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Mary Parnell was not to know that such a transaction
was impossible under the currency laws.  She
knelt down and ran her hands lovingly over the
gleaming bars.  Then she got up and threw her arms
around Major Smythe's neck and kissed him.
"You're a wonderful, wonderful man," she said,
almost in tears.  "Frightfully clever and handsome and
brave, and now I find out that you're rich as well.
I'm the luckiest girl in the world."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Well, anyway we're rich," said Major Smythe.
"But promise me you won't breathe a word, or we'll
have all the burglars in Jamaica around our ears.
Promise?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Cross my heart."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Prince's Club, in the foothills above Kingston, was
indeed a paradise.  Pleasant enough members,
wonderful servants, unlimited food, cheap drink—and
all in the wonderful setting of the tropics, which
neither of them had known before.  They were a
popular couple, and Major Smythe's war record earned
them the entrée to Government House society, after
which their life was one endless round of parties,
with tennis for Mary and golf (with the Henry
Cotton irons!) for Major Smythe.  In the evenings there
was bridge for her and the high poker game for him.
Yes, it was paradise all right, while in their
homeland people munched their Spam, fiddled in the
black market, cursed the government, and suffered
the worst winter's weather for thirty years.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The Smythes met all their initial expenditures
from their combined cash reserves, swollen by
war-time gratuities, and it took Major Smythe a full year
of careful sniffing around before he decided to do
business with the Messrs. Foo, import and export
merchants.  The brothers Foo, highly respected and
very rich, were the acknowledged governing junta of
the flourishing Chinese community in Jamaica.
Some of their trading was suspected to be devious—in
the Chinese tradition—but all Major Smythe's
casually meticulous inquiries confirmed that they
were utterly trustworthy.  The Bretton Woods Convention,
fixing a controlled world price for gold, had
been signed, and it had already become common
knowledge that Tangier and Macao were two free
ports that, for different reasons, had escaped the
Bretton Woods net; there a price of at least one
hundred dollars per ounce of gold, ninety-nine fine,
could be obtained, compared with the fixed world
price of thirty-five dollars per ounce.  And,
conveniently, the Foos had just begun to trade again with
a resurgent Hong Kong, already the port of entry for
gold smuggling into the neighboring Macao.  The
whole setup was, in Major Smythe's language,
"ticketty-boo."  He had a most pleasant meeting with the
Foo brothers.  No questions were asked until it came
to examining the bars.  At this point the absence of
mint marks resulted in a polite inquiry as to the
original provenance of the gold.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"You see, Major," said the older and blander of
the brothers behind the big bare mahogany desk, "in
the bullion market the mint marks of all respectable
national banks and responsible dealers are accepted
without question.  Such marks guarantee the fineness
of the gold.  But of course there are other banks and
dealers whose methods of refining"—his benign
smile widened a fraction—"are perhaps not quite,
shall we say, so accurate."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"You mean the old gold brick swindle?" asked
Major Smythe with a twinge of anxiety.  "Hunk of
lead covered with gold plating?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Both brothers tee-heed reassuringly.  "No, no,
Major.  That of course is out of the question.  But"—the
smiles held constant—"if you cannot recall the
provenance of these fine bars, perhaps you would have no
objections if we were to undertake an assay.  There
are methods of determining the exact fineness of
such bars.  My brother and I are competent in these
methods.  If you would care to leave these with us
and perhaps come back after lunch...?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
There had been no alternative.  Major Smythe had
to trust the Foos utterly now.  They could cook up
any figure, and he would just have to accept it.  He
went over to the Myrtle Bank and had one or two
stiff drinks and a sandwich that stuck in his throat.
Then he went back to the cool office of the Foos.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The setting was the same—the two smiling brothers,
the two bars of gold, the briefcase—but now
there was a piece of paper and a gold Parker pen in
front of the older brother.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"We have solved the problem of your fine bars,
Major——"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"<i class="calibre3">Fine</i>!  Thank God," thought Major Smythe.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"——And I am sure you will be interested to
know their probable history."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Yes indeed," said Major Smythe, with a brave
show of enthusiasm.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"They are German bars, Major.  Probably from
the wartime Reichsbank.  This we have deduced
from the fact that they contain ten percent of lead.
Under the Hitler regime, it was the foolish habit of
the Reichsbank to adulterate their gold in this
manner.  This fact rapidly became known to dealers, and
the price of German bars, in Switzerland for
instance, where many of them found their way, was
adjusted downward accordingly.  So the only result of
the German foolishness was that the national bank
of Germany lost a reputation for honest dealing it
had earned over the centuries."  The Oriental's smile
didn't vary.  "Very bad business, Major.  Very stupid."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Major Smythe marveled at the omniscience of
these two men so far from the great commercial
channels of the world, but he also cursed it.  <i class="calibre3">Now
what</i>?  He said, "That's very interesting, Mr. Foo.
But it is not very good news for me.  Are these bars
not 'Good delivery,' or whatever you call it in the
bullion world?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The older Foo made a slight throwaway gesture
with his right hand.  "It is of no importance, Major.
Or rather, it is of very small importance.  We will sell
your gold at its true mint value, let us say,
eighty-nine fine.  It may be re-fined by the ultimate
purchaser, or it may not.  That is not our business.  We
shall have sold a true bill of goods."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"But at a lower price."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"That is so, Major.  But I think I have some good
news for you.  Have you any estimate as to the worth
of these two bars?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"I thought around fifty thousand pounds."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The older Foo gave a dry chuckle.  "I think—if we
sell wisely and slowly—you should receive one
hundred thousand pounds, Major, subject that is, to our
commission, which will include shipping and
incidental charges."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"How much would that be?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"We were thinking about a figure of ten percent,
Major.  If that is satisfactory to you."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Major Smythe had an idea that bullion brokers
received a fraction of one percent.  But what the hell?
He had already as good as made forty thousand
pounds since lunch.  He said "Done" and got up and
reached his hand across the desk.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
From then on, every quarter, he would visit the
office of the Foos carrying an empty suitcase.  On the
broad desk there would be one thousand new
Jamaican pounds in neat bundles and the two gold bars,
which diminished inch by inch, together with a
typed slip showing the amount sold and the price
obtained in Macao.  It was all very simple and
friendly and highly businesslike, and Major Smythe
didn't think that he was being submitted to any
form of squeeze other than the duly recorded ten
percent.  In any case, he didn't particularly care.
Four thousand net a year was good enough for him,
and his only worry was that the income tax people
would get after him and ask him what he was living
on.  He mentioned this possibility to the Foos.  But
they said he was not to worry, and for the next four
quarters, there was only nine hundred pounds
instead of a thousand on the table and no comment
was made by either side.  Squeeze had been
administered in the right quarter.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
And so the lazy, sunshiny days passed by for fifteen
happy years.  The Smythes both put on weight, and
Major Smythe had the first of his two coronaries and
was told by his doctor to cut down on his alcohol
and cigarettes, to take life more easily, to avoid fats
and fried food.  Mary Smythe tried to be firm with
him, but when he took to secret drinking and to a
life of petty lies and evasions, she tried to backpedal
on her attempts to control his self-indulgence.  But
she was too late.  She had already become the symbol
of the caretaker to Major Smythe, and he took to
avoiding her.  She berated him with not loving her
anymore.  And when the continual bickering became
too much for her simple nature, she became a
sleeping pill addict.  And one night, after one flaming
drunken row, she took an overdose—"just to show
him."  It was too much of an overdose and it killed
her.  The suicide was hushed up, but the cloud did
Major Smythe no good socially, and he retreated to
the North Shore, which, although only some thirty
miles across the island from the capital, is, even in
the small society of Jamaica, a different world.  And
there he had settled in Wavelets and, after his second
coronary, was in the process of drinking himself to
death when this man named Bond arrived on the
scene with an alternative death warrant in his
pocket.
</p>

<p class="calibre1"><br class="calibre4"/></p>

<p class="calibre1">
Major Smythe looked at his watch.  It was a few
minutes after twelve o'clock.  He got up and poured
himself another stiff brandy and ginger ale and went
out onto the lawn.  James Bond was sitting under the
sea almonds gazing out to sea.  He didn't look up
when Major Smythe pulled up another aluminum
garden chair and put his drink on the grass beside
him.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
When Major Smythe had finished telling his story,
Bond said unemotionally, "Yes, that's more or less
the way I figured it."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Want me to write it all out and sign it?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"You can if you like.  But not for me.  That'll be
for the court-martial.  Your old corps will be
handling all that.  I've got nothing to do with the legal
aspects.  I shall put in a report to my own Service of
what you've told me, and they'll pass it on to the
Royal Marines.  Then I suppose it'll go to the Public
Prosecutor via Scotland Yard."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Could I ask a question?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Of course."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"How did they find out?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"It was a small glacier.  Oberhauser's body came
out at the bottom of it earlier this year.  When the
spring snows melted.  Some climbers found it.  All his
papers and everything were intact.  His family
identified him.  Then it was just a question of working
back.  The bullets clinched it."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"But how did you get mixed up in the whole thing?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"MOB Force was a responsibility of my, er, Service.
The papers found their way to us.  I happened
to see the file.  I had some spare time on my hands.  I
asked to be given the job of chasing up the man who
did it."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Why?"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
James Bond looked Major Smythe squarely in the
eyes.  "It just happened that Oberhauser was a friend
of mine.  He taught me to ski before the war, when I
was in my teens.  He was a wonderful man.  He was
something of a father to me at a time when I
happened to need one."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Oh, I see."  Major Smythe looked away.  "I'm sorry."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
James Bond got to his feet.  "Well, I'll be getting
back to Kingston."  He held up a hand.  "No, don't
bother.  I'll find my way to the car."  He looked down
at the older man.  He said abruptly, almost
harshly—perhaps, Major Smythe thought, to hide his
embarrassment—"It'll be about a week before they send
someone out to bring you home."  Then he walked
off across the lawn and through the house, and
Major Smythe heard the iron whirr of the self-starter
and the clatter of the gravel on the unkempt drive.
</p>

<p class="calibre1"><br class="calibre4"/></p>

<p class="calibre1">
Major Smythe, questing for his prey along the
reef, wondered what exactly those last words of the
Bond man had meant.  Inside the Pirelli his lips drew
mirthlessly back from the stained teeth.  It was obvious,
really.  It was just a version of the corny old act
of leaving the guilty officer alone with his revolver.
If the Bond man had wanted to, he could have
telephoned Government House and had an officer of the
Jamaica Regiment sent over to take Major Smythe
into custody.  Decent of him, in a way.  Or was it?  A
suicide would be tidier, save a lot of paperwork and
taxpayers' money.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Should he oblige the Bond man and be tidy?  Join
Mary in whatever place suicides go to?  Or go
through with it—the indignity, the dreary
formalities, the headlines, the boredom and drabness of a
life sentence that would inevitably end with his
third coronary?  Or should he defend himself—plead
wartime, a struggle with Oberhauser, prisoner trying
to escape, Oberhauser knowing of the gold cache, the
natural temptation of Smythe to make away with the
bullion, he, a poor officer of the commandos
confronted with sudden wealth?
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Should he dramatically throw himself on the
mercy of the court?  Suddenly Major Smythe saw
himself in the dock—a splendid, upright figure, in
the fine bemedaled blue and scarlet of the ceremonial
uniform that was the traditional rig for
court-martial.  (Had the moths got into the japanned box
in the spare room at Wavelets?  Had the damp?  Luna
would have to look to it.)  A day in the sunshine, if
the weather held.  A good brushing.  With the help of
his corset, he could surely still get his forty-inch
waist into the thirty-four-inch trousers Gieves had
made for him twenty, thirty, years ago.  And, down
on the floor of the court, at Chatham probably, the
Prisoners' Friend, some staunch fellow, at least of
colonel's rank in deference to his own seniority,
would be pleading his cause.  And there was always
the possibility of appeal to a higher court.  Why, the
whole affair might become a cause célèbre ... he
would sell his story to the papers, write a book....
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Major Smythe felt the excitement mounting in
him.  Careful, old boy!  Careful!  Remember what the
good old snip-cock had said!  He put his feet to the
ground and had a rest amidst the dancing waves of
the northeast trades that kept the North Shore so
delightfully cool until the torrid months—August,
September, October—of the hurricane season.  He
would soon be having his two pink gins, skimpy
lunch, and happily sodden siesta, after which he
would have to give all this more careful thought.
And then there were cocktails with the Arundels and
dinner at the Shaw Park Beach Club with the
Marchesis.  Then some high bridge and home to his
Seconal sleep.  Cheered by the prospect of the familiar
routine, the black shadow of Bond retreated into the
background.  Now then, scorp, where are you?  Octopussy's
waiting for her lunch!  Major Smythe put his
head down, and his mind freshly focused and his eyes
questing, continued his leisurely swim along the
shallow valley between the coral clumps that led out
toward the white-fringed reef.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Almost at once he saw the two spiny antennae of a
lobster, or rather of its cousin, the West Indian
langouste, weaving inquisitively toward him, toward
the turbulence he was creating, from a deep fissure
under a coral boulder.  From the thickness of the
antennae, it would be a big one, three or four pounds!
Normally, Major Smythe would have put his feet
down and delicately stirred up the sand in front of
the lair to bring the lobster farther out, for they are
an inquisitive family.  Then he would have speared it
through the head and taken it back for lunch.  But
today there was only one prey in his mind, one shape
to concentrate on—the shaggy, irregular silhouette
of a scorpionfish.  And, ten minutes later, he saw a
clump of seaweedy rock on the white sand that
wasn't just a clump of seaweedy rock.  He put his feet
softly down and watched the poison spines erect
themselves along the back of the thing.  It was a
good-sized one, perhaps three-quarters of a pound.  He got
his three-pronged spear ready and inched forward.
Now the red angry eyes of the fish were wide open
and watching him.  He would have to make a single
quick lunge from as nearly the vertical as possible;
otherwise, he knew from experience, the barbed
prongs, needle-sharp though they were, would
almost certainly bounce off the horny head of the
beast.  He swung his feet up off the ground and
paddled forward very slowly, using his free hand as a fin.
Now!  He lunged forward and downward.  But the
scorpionfish had felt the tiny approaching shock-wave
of the spear.  There was flurry of sand, and it
had shot up in a vertical takeoff and whirred, in
almost birdlike flight, under Major Smythe's belly.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Major Smythe cursed and twisted around in the
water.  Yes, it had done what the scorpionfish so often
does—gone for refuge to the nearest algae-covered
rock, and there, confident in its superb camouflage,
gone to ground on the seaweed.  Major Smythe had
only to swim a few feet, lunge down again, this time
more accurately, and he had it, flapping and
squirming on the end of his spear.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The excitement and the small exertion had caused
Major Smythe to pant, and he felt the old pain across
his chest lurking, ready to come at him.  He put his
feet down, and after driving his spear all the way
through the fish, held it, still flapping desperately,
out of the water.  Then he slowly made his way back
across the lagoon on foot and walked up the sand of
his beach to the wooden bench under the sea-grape.
Then he dropped the spear with its jerking quarry
on the sand beside him and sat down to rest.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
It was perhaps five minutes later that Major
Smythe felt a curious numbness more or less in the
region of his solar plexus.  He looked casually down,
and his whole body stiffened with horror and disbelief.
A patch of his skin, about the size of a cricket
ball, had turned white under his tan, and, in the
center of the patch, there were three punctures, one
below the other, topped by little beads of blood.
Automatically, Major Smythe wiped away the blood.
The holes were only the size of pinpricks.  Major
Smythe remembered the rising flight of the
scorpionfish, and he said aloud, with awe in his voice,
but without animosity, "You got me, you bastard!
By God, you got me!"
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
He sat very still, looking down at his body and
remembering what it said about scorpionfish stings in
the book he had borrowed from the Institute and
had never returned—<i class="calibre3">Dangerous Marine Animals</i>,
an American publication.  He delicately touched and
then prodded the white area around the punctures.
Yes, the skin had gone totally numb, and now a
pulse of pain began to throb beneath it.  Very soon
this would become a shooting pain.  Then the pain
would begin to lance all over his body and become so
intense that he would throw himself on the sand,
screaming and thrashing about, to rid himself of it.
He would vomit and foam at the mouth, and then
delirium and convulsions would take over until he
lost consciousness.  Then, inevitably in his case, there
would ensue cardiac failure and death.  According to
the book the whole cycle would be complete in
about a quarter of an hour—that was all he had
left—fifteen minutes of hideous agony!  There were
cures, of course—procaine, antibiotics and
antihistamines—if his weak heart would stand them.  But
they had to be near at hand.  Even if he could climb
the steps up to the house, and supposing Dr. Cahusac
had these modern drugs, the doctor couldn't
possibly get to Wavelets in under an hour.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The first jet of pain seared into Major Smythe's
body and bent him over double.  Then came another
and another, radiating through his stomach and
limbs.  Now there was a dry, metallic taste in his
mouth, and his lips were prickling.  He gave a groan
and toppled off the seat onto the beach.  A flapping
on the sand beside his head reminded him of the
scorpionfish.  There came a lull in the spasms of pain.
Instead, his whole body felt as though it was on fire,
but, beneath the agony, his brain cleared.  But of
course!  The experiment!  Somehow, somehow he
must get out to Octopussy and give her her lunch!
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
"Oh Pussy, my Pussy, this is the last meal you'll get."
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Major Smythe mouthed the refrain to himself as
he crouched on all fours, found his mask, and struggled
to force it over his face.  Then he got hold of his
spear, tipped with the still flapping fish, and
clutching his stomach with his free hand, crawled and
slithered down the sand and into the water.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
It was fifty yards of shallow water to the lair of the
octopus in the coral cranny, and Major Smythe,
screaming all the while into his mask, crawling
mostly on his knees, somehow made it.  As he came to
the last approach and the water became deeper, he
had to get to his feet, and the pain made him jiggle
to and fro, as if he were a puppet manipulated by
strings.  Then he was there, and with a supreme
effort of will, he held himself steady as he dipped his
head down to let some water into his mask and clear
the mist of his screams from the glass.  Then, blood
pouring from his bitten lower lip, he bent carefully
down to look into Octopussy's house.  Yes!  The
brown mass was still there.  It was stirring excitedly.
Why?  Major Smythe saw the dark strings of his
blood curling lazily down through the water.  Of
course!  The darling was tasting his blood.  A shaft of
pain hit Major Smythe and sent him reeling.  He
heard himself babbling deliriously into his mask.
<i class="calibre3">Pull yourself together, Dexter, old boy!  You've got
to give Pussy her lunch!</i>  He steadied himself, and
holding the spear well down the shaft, lowered the
fish down toward the writhing hole.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Would Pussy take the bait?  The poisonous bait
that was killing Major Smythe but to which an
octopus might be immune?  If only Bengry could be here
to watch!  Three tentacles, weaving excitedly, came
out of the hole and wavered around the scorpionfish.
Now there was a gray mist in front of Major
Smythe's eyes.  He recognized it as the edge of
unconsciousness and feebly shook his head to clear it.  And
then the tentacles leaped!  But not at the fish!  At
Major Smythe's hand and arm.  Major Smythe's torn
mouth stretched in a grimace of pleasure.  Now he
and Pussy had shaken hands!  How exciting!  How
truly wonderful!
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
But then the octopus, quietly, relentlessly pulled
downward, and terrible realization came to Major
Smythe.  He summoned his dregs of strength and
plunged his spear down.  The only effect was to push
the scorpionfish into the mass of the octopus and
offer more arm to the octopus.  The tentacles snaked
upward and pulled more relentlessly.  Too late,
Major Smythe scrabbled away his mask.  One bottled
scream burst out across the empty bay, then his head
went under and down, and there was an explosion of
bubbles to the surface.  Then Major Smythe's legs
came up and the small waves washed his body to and
fro while the octopus explored his right hand with
its buccal orifice and took a first tentative bite at a
finger with its beaklike jaws.
</p>

<p class="calibre1"><br class="calibre4"/></p>

<p class="calibre1">
The body was found by two young Jamaicans
spinning for needlefish from a canoe.  They speared
the octopus with Major Smythe's spear, killed it in
the traditional fashion by turning it inside out and
biting its head off, and brought the three corpses
home.  They turned Major Smythe's body over to the
police, and had the scorpionfish and the seacat for
supper.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
The local correspondent of the <i class="calibre3">Daily Gleaner</i>
reported that Major Smythe had been killed by an
octopus, but the paper translated this into "found
drowned" so as not to frighten away the tourists.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
Later, in London, James Bond, privately assuming
"suicide," wrote the same verdict of "found
drowned," together with the date, on the last page
and closed the bulky file.
</p>

<p class="calibre1">
It is only from the notes of Dr. Cahusac, who
performed the autopsy, that it has been possible to
construct some kind of a postscript to the bizarre and
pathetic end of a once valuable officer of the Secret
Service.
