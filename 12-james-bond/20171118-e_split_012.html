<p class="line8"><span class="sc">Dikko Henderson</span> came to fetch Bond at ten o’clock
next morning. He was considerably overhung. The hard
blue eyes were veined with blood, and he made straight
for the Bamboo Bar and ordered himself a double brandy
and ginger ale. Bond said mildly, “You shouldn’t have
poured all that <span class="it">saké</span> on top of the Suntory. I can’t believe
Japanese whisky makes a good foundation for anything.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You’ve got something there, sport. I’ve got myself a
proper <span class="it">futsuka-yoi</span>—honourable hangover. Mouth like a
vulture’s crutch. Soon as we got home from that lousy
cat house, I had to go for the big spit. But you’re wrong
about Suntory. It’s a good enough brew. Stick to the
cheapest, the White Label, at around fifteen bob a bottle.
There are two smarter brands, but the cheap one’s the
best. Went up to the distillery some whiles ago and met
one of the family. Told me an interesting thing about
whisky. He said you can only make good whisky where
you can take good photographs. Ever heard that one? Said
it was something to do with the effect of clear light on
the alcohol. But did I talk a lot of crap last night? Or did
you? Seem to recollect that one of us did.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You only gave me hell about the state of the world
and called me a poofter. But you were quite friendly
about it. No offence given or taken.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh Christ!” Dikko Henderson gloomily pushed a hand
through his tough grizzled hair. “But I didn’t hit anyone?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Only that girl you slapped so hard on the bottom that
she fell down.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Oh that!” said Dikko Henderson with relief. “That
was just a love-pat. What’s a girl’s bottom for, anyway?
And so far as I recall, they all screamed with laughter.
Including her. Right? How did you make out with yours
by the way? She looked pretty enthusiastic.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“She was.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Good show.” He swallowed the remains of his drink
and got to his feet. “Come on, bud. Let’s go. Wouldn’t
do to keep Tiger waiting. I once did, and he wouldn’t
speak to me for a week.”</p>

<p class="pindent">It was a typical Tokyo day in late summer—hot, sticky,
and grey—the air full of fine dust from the endless demolition
and reconstruction work. They drove for half an
hour towards Yokohama and pulled up outside a dull grey
building which announced itself in large letters to be the
“Bureau of All-Asian Folkways.” There was a busy traffic
of Japanese scurrying in and out through the bogusly important-looking
entrance, but no one glanced at Dikko
and Bond, and they were not asked their business as Dikko
led the way through an entrance hall where there were
books and postcards on sale as if the place were some kind
of museum. Dikko made for a doorway marked “Co-ordination
Department,” and there was a long corridor with
open rooms on both sides. The rooms were full of studious-looking
young men at desks. There were large wall maps
with coloured pins dotted across them, and endless shelves
of books. A door marked “International Relations” gave
on to another corridor, this time lined with closed doors
which had people’s names on them in English and Japanese.
A sharp right turn took them through the “Visual
Presentation Bureau” with more closed doors, and on to
“Documentation,” a large hall-shaped library with more
people bent over desks. Here, for the first time, they were
scrutinized by a man at a desk near the entrance. He rose
to his feet and bowed wordlessly. As they walked on
Dikko said quietly, “This is where the cover tapers off.
Up till now, all those people really were researching Asian
folkways. But these here are part of Tiger’s outside staff,
doing more or less classified work. Sort of archivists. This
is where we’d be politely turned back if we’d lost our
way.” Behind a final wall of bookshelves that stretched out
into the room, a small door was concealed. It was marked
<span class="sc">proposed extension to documentation department.
danger! construction work in progress.</span> From behind
it came the sound of drills, a circular saw cutting
through wood, and other building noises. Dikko walked
through the door into a totally empty room with a highly
polished wood floor. There was no sign of construction
work. Dikko laughed at Bond’s surprise. He gestured
towards a large metal box fitted to the back of the door
through which they had come. “Tape recorder,” he said.
“Clever gimmick. Sounds just like the real thing. And this”—he
pointed to the stretch of bare floor ahead—“is what
the Japanese call a ‘nightingale floor.’ Relic of the old days
when people wanted to be warned of intruders. Serves the
same purpose here. Imagine trying to get across here without
being heard.” They set off, and immediately the cunningly
sprung boards gave out penetrating squeaks and
groans. In a small facing door, a spy-hole slid open and
one large eye surveyed them. The door opened to reveal a
stocky man in plain clothes who had been sitting at a small
deal table reading a book. It was a tiny box-like room that
seemed to have no other exit. The man bowed. Dikko said
some phrases containing the words “Tanaka-san.” The
man bowed again. Dikko turned to Bond. “You’re on your
own now. Be in it, champ! Tiger’ll send you back to your
hotel. See you.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said, “Tell mother I died game,” and walked into
the little box. The door was closed behind him. There was
a row of buttons by the desk, and the guard pressed one
of them. There came a barely perceptible whine, and Bond
got the impression of descent. So the room was a lift. What
a box of tricks the formidable Tiger had erected as a screen
for himself! The authentic Eastern nest of boxes. What
next?</p>

<p class="pindent">The descent continued for some time. When it stopped,
the guard opened the door and Bond stepped out and stood
stock still. He was standing on the platform of an underground
station! There it all was: the red and green signals
over the two yawning tunnels, the conventional white tiles
on the walls, and the curved roof—even an empty cigarette
kiosk let into the wall beside him! A man had come out of
this. He now said in good English, “Please to follow me,
Commander,” and led the way through an arch marked
<span class="sc">exit</span>. But here all the floor space of the hall that would
one day lead to the moving stairways was occupied by trim
prefabricated offices on both sides of a wide corridor. Bond
was led into the first of these, which revealed itself as a
waiting-room and outer office. A male secretary rose from
his typewriter, bowed, and went through a communicating
door. He immediately reappeared, bowed again, and held
the door open. “Please come this way, Commander.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond went through, and the door was softly closed behind
him. The big square figure that Dikko had described
to him came forward across the handsome red carpet and
held out a hand that was hard and dry. “My dear Commander.
Good morning. It is a great pleasure to meet you.”
The wide gold-toothed smile signalled welcome. The eyes
glittered between long dark lashes that were almost feminine.
“Come and sit down. How do you like my offices?
Rather different from your own chief’s, no doubt. But the
new underground will take another ten years to complete,
and there is little office space in Tokyo. It crossed my mind
to make use of this disused station. It is quiet. It is private.
It is also cool. I shall be sorry when the trains begin to run
and we shall have to move out.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond took the proffered chair across the empty desk
from Tanaka. “It’s a brilliant idea. And I enjoyed the
folkways above our heads. Are there really so many people
in the world interested in folkways?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger Tanaka shrugged. “What does it matter? The
literature is given away free. I have never asked the director
who reads it. Americans, I expect, and Germans.
Perhaps some Swiss. The serious-minded can always be
found for such stuff. It is an expensive conceit, of course.
But fortunately the expense is not carried by the Ministry
of Internal Affairs, with whom I am concerned. Down
here, we have to count our pennies. I suppose it is the
same with your own budget.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond assumed that this man would know the published
facts of the Secret Service Vote. He said, “Under ten million
pounds a year doesn’t go far when there is the whole
world to cover.”</p>

<p class="pindent">The teeth glistened under the neon strip lighting. “At
least for the last ten years you have saved money by closing
down your activities in this part of the world.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes. We rely on the C.I.A. to do our work here for us.
They are most efficient and helpful.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“As much so under McCone as under Dulles?”</p>

<p class="pindent">The old fox! “Nearly so. Nowadays they are even more
inclined to regard the Pacific as their own back garden.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“From which you wish to borrow the mowing machine.
Without them knowing.” Tiger’s smile was even more
tigerish.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond had to laugh. The wily devil had certainly been
putting two and two together. When Bond laughed, Tiger
also laughed, but carefully. Bond said, “We had a man
called Captain Cook and various others who discovered
much of this garden. Australia and New Zealand are two
very great countries. You must admit that our interest
in this half of the world is perfectly legitimate.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“My dear Commander. You were lucky that we struck
at Pearl Harbour rather than at Australia. Can you doubt
that we would have occupied that country and New Zealand
if we had done otherwise? These are big and important
land spaces, insufficiently developed. You could not
have defended them. The Americans would not have. If
our policy had been different, we would now own half the
British Commonwealth. Personally, I have never understood
the strategy behind Pearl Harbour. Did we wish to
conquer America? The supply lines were too long. But
Australia and New Zealand were ripe for the plucking.”
He pushed forward a large box of cigarettes. “Do you
smoke? These are Shinsei. It is an acceptable brand.”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond was running out of his Morland specials. He
would soon have to start on the local stuff. He also had to
collect his thoughts. This was rather like being involved
in a summit meeting between the United Kingdom and
Japan. He felt way out of his depth. He took a cigarette
and lit it. It burned rapidly with something of the effect
of a slow-burning firework. It had a vague taste of American
blends, but it was good and sharp on the palate and
lungs, like 90 proof spirits. He let the smoke out in a quiet
hiss and smiled. “Mr. Tanaka, these are matters for political
historians. I am concerned with much lower matters. And
matters concerning the future rather than the past.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I quite understand, Commander.” Tiger Tanaka was
obviously displeased that his game of generalities had been
dodged by Bond. “But we have a saying ‘Speak of next
year and the devil laughs.’ The future is inscrutable. But
tell me, what are your impressions of Japan? You have
been enjoying yourself?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I imagine that one always enjoys oneself with Dikko
Henderson.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes, he is a man who lives as if he were going to die
tomorrow. This is a correct way to live. He is a good
friend of mine. I greatly enjoy his company. We have
certain tastes in common.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond said ironically, “Folkways?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Exactly.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“He has a great affection for you. I do not know him
well, but I suspect that he is a lonely man. It is an unfortunate
combination to be both lonely and intelligent.
Wouldn’t it be a good thing for him to marry a Japanese
girl and settle down? Couldn’t you find him one?” Bond
was pleased that the conversation had descended to personalities.
He sensed that he was on the right track. At
least on a better track than this talk about power politics.
But there would come a bad moment when he would have
to get down to business. He didn’t care for the prospect.</p>

<p class="pindent">As if he had sensed this, Tiger Tanaka said, “I have
arranged for our friend to meet many Japanese girls. The
result in every case has been negative or, at the best,
fleeting. But tell me, Commander. We have not met here
to discuss Mr. Henderson’s private life. In what respect can
I be of service to you? Is it the lawn mower?”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond smiled. “It is. The manufacturers’ trade-mark for
this particular implement is <span class="sc">magic</span> 44.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Ah yes. A most valuable implement of many uses. I
can understand that your country would wish to have the
services of this implement. A case in point is an example of
its capabilities which came into my hands only this morning.”
Tiger Tanaka opened a drawer in his desk and
extracted a file. It was a pale green file stamped in a square
box with the word <span class="sc">gokuhi</span> in black Roman characters.
Bond assumed this to be the equivalent of top secret. He
put this to Mr. Tanaka, who confirmed it. Mr. Tanaka
opened the file and extracted two sheets of yellow paper.
Bond could see that one was covered with Japanese characters
and that the other had perhaps fifty lines of typewriting.
Mr. Tanaka slipped the typewritten one across the
desk. He said, “May I beg you on oath not to reveal to
anyone what you are about to read?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“If you insist, Mr. Tanaka.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I am afraid I must, Commander.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“So be it.” Bond drew the sheet of paper towards him.
The text was in English. This is what it said:</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond pushed the document away from him as if
he feared contamination from it. He let out his breath in
a quiet hiss. He reached for the box of Shinsei and lit one,
drawing the harsh smoke deep down into his lungs. He
raised his eyes to Mr. Tanaka’s, which were regarding him
with polite interest. “I suppose Number One is Khrushchev?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That is correct, and the meaning of stations grade two
and above is consulates-general and embassies. It is interesting
material, is it not?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It is a mistake that you are keeping this material from
us. We have a treaty of friendship and a trade treaty with
you. Do you not regard the withholding of this vital information
as a dishonourable act?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Honour is a very serious word in Japan, Commander.
Would it not be even more dishonourable to break our
word to our good American friends? They have several
times assured me and my government that any information
of vital importance to our other friends and allies will
be passed on to them in such a way as not to divulge the
source. I have no evidence that they are not pursuing this
routine.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“You know as well as I do, Mr. Tanaka, that rewriting
and doctoring to conceal the source reduces this type of
material to a grade no higher than secret reports from
countless other ‘delicate and reliable’ sources. The nature
of this particular source, the fact that one is reading the
very words of the enemy, is at least fifty per cent of the
value of the information this message contains. No doubt
Washington will pass on a garbled version of this message
to London. I hope they already have. But you realize that
it might be in their interests to keep quiet about this terrible
threat that hangs over England? At the same time,
it is in England’s interest to use every hour in devising
some counter to this plan. One small step, which at once
comes to mind, is preparations for the internment of all
Soviet citizens in Britain at the first sign of the evacuation
measures mentioned in the message.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“I appreciate your point of view, Commander. There is,
of course, in this instance, an alternative route for this
information to reach your government.” Mr. Tanaka’s
face crinkled wickedly.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond leant urgently over the desk. “But I gave my word
of honour!”</p>

<p class="pindent">Mr. Tanaka’s face underwent a curious change. All the
upward lines turned downwards. The dark eyes lost their
glitter and assumed an inward look. In a curious way, the
whole face slumped into melancholy. He said, “Commander,
I was very happy in England. Your people were very
good to me. I repaid them in an unworthy fashion.” (Ah!
thought Bond. The ON.) “I plead youth and the heat
of a war that I thought would bring much glory to my
country. I was mistaken. We were defeated. The expiation
of that dishonour is a large matter, a matter for the youth
of this country. I am not a politician and I do not know
what course that expiation will take. At present we are
going through the usual transition period of the vanquished.
But I, Tanaka, have my own private accounting
to balance. I am in great debt to your country. This morning
I have betrayed a state secret to you. I was encouraged
in my action by my friendship for Dikko. I was also encouraged
by the sincerity of your bearing and the honesty
of your approach to the duty that has been laid upon you.
I fully realize the importance of this piece of paper to
Britain. You remember its contents?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Exactly, I think.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“And you are on your honour not to communicate it
elsewhere.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Tiger Tanaka got to his feet and held out his hand.
“Good-bye for the time being, Commander. I hope that we
shall be seeing more of each other.” The powerful face lit
up again. Now there was no pretence in the great golden
smile. “Honour is a pattern of behaviour, Commander.
The bamboo must bend to the breeze. But equally the
cedar must bend to the typhoon. The meaning of this is
that sometimes duty is more compelling than any words.
A car is waiting to take you back to your hotel. Please give
my deep respects to Dikko and tell him he owes me one
thousand yen for repairs to electronic equipment that is
the property of the state.”</p>

<p class="pindent">James Bond took the hard dry paw. He said from his
heart, “Thank you, Mr. Tanaka.” He walked out of the
little secret room with one thought uppermost in his mind.
How fast were Dikko’s communications to Melbourne?
How fast from Melbourne to London?</p>
