<p class="line8"><span class="sc">The dreamed screams</span> had merged into real ones when,
four hours later, Bond awoke. There was silence in the
hut. Bond got cautiously to his knees and put his eye to
a wide crack in the rickety planking. A screaming man,
from his ragged blue cotton uniform a Japanese peasant,
was running across his line of vision along the edge of the
lake. Four guards were after him, laughing and calling as
if it were a game of hide-and-seek. They were carrying
long staves, and now one of them paused and hurled his
stave accurately after the man so that it caught in his legs
and brought him crashing to the ground. He scrambled to
his knees and held supplicating hands out towards his pursuers.
Still laughing, they gathered round him, stocky men
in high rubber boots, their faces made terrifying by the
black <span class="it">maskos</span> over their mouths, black leather nose-pieces,
and the same ugly black leather soup-plate hats as the
agent on the train had worn. They poked at the man with
the ends of their staves, at the same time shouting harshly
at him in voices that jeered. Then, as if at an order, they
bent down and, each man seizing a leg or an arm, picked
him off the ground, swung him once or twice, and tossed
him out into the lake. The ghastly ripple surged forward,
and the man, now screaming again, beat at his face with
his hands and floundered as if trying to make for the
shore, but the screams rapidly became weaker and finally
ceased as the head went down and the red stain spread
wider and wider.</p>

<p class="pindent">Doubled up with laughter, the guards on the bank
watched the show. Now, satisfied that the fun was over,
they turned away and walked towards the hut, and Bond
could see the tears of their pleasure glistening on their
cheeks.</p>

<p class="pindent">He got back under cover and heard their boisterous
voices and laughter only yards away as they came into
the hut and pulled out their rakes and barrows and dispersed
to their jobs, and for some time Bond could hear
them calling to each other across the park. Then, from
the direction of the castle, came the deep tolling of a bell,
and the men fell silent. Bond glanced at the cheap Japanese
wrist-watch Tiger had provided. It was nine o’clock.
Was this the beginning of the official working day? Probably.
The Japanese usually get to their work half an hour
early and leave half an hour late in order to gain face with
their employer and show keenness and gratitude for their
jobs. Later, Bond guessed, there would be an hour’s luncheon
break. Work would probably cease at six. So it would
only be from six-thirty on that he would have the grounds
to himself. Meanwhile, he must listen and watch and find
out more about the guards’ routines, of which he had presumably
witnessed the first—the smelling out and final dispatch
of suicides who had changed their minds or turned
faint-hearted during the night. Bond softly unzipped his
container and took a bite at one of his three slabs of pemmican
and a short draught from his water-bottle. God, for
a cigarette!</p>

<p class="pindent">An hour later, Bond heard a brief shuffling of feet on
the gravel path on the other side of the lake. He looked
through the slit. The four guards had lined up and were
standing rigidly to attention. Bond’s heart beat a little
faster. This would be for some form of inspection. Might
Blofeld be doing his rounds, getting his reports of the
night’s bag?</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond strained his eyes to the right, towards the castle,
but his view was obstructed by an expanse of white oleanders,
that innocent shrub with its attractive clusters of
blossom that is used as a deadly fish poison in many parts
of the tropics. Dear, pretty bush! Bond thought. I must
remember to keep clear of you tonight.</p>

<p class="pindent">And then, following the path on the other side of the
lake, two strolling figures came into his line of vision, and
Bond clenched his fists with the thrill of seeing his prey.</p>

<p class="pindent">Blofeld, in his gleaming chain armour and grotesquely
spiked and winged helmet of steel, its visor closed, was
something out of Wagner, or, because of the Oriental style
of his armour, a Japanese <span class="it">Kabuki</span> play. His armoured right
hand rested easily on a long naked <span class="it">samurai</span> sword, while
his left was hooked into the arm of his companion, a
stumpy woman with the body and stride of a wardress.
Her face was totally obscured by a hideous bee-keeper’s
hat of dark-green straw with a heavy pendent black veil
reaching down over her shoulders. But there could be no
doubt! Bond had seen that dumpy silhouette, now clothed
in a plastic rainproof above tall rubber boots, too often
in his dreams. That was her! That was Irma Bunt!</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond held his breath. If they came round the lake to
his side, one tremendous shove and the armoured man
would be floundering in the water! But could the piranhas
get at him through chinks in the armour? Unlikely! And
how would he, Bond, get away? No, that wouldn’t be the
answer.</p>

<p class="pindent">The two figures had almost reached the line of four
men, and at this moment the guards dropped to their knees
in unison and bowed their foreheads down to the ground.
Then they quickly jumped up and stood again at attention.</p>

<p class="pindent">Blofeld raised his visor and addressed one of the men,
who answered with deference. Bond noticed for the first
time that this particular guard wore a belt round his waist
with a holstered automatic. Bond couldn’t hear the language
they were speaking. It was impossible that Blofeld
had learned Japanese. English or German? Probably the
latter, as a result of some wartime liaison job. The man
laughed and pointed towards the lake, where a collapsed
balloon of blue clothing was jigging softly with the activities
of the horde of feasting piranhas within it. Blofeld
nodded his approval, and the men again went down on
their knees. Blofeld raised a hand in brief acknowledgement,
lowered his visor, and the couple moved regally on.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond watched carefully to see if the file of guards, when
they got to their feet, registered any private expressions of
scorn or hilarity once the Master’s back was turned. But
there was no hint of disrespect. The men broke ranks and
hurried off about their tasks with disciplined seriousness,
and Bond was reminded of Dikko Henderson’s illustration
of the automatic ant-like subservience to discipline and
authority of the Japanese that had resulted in one of the
great crimes of the century. If only dear Dikko were here
now. What a tremendous boost his fists and his surging
zest would add to this lunatic operation!</p>

<p class="pindent">The crime had concerned, said Dikko, a modest suburban
branch of the Imperial Bank. It had been a normal
day of business, when a man wearing an official-looking
arm-band had presented himself to the manager of the
bank. He was from the Ministry of Health. An outbreak
of typhus was feared, and he would be obliged if the
manager would line up his staff in the courtyard so that
he could administer the official antidote. The manager
bowed and complied, and after everything had been locked
up, the staff of fourteen assembled and listened carefully
to the short lecture on health delivered by the man with
the arm-band. Then everyone had bowed in acknowledgement
of the wisdom of the Ministry of Health, and the
official had bent to his small suit-case and produced fifteen
glasses into which he measured medicine from a bottle. He
handed a glass to each person and advised them to swallow
the mixture at one gulp as otherwise it might damage
their teeth. “Now,” he had said, according to Dikko’s
version. “All together! One. Two. Three!” And down
went the honourable medicine and down fell the honourable
local manager and staff of the Imperial Bank of Japan.
The medicine had been neat cyanide.</p>

<p class="pindent">The “Ministry of Health official” had removed the keys
from the trouser-pocket of the prone manager, had loaded
up his car with two hundred and fifty million yen, and
had driven cheerfully from the scene of what was to become
known as the “Teigin case,” after the suburb in
which it took place.</p>

<p class="pindent">And here, Bond reflected, was the same total obedience
to authority, but in this case the tacit approval and sympathy
of the Black Dragon philosophy was operating. Blofeld
told them to do such things as he had witnessed a
couple of hours before. He was invested with power from
certain departments of state. He had dressed for the part.
His orders were obeyed. And there was honourable job to
be done. Honourable job which resulted in much publicity
in the newspapers. And this was a powerful <span class="it">gaijin</span> who
had powerful squeeze in high places and “a wide face.”
And if people wanted to kill themselves, why worry? If
the Castle of Death, with perhaps an occasional extra push,
was not available, they would choose the railways or the
trams. Here was a public service. Almost a sub-department
of the Ministry of Health! So long as their <span class="it">maskos</span> and
nose-pieces protected them from the poisons in the garden,
the main thing was to do their jobs conscientiously, and
perhaps one day they would get a Minister of Self-Destruction
appointed in the Diet! Then the great days of
the Black Dragon <span class="it">Kōan</span> would come again to save the
Land of the Rising Sun from the creeping paralysis of
<span class="it">demokorasu</span>!</p>

<p class="pindent">Now the two strolling figures were coming back into
Bond’s line of vision, but this time from the left. They
had rounded the end of the lake and were on their way
back, perhaps to visit other groups of guards and get their
reports. Tiger had said there were at least twenty guards
and that the property covered five hundred acres. Five
working parties of four guards each? Blofeld’s visor was
up, and he was talking to the woman. They were now only
twenty yards away. They stopped at the edge of the lake
and contemplated, with relaxed curiosity, the still turbulent
mass of fish round the floating doll of blue cloth.
They were talking German. Bond strained his ears.</p>

<p class="pindent">Blofeld said, “The piranhas and the volcanic mud are
useful housekeepers. They keep the place tidy.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“The sea and the sharks are also useful.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“But often the sharks do not complete the job. That
spy we put through the Question Room. He was almost
intact when his body was found down the coast. The lake
would have been a better place for him. We don’t want
that policeman from Fukuoka coming here too often. He
may have means of learning from the peasants how many
people are crossing the wall. That will be many more,
nearly double the number the ambulance comes for. If our
figures go on increasing at this rate, there is going to be
trouble. I see from the cuttings Kono translates for me
that there are already mutterings in the papers about a
public enquiry.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“And what shall we do then, lieber Ernst?”</p>

<p class="pindent">“We shall obtain massive compensation and move on.
The same pattern can be repeated in other countries.
Everywhere there are people who want to kill themselves.
We may have to vary the attractions of the opportunities
we offer them. Other people have not the profound love
of horror and violence of the Japanese. A really beautiful
waterfall. A handy bridge. A vertiginous drop. These
might be alternatives. Brazil, or somewhere else in South
America, might provide such a site.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“But the figures would be much smaller.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“It is the concept that matters, liebe Irma. It is very
difficult to invent something that is entirely new in the
history of the world. I have done that. If my bridge, my
waterfall, yields a crop of only perhaps ten people a year,
it is simply a matter of statistics. The basic idea will be
kept alive.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“That is so. You are indeed a genius, lieber Ernst. You
have already established this place as a shrine to death for
evermore. People read about such fantasies in the works of
Poe, Lautréamont, de Sade, but no one has ever created
such a fantasy in real life. It is as if one of the great fairytales
has come to life. A sort of Disneyland of Death. But
of course,” she hastened to add, “on an altogether grander,
more poetic scale.”</p>

<p class="pindent">“In due course, I shall write the whole story down. Then
perhaps the world will acknowledge the type of man who
has been living among them. A man not only unhonoured
and unsung, but a man”—Blofeld’s voice rose almost to a
scream—“whom they hunt down and wish to shoot like a
mad dog. A man who has to use all his wiles just to stay
alive! Why, if I had not covered my tracks so well, there
would be spies on their way even now to kill us both or
to hand us over for official murder under their stupid
laws! Ah well, liebe Irma,” the voice was more rational,
quieter, “we live in a world of fools in which true greatness
is a sin. Come! It is time to review the other detachments.”</p>

<p class="pindent">They turned away and were about to continue along
the lake when Blofeld suddenly stopped and pointed like
a dog directly at Bond. “That hut among the bushes. The
door is open! I have told the men a thousand times to keep
such places locked. It is a perfect refuge for a spy or a
fugitive. I will make sure.”</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond shivered. He huddled down, dragging sacks from
the top of his barrier to give extra protection. The clanking
steps approached, entered the hut. Bond could feel the
man, only yards away, could feel his questing eyes and
nostrils. There came a clang of metal, and the wall of sacks
shook at great thrusts from Blofeld’s sword. Then the
sword slashed down again and again. Bond winced and
bit his lip as a hammer-blow crashed across the centre of
his back. But then Blofeld seemed to be satisfied, and the
iron steps clanged away. Bond let out his breath in a quiet
hiss. He heard Blofeld’s voice say, “There is nothing, but
remind me to reprimand Kono on our rounds tomorrow.
The place must be cleared out and a proper lock fitted.”
Then the sound of the steps vanished in the direction of
the oleander clump, and Bond gave a groan and felt his
back. But, though many of the sacks above him had been
sliced through, his protection had been just deep enough—the
skin across his spine wasn’t broken.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond got to his knees and rearranged the hide-out, massaging
his aching back as he did so. Then he spat the dust
from the sacking out of his mouth, took a swallow from
the water-bottle, assured himself through his slit that there
was no movement outside, and lay down and let his mind
wander back over every word that Blofeld had uttered.</p>

<p class="pindent">Of course the man was mad. A year earlier, the usual
quiet tones that Bond remembered so well would never
have cracked into that lunatic, Hitler scream. And the
coolness, the supreme confidence that had always lain behind
his planning? Much of that seemed to have seeped
away, perhaps, Bond hoped, partly because of the two
great failures he, Bond, had done much to bring about
in two of Blofeld’s most grandiose conspiracies. But one
thing was clear—the hide-out was blown. Tonight would
have to be the night. Ah, well! Once again Bond ran over
the hazy outline of his plan. If he could gain access to
the castle, he felt pretty confident of finding a means to
kill Blofeld. But he was also fairly certain that he himself
would die in the process. Dulce et decorum est . . . and
all that jazz! But then he thought of Kissy, and he wasn’t
so sure about not fearing for himself. She had brought a
sweetness back into his life that he thought had gone for
ever.</p>

<p class="pindent">Bond dropped off into an uneasy watchful sleep that was
once again peopled by things and creatures out of nightmareland.</p>
